1	0	RADDATZ Good evening to you all.
2	0	RADDATZ The rules for tonight are very basic and have been agreed to by all three campaigns in advance.
3	0	RADDATZ Candidates can take up to a minute-and-a-half to respond directly to a question.
4	0	RADDATZ "For a rebuttal, for a follow-up, 45 seconds will be allowed."
5	0	RADDATZ "There are green, yellow, and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is running out and when they're supposed to be finished with their answers."
6	0	MUIR "We will be tackling many critical issues right here tonight, and we begin with opening statements, in alphabetical order, and Secretary Clinton."
7	0	CLINTON "Well, thank you."
8	0	CLINTON And I'm delighted to be here in New Hampshire for this debate.
9	0	CLINTON "You know, the American president has to both keep our families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not just those at the top."
10	0	CLINTON That's the job.
11	0	CLINTON "I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night."
12	0	CLINTON I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.
13	0	CLINTON "From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made."
14	0	CLINTON "They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it."
15	0	CLINTON "They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class."
16	0	CLINTON "And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns."
17	0	CLINTON "So we have a lot of work to do in this campaign to make it clear where we stand in the Democratic Party, what we will do for our country, and I look forward to this evening's discussion of real issues that face the American people."
18	0	CLINTON Thank you.
19	0	RADDATZ "Thank you, Secretary Clinton."
20	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
21	0	RADDATZ Governor O'Malley?
22	0	O'MALLEY "Martha, thank you."
23	0	O'MALLEY "Tonight we have a different debate than the debates that we have been allowed to have so far, because tonight is different because of this reason, that in the course of this presidential campaign America has again been attacked by jihadi terrorists, American lives taken from us."
24	0	O'MALLEY "So, yes, we must talk about our ideas to move our economy forward, but the first job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of the United States."
25	0	O'MALLEY I visited with a number of our neighbors in Northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday.
26	0	O'MALLEY "And as I looked out there at the eyes of our neighbors, I also looked in the eyes of veterans."
27	0	O'MALLEY I looked into the eyes of Boy Scouts.
28	0	O'MALLEY I looked into the eyes of moms and dads who would do anything in their power to protect our country's values and our freedoms.
29	0	O'MALLEY "What our nation needs right now is to realize that, while we face a terrible danger, we also face a different sort of political danger."
30	0	O'MALLEY And that is the danger that democracies find themselves susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders try to turn us upon each other.
31	0	O'MALLEY What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.
32	0	O'MALLEY We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.
33	0	O'MALLEY "But we will only do so if we hold true to the values and the freedoms that unite us, which means we must never surrender them to terrorists, must never surrender our Americans values to racist, must never surrender to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths."
34	0	O'MALLEY We are a better country than this.
35	0	O'MALLEY "Our enduring symbol is not the barbed wire fence, it is the Statue of Liberty."
36	0	O'MALLEY And America's best days are in front of us if we move forward together.
37	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
38	0	MUIR Senator Sanders.
39	0	SANDERS Good evening.
40	0	SANDERS I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.
41	0	SANDERS I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.
42	0	SANDERS I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.
43	0	SANDERS "I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families."
44	0	SANDERS I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
45	0	SANDERS "I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground."
46	0	SANDERS That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.
47	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
48	0	MUIR Senator Sanders thank you and thank you all.
49	0	MUIR We do have a lot of important issues to get here tonight and we want to address the controversy of the last 24 hours right off the top because we heard some of the most heated rhetoric of the campaign so far between two of the campaigns on this stage tonight.
50	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, you fired a campaign staffer you have sued the Democratic National Committee; all of this after your campaign acknowledge that some of your staffers quote, ""irresponsibly accessed data from another campaign."""
51	0	MUIR "The Clinton campaign called this a very egregious breech of data of ethics and said, quote, ""our data was stolen."""
52	0	MUIR Did they overstate this or were your staffers essentially stealing part of the Clinton playbook?
53	0	SANDERS "David, let me give you a little bit of background here."
54	0	SANDERS The DNC has hired vendors.
55	0	SANDERS "On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago."
56	0	SANDERS Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.
57	0	SANDERS "And when our staffers said, ""whoa, what's going here?"""
58	0	SANDERS They went to the DNC quietly.
59	0	SANDERS "They went to the vendor and said, ""hey, something is wrong,"" and that was quietly dealt with."
60	0	SANDERS None of that information was looked at.
61	0	SANDERS Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.
62	0	SANDERS A few days ago a similar incident happened.
63	0	SANDERS "There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign."
64	0	SANDERS "In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information."
65	0	SANDERS As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.
66	0	SANDERS We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.
67	0	SANDERS "Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem."
68	0	SANDERS But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.
69	0	SANDERS That is an egregious act.
70	0	SANDERS "I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved."
71	0	SANDERS "Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign."
72	0	SANDERS Don't know that.
73	0	SANDERS "But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that."
74	0	SANDERS Last point.
75	0	SANDERS "When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it."
76	0	SANDERS "And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later."
77	0	MUIR "But Senator, you do mention the DNC -- the vender."
78	0	MUIR But you said of your staff that they did the wrong thing.
79	0	SANDERS Absolutely.
80	0	SANDERS Bernie Sanders apologizes to Hillary Clinton
81	0	SANDERS "At ABC's Democratic presidential debate, candidate Bernie Sanders apologizes to rival Hillary Clinton for a scandal involving key voter data."
82	0	MUIR "So, does Secretary Clinton deserve an apology tonight?"
83	0	SANDERS "Yes, I apologize."
84	0	MUIR Secretary Clinton...
85	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
86	0	SANDERS Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.
87	0	SANDERS This is not the type of campaign that we run.
88	0	SANDERS "And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired."
89	0	MUIR "Secretary Clinton, he has apologized."
90	0	MUIR How do your react?
91	0	CLINTON "I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie."
92	0	CLINTON It really is important that we go forward on this.
93	0	CLINTON "I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen."
94	0	CLINTON "Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us."
95	0	CLINTON "And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on."
96	0	CLINTON Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.
97	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
98	0	CLINTON I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.
99	0	O'MALLEY "Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare."
100	0	O'MALLEY Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.
101	0	O'MALLEY You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?
102	0	O'MALLEY "Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids."
103	0	O'MALLEY "Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth."
104	0	O'MALLEY "Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party."
105	0	O'MALLEY "We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table."
106	0	O'MALLEY "And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward."
107	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
108	0	MUIR All three candidates are weighing in.
109	0	SANDERS Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.
110	0	SANDERS "You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails."
111	0	SANDERS Right?
112	0	SANDERS "And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues."
113	0	SANDERS Media notwithstanding.
114	0	SANDERS Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.
115	0	SANDERS I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.
116	0	MUIR "Good let's move on -- Senator Sanders, let's move on right to some of those issues."
117	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
118	0	MUIR "It is just six days before Christmas, as we all know in this country."
119	0	MUIR "It's typically a joyful time, as it is this year, as well."
120	0	MUIR But it's also an anxious time.
121	0	MUIR President Obama has acknowledged that what we saw in San Bernardino was an act of terrorism.
122	0	MUIR "But we remember the president said, right before Thanksgiving, there is no known specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland."
123	0	MUIR We now know that this couple had assembled an arsenal.
124	0	MUIR They were not on law enforcement's radar.
125	0	MUIR They were completely undetected.
126	0	MUIR "So as we approach another holiday, with the president again saying, late this week, no credible threat, Secretary Clinton, how confident should the American people be, that there aren't others like that couple right now in the U.S. going undetected?"
127	0	MUIR And what would you do as president to find them?
128	0	CLINTON "Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe."
129	0	CLINTON I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.
130	0	CLINTON "Not to contain them, but to defeat them."
131	0	CLINTON And it has three parts.
132	0	CLINTON "First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq."
133	0	CLINTON "Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism."
134	0	CLINTON "And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe."
135	0	CLINTON "Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do."
136	0	CLINTON "Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground."
137	0	CLINTON "Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond."
138	0	CLINTON "And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right."
139	0	CLINTON We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.
140	0	CLINTON "That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence."
141	0	CLINTON That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.
142	0	CLINTON "They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists."
143	0	CLINTON We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.
144	0	CLINTON And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.
145	0	CLINTON "Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization."
146	0	CLINTON They will be our early warning signal.
147	0	CLINTON "That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing."
148	0	O'MALLEY "David, I am the very first..."
149	0	MUIR (inaudible) thank you.
150	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
151	0	MUIR I am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor.
152	0	MUIR "I understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like San Bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders."
153	0	MUIR "Many of the things Secretary Clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing."
154	0	MUIR "Not only in theater, in Syria and Iraq and other places where we embalk (ph) ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies."
155	0	MUIR "I believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but it's a lack of battle tempo."
156	0	MUIR "We have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future."
157	0	MUIR "And we're going to break down these issues tonight, but I do want to go to Senator Sanders because the concern going into Christmas is significant, as you know."
158	0	MUIR A new ABC News poll shows 77 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in the government's ability to prevent a lone wolf attack.
159	0	MUIR How would you specifically find would-be terrorist who are going undetected?
160	0	SANDERS I'm one of the 77 percent.
161	0	SANDERS I think this is a very difficult issue.
162	0	SANDERS Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
163	0	SANDERS Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.
164	0	SANDERS I think it's a two-pronged issue.
165	0	SANDERS "Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS."
166	0	SANDERS What is the best way to do it?
167	0	SANDERS "Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself."
168	0	SANDERS I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.
169	0	SANDERS I do not believe in unilateral American action.
170	0	SANDERS "I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations."
171	0	SANDERS "I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan."
172	0	SANDERS This small country has welcomed in many refugees.
173	0	SANDERS "And Abdullah said something recently, very important."
174	0	SANDERS "He said, ""Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam. We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground."""
175	0	SANDERS And I believe he is absolutely right.
176	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
177	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, in the wake of the San Bernardino attack, you all emphasized gun control."
178	0	RADDATZ "But our latest poll shows that more Americans believe arming people, not stricter gun laws, is the best defense against terrorism."
179	0	RADDATZ Are they wrong?
180	0	CLINTON "Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us."
181	0	CLINTON "Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take."
182	0	CLINTON "You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that."
183	0	CLINTON We've got to build a coalition abroad.
184	0	CLINTON We also have to build a coalition at home.
185	0	CLINTON "Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS."
186	0	CLINTON I know how hard that is.
187	0	CLINTON I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...
188	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, can we stick to gun control?"
189	0	CLINTON "Yes, I'm getting..."
190	0	RADDATZ Are they wrong?
191	0	CLINTON I'm getting to that.
192	0	CLINTON "Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home."
193	0	CLINTON "Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer."
194	1	CLINTON "We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism."
195	0	CLINTON I think what is...
196	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
197	0	CLINTON "Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country."
198	0	CLINTON The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.
199	0	CLINTON People who we should be welcoming and working with.
200	0	CLINTON "I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a ""clash of civilizations,"" that there is some kind of Western plot or even ""war against Islam,"" which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization."
201	0	CLINTON "So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States."
202	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
203	0	RADDATZ "Senator Sanders -- wait just a moment, please, Governor O'Malley."
204	0	RADDATZ "Senator Sanders, we've seen those long lines of people buying guns in record numbers after the Paris attacks."
205	0	RADDATZ Would you discourage people from buying a gun?
206	0	SANDERS It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.
207	0	SANDERS "I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners."
208	0	SANDERS That's the right of people.
209	0	SANDERS But this is what I do believe.
210	0	SANDERS "I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations."
211	0	SANDERS "For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check."
212	0	SANDERS Who denies that it is crazy...
213	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
214	0	SANDERS Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?
215	0	SANDERS We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.
216	0	SANDERS "In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians."
217	0	SANDERS I think there is a consensus.
218	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
219	0	SANDERS I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.
220	0	SANDERS It's a divided country on guns.
221	0	SANDERS "But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together."
222	0	O'MALLEY "Martha, if I may..."
223	0	RADDATZ "Thank you, Senator Sanders."
224	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
225	0	RADDATZ I think we're going to go on...
226	0	O'MALLEY "Excuse me, no."
227	0	MUIR "Governor, we have to abide the rules here, we'll call on you here shortly, but..."
228	0	O'MALLEY I am the only person on this stage who has actually...
229	0	MUIR But I do want pick up on something...
230	0	O'MALLEY "... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David."
231	0	O'MALLEY "And, look, there are profound differences..."
232	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
233	1	O'MALLEY Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.
234	1	O'MALLEY Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.
235	1	O'MALLEY And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.
236	1	O'MALLEY "Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards."
237	0	O'MALLEY "Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls."
238	0	O'MALLEY We need more principle.
239	0	O'MALLEY "When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up."
240	0	O'MALLEY We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.
241	0	RADDATZ "Governor, now -- and let me stay with gun control for a minute, then."
242	0	RADDATZ You talk about assault weapons.
243	0	RADDATZ "Even if you were able to ban the purchase of assault weapons tomorrow, Americans already own an estimated 7 to 10 million semi-automatic rifles."
244	0	RADDATZ "Would you make it illegal to own those weapons, force people to turn them in?"
245	0	RADDATZ "And if not, how would banning the sales really make a difference?"
246	0	O'MALLEY "Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons."
247	0	O'MALLEY "You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet..."
248	0	RADDATZ "But, again, I'm not talking about buying."
249	0	RADDATZ Would you have them confiscated?
250	0	RADDATZ The ones that are already here?
251	0	O'MALLEY "No, Martha, I would not."
252	0	O'MALLEY And that's not what we did in Maryland.
253	0	O'MALLEY But you know what we did in Maryland?
254	0	O'MALLEY We overcame the NRA's objections.
255	0	O'MALLEY We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.
256	0	O'MALLEY We did our own rallies.
257	0	O'MALLEY "And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country."
258	0	O'MALLEY "ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show."
259	0	O'MALLEY "And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years."
260	0	SANDERS "Whoa, whoa, whoa."
261	0	SANDERS "Let's calm down a little bit, Martin."
262	0	CLINTON "Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin."
263	0	O'MALLEY I am telling the truth.
264	0	SANDERS "First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators."
265	0	MUIR We will.
266	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
267	0	SANDERS All right.
268	0	MUIR "But let me just establish that for you, senator."
269	0	MUIR "Really quickly governor, we are going to call on you tonight and it's very clear you have a lot to say but please wait until you're called upon."
270	0	MUIR "And senator, he invoked your record and I'll let you respond."
271	0	SANDERS He sure did.
272	0	MUIR I'll let you respond.
273	0	CLINTON He invoked mine as well.
274	0	MUIR And you will get some to as well.
275	0	SANDERS Sure did.
276	0	SANDERS All right.
277	0	SANDERS "First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus."
278	0	SANDERS "In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House."
279	0	SANDERS "We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race."
280	0	SANDERS "One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly."
281	0	SANDERS "Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders."
282	0	SANDERS I lost that election by three percentage points.
283	0	SANDERS "Quite likely, for that reason."
284	0	SANDERS "So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control."
285	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
286	0	SANDERS Excuse me.
287	0	SANDERS "Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety."
288	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
289	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
290	0	MUIR I want to move on here.
291	0	MUIR "Secretary Clinton, you brought up Donald Trump a short time ago."
292	0	CLINTON I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.
293	0	CLINTON I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.
294	0	CLINTON And I applaud his record in Maryland.
295	0	CLINTON I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.
296	0	CLINTON "I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons."
297	0	CLINTON I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.
298	0	CLINTON And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.
299	0	CLINTON "I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby."
300	0	CLINTON "And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity."
301	0	CLINTON We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.
302	0	CLINTON It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.
303	0	CLINTON "We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem."
304	0	CLINTON And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.
305	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
306	0	MUIR "Secretary Clinton, thank you."
307	0	MUIR We're going to move on from guns here and go back to something you mentioned a short time ago.
308	0	MUIR You brought up Donald Trump first here this evening.
309	0	MUIR We've now seen the polling done well after his proposed ban on Muslims coming to America.
310	0	MUIR "Thirty-six percent of Americans, more than a third, agree with him."
311	0	MUIR You have weighed in already on Donald Trump.
312	0	MUIR You've weighed in on the proposed ban.
313	0	MUIR But what would you say to the millions of Americans watching tonight who agree with him?
314	0	MUIR Are they wrong?
315	0	CLINTON Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.
316	0	CLINTON "First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino."
317	0	CLINTON And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.
318	0	CLINTON "So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face."
319	0	CLINTON "We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear."
320	0	CLINTON Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.
321	0	CLINTON "You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks."
322	0	CLINTON "One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together."
323	0	CLINTON "You are not our adversary, you are our partner."
324	0	CLINTON And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.
325	0	CLINTON He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.
326	1	CLINTON They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.
327	0	CLINTON So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.
328	0	MUIR "Secretary, thank you."
329	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, I did want to ask you about a neighbor in San Bernardino who reportedly witnessed packages being delivered to that couple's home, that it set off red flags, but they didn't report it because they were afraid to profile."
330	0	MUIR What would you say to Americans afraid to profile?
331	0	MUIR Is it ever acceptable?
332	0	SANDERS "Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it."
333	0	SANDERS That's kind of a no-brainer.
334	0	SANDERS "You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911."
335	0	SANDERS Do it.
336	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
337	0	MUIR But I'm asking about -- I'm asking about profiling.
338	0	MUIR Because a lot of people are afraid of that.
339	0	SANDERS "But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points."
340	0	SANDERS What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.
341	0	SANDERS The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.
342	0	SANDERS They are anxious on a number of levels.
343	0	SANDERS They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.
344	0	SANDERS We all understand that.
345	0	SANDERS But you know what else they're anxious about?
346	0	SANDERS "They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent."
347	0	SANDERS "And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?"
348	0	SANDERS What are you going to do for my kids?
349	0	SANDERS "And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, ""I know the answers. The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans. Those are your enemies. We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists. We've got to hate the Muslims."""
350	0	SANDERS "Meanwhile, the rich get richer."
351	0	SANDERS "So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea."
352	0	SANDERS He thinks low wages are a good idea.
353	0	SANDERS "I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from."
354	0	SANDERS "Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top."
355	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
356	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
357	0	RADDATZ I want to move to another...
358	0	O'MALLEY "Martha, may I -- Martha, may I..."
359	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
360	0	RADDATZ "No, no, not yet, Governor O'Malley."
361	0	O'MALLEY Can I share this quick story?
362	0	RADDATZ "No, not yet, Governor O'Malley."
363	0	O'MALLEY Oh.
364	0	O'MALLEY All right.
365	0	RADDATZ I'll come to you when we call on you.
366	0	RADDATZ Thank you very much.
367	0	O'MALLEY "When you come back to me, I'll share that story."
368	0	RADDATZ You'll be happy.
369	0	RADDATZ I'll let -- I'll let you talk then.
370	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks, encryption."
371	0	RADDATZ "FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order."
372	0	RADDATZ "You've talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data."
373	0	RADDATZ So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?
374	0	CLINTON I would not want to go to that point.
375	0	CLINTON "I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners."
376	0	CLINTON It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.
377	0	CLINTON There must be some way.
378	0	CLINTON "I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts."
379	0	CLINTON "And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that."
380	0	CLINTON "But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something."
381	0	CLINTON "I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out."
382	0	CLINTON "Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after."
383	0	CLINTON "So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe."
384	0	CLINTON "And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve."
385	0	RADDATZ "And Governor O'Malley, where do you draw the line between national security and personal security?"
386	0	O'MALLEY I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.
387	0	O'MALLEY We need to figure this out together.
388	0	O'MALLEY We need a collaborative approach.
389	0	O'MALLEY We need new leadership.
390	0	O'MALLEY The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.
391	0	O'MALLEY The federal government should have to get warrants.
392	0	O'MALLEY "That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms."
393	0	O'MALLEY But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.
394	0	O'MALLEY "My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves."
395	0	O'MALLEY He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.
396	0	O'MALLEY And he is a proud American Muslim.
397	0	O'MALLEY "And one of his little boys said to him, ""Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?"""
398	0	O'MALLEY "These are very, very real issues."
399	0	O'MALLEY Тhis is a clear and present danger in our politics within.
400	0	O'MALLEY "We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression."
401	0	O'MALLEY And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.
402	0	RADDATZ "Thank you, Governor O'Malley."
403	0	MUIR "Martha, we're going to turn now to refugees coming to America."
404	0	MUIR "And on the subject of refugees, more than half of all Americans now say they oppose taking in refugees from Syria and across the Middle East."
405	0	MUIR "Secretary Clinton, you have said that it would undermine who we are as Americans, shutting our doors."
406	0	MUIR "But New Hampshire's governor, where we are right here tonight, a democrat and a supporter of yours, is among more than 30 governors who are now concerned."
407	0	MUIR "Governor Maggie Hassan says, ""we should halt acceptance of Syrian refugees until U.S. authorities can assure the vetting process, halt Syrian refugees."""
408	0	MUIR Is she wrong?
409	0	CLINTON "Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting..."
410	0	MUIR But a halt?
411	0	CLINTON I don't think a halt is necessary.
412	0	CLINTON "What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening."
413	0	CLINTON "Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years."
414	0	CLINTON So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.
415	0	CLINTON "But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible."
416	0	CLINTON "Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values."
417	0	CLINTON We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.
418	0	CLINTON So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.
419	0	CLINTON "And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go."
420	0	CLINTON I would prioritize them.
421	0	CLINTON And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.
422	0	MUIR "Governor O'Malley, obviously you were governor yourself at one time."
423	0	MUIR What would you say to New Hampshire's governor tonight?
424	0	MUIR Is she wrong on this?
425	0	O'MALLEY "No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept."
426	0	O'MALLEY "And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more."
427	0	MUIR So the idea of a halt or a pause?
428	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
429	0	O'MALLEY "David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees."
430	0	O'MALLEY "I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months."
431	0	O'MALLEY There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.
432	0	O'MALLEY We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.
433	0	O'MALLEY "What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now."
434	0	O'MALLEY "The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators."
435	0	O'MALLEY "We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values."
436	0	MUIR "Governor, thank you."
437	0	RADDATZ "Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, we're going to move on."
438	0	RADDATZ We're going to move on.
439	0	SANDERS Excuse me.
440	0	SANDERS May I have a chance to respond to this issue?
441	0	RADDATZ We're going to move on to the fight against ISIS.
442	0	RADDATZ You're the one who told us we have to follow the rules and break it off.
443	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
444	0	SANDERS "Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it."
445	0	SANDERS All right.
446	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
447	0	RADDATZ OK. Let's keep going.
448	0	RADDATZ Thank you.
449	0	SANDERS All right.
450	0	SANDERS Let's keep going.
451	0	SANDERS OK.
452	0	RADDATZ Thank you.
453	0	RADDATZ I do want to move to the fight against ISIS.
454	0	SANDERS Yeah.
455	0	RADDATZ "For the people of New Hampshire, the brutality of ISIS is personal."
456	0	RADDATZ James Foley grew up here.
457	0	RADDATZ "The first hostage, a journalist, brutally executed last year."
458	0	RADDATZ You've all said ISIS is a ruthless enemy and must be stopped.
459	0	RADDATZ Al Qaida as well.
460	0	RADDATZ "Senator Sanders, you voted to send U.S. ground forces to fight in the coalition to help destroy Al Qaida in Afghanistan."
461	0	RADDATZ Can you then explain you why don't support sending U.S. combat troops to join a coalition to fight ISIS?
462	0	SANDERS "And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country."
463	0	SANDERS "I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war."
464	0	SANDERS "And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops."
465	0	SANDERS And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.
466	0	RADDATZ "But why Al Qaida, why not ISIS?"
467	0	SANDERS "I have a problem with that, Martha."
468	0	SANDERS "What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort."
469	0	SANDERS "But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah."
470	0	SANDERS This is a war for the soul of Islam.
471	0	SANDERS The troops on the ground should not be American troops.
472	0	SANDERS They should be Muslim troops.
473	0	SANDERS "I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support."
474	0	RADDATZ The administration has tried that over and over again.
475	0	RADDATZ "If it doesn't work and this threat is so great, what's your plan B?"
476	0	SANDERS "My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS."
477	0	SANDERS "To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep."
478	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
479	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, you too have ruled out a large U.S. combat force, yet you support sending in special operations forces to Syria, and sending those 100 to 200 troops to Iraq to do exploitation kill raids."
480	0	RADDATZ We've already lost one Delta Force member in a raid.
481	0	RADDATZ It has looked very much to me like we're already in ground combat on frequent trips I've made there.
482	0	RADDATZ "So, are you fooling Americans when you say, we're not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq?"
483	0	CLINTON No.
484	0	CLINTON Not at all.
485	0	CLINTON I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.
486	0	CLINTON It was a different situation in Afghanistan.
487	0	CLINTON We were attacked from Afghanistan.
488	0	CLINTON Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.
489	0	CLINTON We went after those who had attacked us.
490	0	CLINTON "What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS."
491	0	CLINTON "And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants."
492	0	CLINTON They've advertised that.
493	0	CLINTON They want American troops back in the Middle East.
494	0	CLINTON "They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity."
495	0	CLINTON "So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS."
496	0	CLINTON And we do have to form a coalition.
497	0	CLINTON I know how hard that is.
498	0	CLINTON I have formed them.
499	0	CLINTON "I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran."
500	0	CLINTON And you have to really work hard at it.
501	0	CLINTON "And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition."
502	0	CLINTON And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.
503	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
504	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, I want -- I want to follow up on that."
505	0	RADDATZ You do support sending special operations forces there.
506	0	RADDATZ You support what the president has done already.
507	0	RADDATZ One of the lessons people draw from Vietnam and war since is that a little force can turn into a little more and a little more.
508	0	RADDATZ "President Obama certainly didn't expect to be sending 30,000 additional troops into Afghanistan the first year of his presidency."
509	0	RADDATZ "Are you prepared to run the risk of a bigger war to achieve your goals to destroy ISIS, or are you prepared to give up on those goals if it requires a larger force?"
510	0	CLINTON "Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice."
511	0	CLINTON "I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS."
512	0	CLINTON "So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president."
513	0	RADDATZ Governor O'Malley.
514	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
515	0	RADDATZ You've emphasized the need for more human intelligence on the ground.
516	0	RADDATZ What is it our intelligence community is not doing now that needs to be done?
517	0	O'MALLEY "Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground."
518	0	O'MALLEY "And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence."
519	0	O'MALLEY "I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward."
520	0	O'MALLEY "So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this."
521	0	O'MALLEY "As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member."
522	0	O'MALLEY "We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said."
523	0	O'MALLEY "And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat."
524	0	O'MALLEY "They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq."
525	0	O'MALLEY "We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail."
526	0	O'MALLEY And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.
527	0	O'MALLEY We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.
528	0	O'MALLEY So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.
529	0	CLINTON "Well, I just want to quickly add..."
530	0	RADDATZ Thank you.
531	0	CLINTON "Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS."
532	0	CLINTON "And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space."
533	0	CLINTON "I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition."
534	0	CLINTON A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.
535	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, I'd like to go back to that if I could."
536	0	RADDATZ "ISIS doesn't have aircraft, Al Qaida doesn't have aircraft."
537	0	RADDATZ So would you shoot down a Syrian military aircraft or a Russian airplane?
538	0	CLINTON I do not think it would come to that.
539	0	CLINTON We are already de-conflicting air space.
540	0	CLINTON We know...
541	0	RADDATZ "But isn't that a decision you should make now, whether..."
542	0	CLINTON "No, I don't think so."
543	0	CLINTON I am advocating...
544	0	RADDATZ ... if you're advocating this?
545	0	CLINTON I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.
546	0	CLINTON "Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations."
547	0	CLINTON "The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia."
548	0	CLINTON "If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs."
549	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
550	0	MUIR "I want to take this to Senator -- I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders next, because I think there..."
551	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
552	0	SANDERS I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.
553	0	SANDERS Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.
554	0	SANDERS We disagreed on the war in Iraq.
555	0	SANDERS We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.
556	0	SANDERS I voted against the war.
557	0	SANDERS But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.
558	0	SANDERS "Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region."
559	0	SANDERS "Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS."
560	0	SANDERS "Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS."
561	0	SANDERS "So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy."
562	0	SANDERS "But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after."
563	0	SANDERS "And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator."
564	0	SANDERS But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.
565	0	SANDERS That's the secondary issue.
566	0	CLINTON That is exactly...
567	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
568	0	CLINTON That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.
569	0	MUIR "Yeah, but, Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton..."
570	0	CLINTON "And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that."
571	0	CLINTON "And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya."
572	0	CLINTON "You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution."
573	0	CLINTON All of these are very difficult issues.
574	0	CLINTON I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.
575	0	CLINTON "And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned."
576	0	CLINTON "But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria."
577	0	CLINTON Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.
578	0	SANDERS I was not the secretary of state...
579	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, hold on."
580	0	MUIR "One moment, please."
581	0	MUIR "I'm going to ask the secretary here, because there does appear to be some daylight here between the policies, at least in respect to when you take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad."
582	0	MUIR Right now or do you wait?
583	0	MUIR Do you tackle ISIS first?
584	0	MUIR "You have said, Secretary Clinton, that you come to the conclusion that we have to proceed on both fronts at once."
585	0	MUIR "We heard from the senator just this week that we must put aside the issue of how quickly we get rid of Assad and come together with countries, including Russia and Iran, to destroy ISIS first."
586	0	MUIR Is he wrong?
587	0	CLINTON I think we're missing the point here.
588	0	CLINTON We are doing both at the same time.
589	0	MUIR "But that's what he's saying, we should put that aside for now and go after ISIS."
590	0	CLINTON "Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing."
591	0	CLINTON We now have that.
592	0	CLINTON We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.
593	0	CLINTON It's very important we operate on both at the same time.
594	0	CLINTON "And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this."
595	0	CLINTON I know how hard it is to build coalitions.
596	0	CLINTON I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.
597	0	CLINTON That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.
598	0	CLINTON "The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future."
599	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
600	0	SANDERS I happen to think...
601	0	O'MALLEY I'd like to offer a...
602	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
603	0	MUIR She says we have to proceed on both fronts at once.
604	0	SANDERS Secretary Clinton is right.
605	0	SANDERS This is a complicated issue.
606	0	SANDERS I don't think anyone has a magical solution.
607	0	SANDERS But this is what I do believe.
608	0	SANDERS "Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator."
609	0	SANDERS But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.
610	0	SANDERS The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.
611	0	SANDERS It is ISIS.
612	0	SANDERS And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.
613	0	SANDERS "The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS."
614	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
615	0	SANDERS "And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS."
616	0	SANDERS "And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections."
617	0	SANDERS "First priority, destroy ISIS."
618	0	MUIR "Senator sanders, thank you."
619	0	O'MALLEY May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?
620	0	MUIR Governor O'Malley?
621	0	O'MALLEY "During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey."
622	0	O'MALLEY "We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States."
623	0	O'MALLEY Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.
624	0	O'MALLEY And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.
625	0	O'MALLEY "I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves."
626	0	O'MALLEY "I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart."
627	0	O'MALLEY "And the world, no doubt is a better place without him."
628	0	O'MALLEY "But look, we didn't know what was happening next."
629	0	O'MALLEY "And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go."
630	0	O'MALLEY We have a role to play in this world.
631	0	O'MALLEY But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.
632	0	MUIR But -- you criticized -- you criticized Secretary Clinton for what came next.
633	0	MUIR What's your proposal for what comes after Assad?
634	0	O'MALLEY I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.
635	0	O'MALLEY That is the clear and present danger.
636	0	O'MALLEY "And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process."
637	0	O'MALLEY But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.
638	0	O'MALLEY "Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?"
639	0	O'MALLEY We have a role to play in this world.
640	0	O'MALLEY But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.
641	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
642	0	SANDERS David...
643	0	CLINTON Since he has been making all kinds of comments.
644	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
645	0	CLINTON "I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians."
646	0	CLINTON "The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad."
647	0	CLINTON "I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now."
648	0	CLINTON "And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or."
649	0	CLINTON "I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute."
650	0	CLINTON No.
651	0	CLINTON We now finally are where we need to be.
652	0	CLINTON "We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region..."
653	0	SANDERS Secretary...
654	0	CLINTON And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.
655	0	SANDERS Could I just say -- just say this...
656	0	CLINTON "If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader."
657	0	CLINTON There is a vacuum.
658	0	SANDERS Can I just say this...
659	0	CLINTON "And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful."
660	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
661	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, please."
662	0	MUIR Go ahead.
663	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, a last word on this."
664	0	SANDERS Of course the United States must lead.
665	0	SANDERS But the United States is not the policeman of the world.
666	0	SANDERS The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.
667	0	SANDERS "The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS."
668	0	SANDERS "ISIS, now, is the major priority."
669	0	SANDERS Let's get rid of Assad later.
670	0	SANDERS Let's have a Democratic Syria.
671	0	SANDERS But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.
672	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, thank you."
673	0	SANDERS "When we come back here tonight, the other major issues of this election: jobs, the economy, health care."
674	0	SANDERS "Which candidates will make the best case for the middle class, as our coverage of the Democratic debate, here in New Hampshire, continues right after this on ABC."
675	0	SYSTEM ABC News coverage of the New Hampshire Democratic debate will continue in a moment.
676	0	SYSTEM (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
677	0	MUIR Welcome back tonight.
678	0	MUIR "As you can see, we have a packed audience here in New Hampshire and we're going to continue."
679	0	MUIR "We've already had a spirited conversation here at the top of the broadcast about ISIS, about the concerns of terror here on the homefront and as we await Secretary Clinton backstage, we're going to begin on the economy."
680	0	MUIR "We want to turn to the American jobs, wages and raises in this country."
681	0	MUIR And we believe Secretary Clinton will be coming around the corner any minute.
682	0	MUIR But in the mean time we want to start with this eye-opening number.
683	0	MUIR "And Senator Sanders, this question goes to you first, anyway."
684	0	MUIR "In 1995, the median American household income was $52,600 in today's money."
685	0	MUIR "This year, it's $53,600."
686	0	MUIR That's 20 more years on the job with just a 2 percent raise.
687	0	MUIR "In a similar time-frame, raises for CEOs went up more than 200 percent."
688	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
689	0	CLINTON Sorry.
690	0	MUIR "We're going to continue here, and Secretary, you'll get a chance on this too."
691	0	MUIR "But as I pointed out the CEO pay, 200 percent of their time -- for that family of just 2 percent."
692	0	MUIR "You've all said, ""you would raise the minimum wage."""
693	0	MUIR But Senator Sanders what else - speak to that household tonight.
694	0	MUIR "20 years, just a 2 percent raise, how as president would you get them a raise right away?"
695	0	SANDERS "First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated."
696	0	SANDERS Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?
697	0	SANDERS Absolutely.
698	0	SANDERS "But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids."
699	0	SANDERS So what do we do?
700	0	SANDERS "First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, ""they cannot have it all."""
701	0	SANDERS "For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes."
702	0	SANDERS "Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years."
703	0	SANDERS "Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers."
704	0	SANDERS Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.
705	0	SANDERS "Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts."
706	0	SANDERS "We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment."
707	0	SANDERS "Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world."
708	0	SANDERS That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.
709	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, thank you."
710	0	MUIR "Governor O'Malley, what would propose that would be different, how would you get the middle class a raise and without waiting another 20 years for another 2 percent."
711	0	O'MALLEY Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.
712	0	O'MALLEY We actually passed a living wage.
713	0	O'MALLEY We raised the minimum wage.
714	0	O'MALLEY "We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state."
715	0	O'MALLEY "All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families."
716	0	O'MALLEY How?
717	0	O'MALLEY By actually doing more for education.
718	0	O'MALLEY We increased education funding by 37 percent.
719	0	O'MALLEY We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.
720	0	O'MALLEY We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.
721	0	O'MALLEY "We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices."
722	0	O'MALLEY "So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there."
723	0	O'MALLEY "We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families."
724	0	O'MALLEY Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.
725	0	O'MALLEY And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.
726	0	MUIR "Governor, thank you."
727	0	MUIR Secretary Clinton...
728	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
729	0	MUIR "As you were walking in, I was talking about the median American household getting a two percent raise over the last 20 years, that CEO pay in that same time frame has gone up 200 percent."
730	0	MUIR "So for those families watching tonight, how do you get them a raise if you're president?"
731	0	CLINTON "Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy."
732	0	CLINTON "It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences."
733	0	CLINTON "I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president."
734	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
735	1	CLINTON "They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes."
736	0	CLINTON "At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up."
737	0	CLINTON Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.
738	0	CLINTON "Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits."
739	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
740	0	CLINTON And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.
741	0	CLINTON That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.
742	0	CLINTON "That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities."
743	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
744	0	CLINTON And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.
745	0	CLINTON "I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down."
746	0	CLINTON I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.
747	0	CLINTON And there's a lot.
748	0	CLINTON You can go to my website...
749	0	MUIR Secretary...
750	0	CLINTON "... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it."
751	0	CLINTON But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.
752	0	MUIR "Secretary, thank you."
753	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
754	0	CLINTON This is the election...
755	0	MUIR We're going to -- we're going to...
756	0	CLINTON ... issues they have to respond to.
757	0	MUIR And we're going to talk about college education in a moment.
758	0	MUIR "But Secretary Clinton, I did want to ask you, the last time you ran for president, Fortune Magazine put you on its cover with the headline Business Loves Hillary, pointing out your support for many CEOs in corporate America."
759	0	MUIR "I'm curious, eight years later, should corporate America love Hillary Clinton?"
760	0	CLINTON Everybody should.
761	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
762	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
763	0	CLINTON "Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful."
764	0	CLINTON "I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing."
765	0	CLINTON "I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases."
766	0	CLINTON I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.
767	0	CLINTON But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.
768	0	CLINTON I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.
769	0	CLINTON "My dad was a small businessman, a really small business."
770	0	CLINTON I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.
771	0	CLINTON "So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had."
772	0	MUIR "Secretary, thank you."
773	0	MUIR Senator Sanders...
774	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
775	0	MUIR I want to stay on this and ask you how big a role does corporate America play in a healthy economy and will corporate America love a President Sanders?
776	0	SANDERS "No, I think they won't."
777	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
778	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
779	0	SANDERS So Hillary and I have a difference.
780	0	SANDERS The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.
781	0	SANDERS They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.
782	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
783	0	SANDERS "And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street."
784	0	SANDERS "When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up."
785	0	SANDERS So I don't think...
786	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
787	0	SANDERS "... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street."
788	0	SANDERS I don't have a super PAC.
789	0	SANDERS I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.
790	0	SANDERS "And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans."
791	0	SANDERS "We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen."
792	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
793	0	MUIR I want to...
794	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
795	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
796	0	MUIR "Governor, let me just ask you, though, because it is an important question, how important a role do you think corporate America plays in a healthy economy here in the U.S.?"
797	0	O'MALLEY "Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem."
798	0	O'MALLEY "And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow."
799	0	O'MALLEY "And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that."
800	0	O'MALLEY But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.
801	0	O'MALLEY "We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism."
802	0	O'MALLEY "And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has."
803	0	O'MALLEY "In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11."
804	0	O'MALLEY I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.
805	0	O'MALLEY There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.
806	1	O'MALLEY "And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot."
807	0	O'MALLEY "And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes."
808	0	O'MALLEY "And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors..."
809	0	CLINTON OK...
810	0	MUIR "Governor O'Malley, thank you."
811	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
812	0	MUIR "I do want to ask you, Secretary Clinton."
813	0	MUIR Let me just ask you...
814	0	CLINTON Let me respond...
815	0	MUIR "We did -- we did -- Secretary Clinton, let me just ask you..."
816	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
817	0	CLINTON "Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly."
818	0	CLINTON Number one...
819	0	MUIR And in particular...
820	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
821	0	CLINTON "Number one, there are currently two hedge fund billionaires running ads against me here in New Hampshire."
822	0	CLINTON They started in Iowa.
823	0	CLINTON "Now, you'd have to ask yourself, why are they running ads against me?"
824	0	CLINTON "And the answer is: Because they know I will go right after them, that I will not let their agenda be America's agenda."
825	1	CLINTON "Secondly, I think it's important to point out that about 3 percent of my donations come from people in the finance and investment world."
826	0	CLINTON You can go to opensecrets.org and check that.
827	1	CLINTON I have more donations from students and teachers than I do from people associated with Wall Street.
828	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
829	0	CLINTON "Now, number three -- and let me say this -- when Governor O'Malley was heading the Democratic Governors Association, he had no trouble at all going to Wall Street to raise money to run campaigns for Democratic governors."
830	0	CLINTON And he also had no trouble appointing an investment banker to be in charge of his consumer protection bureau when he was governor.
831	0	CLINTON "So, you know, again, the difference between us and the Republicans is night and day."
832	0	CLINTON "And there is only one person on this stage who voted to take away authority from the SEC and the Commodities Future Trading Commission that they could no longer regulate what are called swaps and derivatives, which actually contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and that was Senator Sanders."
833	0	CLINTON "So if we're going to be talking like this, we can -- and maybe we can score some political points -- but the fact is: Every one of us stands for the kind of economy that will work better for every American."
834	0	CLINTON "And if that means taking on Wall Street, I have a plan that is tough and comprehensive and praised by a lot of folks who say it goes further than what both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley are proposing."
835	0	SANDERS Let me just -- let me just...
836	0	MUIR "Secretary Clinton, thank you."
837	0	SANDERS Let me just jump in.
838	0	SANDERS My name was invoked.
839	0	MUIR Senator?
840	0	SANDERS "So with that invocation, let me say a few words."
841	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
842	0	SANDERS "Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC."
843	0	SANDERS I don't get any money from Wall Street.
844	0	SANDERS You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street.
845	0	SANDERS "But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com."
846	0	SANDERS I'll advertise my Web site as well.
847	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
848	0	SANDERS "And what you'll find is that I led -- helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton, maybe you know him, maybe you don't."
849	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
850	0	SANDERS "Against the Republican leadership, who all thought it would be a great idea to merge investor banks and commercial banks and large insurance companies."
851	0	SANDERS What a brilliant idea that would be.
852	0	SANDERS Go to YouTube.
853	0	SANDERS Find out what I said to Greenspan.
854	0	SANDERS "At the end of the day, if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, and the governor makes a good point about trade, anti-trade, anti-monopoly activities."
855	0	SANDERS Wall Street today has too much political power.
856	0	SANDERS It has too much economic power.
857	0	SANDERS "To get deregulated -- listen to this, they spent $5 billion in lobbying and campaign contributions over a 10-year period."
858	0	MUIR Senator Sanders...
859	0	SANDERS Wall Street is a threat to the economy.
860	0	SANDERS They've got to be broken up.
861	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
862	0	MUIR "Thank you, Senator."
863	0	RADDATZ And we're going to move on to health care.
864	0	SANDERS "Secretary Clinton, the Department of Health and Human Services says more than 17 million Americans who are not insured now have health coverage because of Obamacare."
865	0	SANDERS "But for Americans who already had health insurance the cost has gone up 27 percent in the last five years while deductibles are up 67 percent, health care costs are rising faster than many Americans can manage."
866	0	SANDERS What's broken in Obamacare that needs to be fixed right now?
867	0	SANDERS And what would you do to fix it?
868	0	CLINTON "Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced."
869	0	CLINTON "Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care."
870	0	CLINTON We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.
871	0	CLINTON Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.
872	0	CLINTON And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.
873	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
874	0	CLINTON Those are all really positive developments.
875	0	CLINTON But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.
876	0	CLINTON "And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those."
877	0	CLINTON "Number two, I want Medicare to be able to negotiate for lower drug prices just like they negotiate with other countries' health systems."
878	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
879	0	CLINTON We end up paying the highest prices in the world.
880	0	CLINTON And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.
881	0	CLINTON "And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha."
882	0	CLINTON We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.
883	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
884	0	RADDATZ But you did say those were glitches.
885	0	CLINTON Yes.
886	0	RADDATZ Just glitches?
887	0	CLINTON "Well, they're glitches because..."
888	0	RADDATZ "Twenty-seven percent in the last five years, deductibles up 67 percent?"
889	0	CLINTON It is.
890	0	CLINTON Because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing.
891	0	CLINTON "We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan."
892	0	CLINTON I know.
893	0	CLINTON I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.
894	0	CLINTON We want to build on it and fix it.
895	0	CLINTON And I'm confident we can do that.
896	0	CLINTON And it will have effects in the private market.
897	0	CLINTON And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.
898	0	CLINTON "And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals."
899	0	CLINTON "Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system."
900	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
901	0	RADDATZ "Senator Sanders, I want you to respond to what she was saying, but you're instead calling for single-payer health care."
902	0	SANDERS "Yes, exactly, exactly."
903	0	RADDATZ You note people won't have to pay deductibles or premiums but they will have to pay new taxes.
904	0	RADDATZ Can you tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay?
905	0	SANDERS "Yes, well, roughly."
906	0	SANDERS Let me say this.
907	0	SANDERS "As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward."
908	0	SANDERS Seventeen more million more people have health care.
909	0	SANDERS It is a step forward.
910	0	SANDERS A step forward.
911	0	SANDERS But this is what we also have to say.
912	0	SANDERS "Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor."
913	0	SANDERS Major crisis and primary health care.
914	0	SANDERS Here is the bottom line.
915	0	SANDERS Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?
916	0	SANDERS Why is it...
917	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
918	0	SANDERS "Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes."
919	0	SANDERS Bottom line.
920	0	SANDERS This ties into campaign finance reform.
921	0	SANDERS "The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress."
922	0	SANDERS We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.
923	0	SANDERS It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.
924	0	RADDATZ "Senator Sanders, you didn't really tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay..."
925	0	SANDERS "But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance."
926	0	SANDERS So it's unfair to say in total...
927	0	RADDATZ "But you can't tell us this specifically, even if you were..."
928	0	SANDERS "I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance."
929	0	SANDERS The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.
930	0	RADDATZ OK.
931	0	RADDATZ "Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque."
932	0	RADDATZ Neil?
933	0	LEVESQUE Here to New Hampshire again.
934	0	LEVESQUE "As you know, this auditorium is filled with many Saint Anselm college students."
935	0	LEVESQUE They know the outstanding student debt right now in America is $1.3 trillion.
936	0	LEVESQUE "That private education costs have gone up in the last decade 26 percent, and 40 percent for public education."
937	0	LEVESQUE "So knowing that, we know you want to make public education more affordable but how do you really lower the cost?"
938	0	LEVESQUE "Senator Sanders, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you want free tuition for public colleges."
939	0	SANDERS And universities.
940	0	LEVESQUE How does that really lower the cost other than just shifting the cost to taxpayers?
941	0	SANDERS "Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach."
942	0	SANDERS And your point is absolutely well taken.
943	0	SANDERS The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.
944	0	SANDERS There are a lot of factors involved in that.
945	0	SANDERS And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.
946	0	SANDERS Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.
947	0	SANDERS But...
948	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
949	0	SANDERS And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.
950	0	SANDERS "But, bottom line is this is the year 2015."
951	0	SANDERS If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.
952	0	SANDERS "It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them."
953	0	SANDERS "Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt."
954	0	SANDERS What do we do?
955	0	SANDERS "My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt."
956	0	SANDERS "You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent."
957	0	SANDERS What sense is that?
958	0	SANDERS So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.
959	0	SANDERS We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.
960	0	SANDERS All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.
961	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
962	0	LEVESQUE "Governor O'Malley, how do you propose -- Governor O'Malley, how do you propose lowering some of these costs associated with higher education?"
963	0	O'MALLEY "Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this."
964	0	O'MALLEY As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.
965	0	O'MALLEY My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.
966	0	O'MALLEY So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.
967	0	O'MALLEY "Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance."
968	0	O'MALLEY But states need to do more as well.
969	0	O'MALLEY And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.
970	0	O'MALLEY I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.
971	0	O'MALLEY "I'm joined tonight by two daughters, Tara and Grace."
972	0	O'MALLEY My oldest daughter's a teacher.
973	0	O'MALLEY "Man (ph), their mother's here as well."
974	0	O'MALLEY "We were proud of them on graduation day, weren't we, Katie?"
975	0	O'MALLEY And we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives.
976	0	O'MALLEY "I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones."
977	0	O'MALLEY There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.
978	0	O'MALLEY I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.
979	0	O'MALLEY Bill.
980	0	O'MALLEY "But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills."
981	0	O'MALLEY That's a drag on the economy.
982	0	O'MALLEY It's one of the key investments we need to make.
983	0	O'MALLEY I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.
984	0	O'MALLEY "And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid."
985	0	MUIR Secretary Clinton.
986	0	CLINTON Right.
987	0	MCELVEEN "Secretary Clinton, how does your plan differentiate from your opponents?"
988	0	CLINTON "Well, I have what I call the new college compact."
989	0	CLINTON "Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know."
990	0	CLINTON "Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education."
991	0	CLINTON "In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country."
992	0	CLINTON "So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education."
993	0	CLINTON "So under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system."
994	0	CLINTON "Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody."
995	0	CLINTON "I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead."
996	0	CLINTON "So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense."
997	0	CLINTON "So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response."
998	0	CLINTON "But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems."
999	0	CLINTON "Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget."
1000	0	CLINTON "And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run."
1001	0	CLINTON "And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college."
1002	0	MCELVEEN "Thank you Secretary Clinton, thank you."
1003	0	SANDERS May I respond to the critique on the ...
1004	0	MCELVEEN Back to you David.
1005	0	MUIR We're going to get right into this Senator but I want to ask about taxes next.
1006	0	MUIR This is included.
1007	0	SANDERS I would just...
1008	0	MUIR She was asking about that...
1009	0	SANDERS But Secretary Clinton is wrong.
1010	0	SANDERS "As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care."
1011	0	SANDERS You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.
1012	0	SANDERS "And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal."
1013	0	CLINTON "Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders..."
1014	0	MUIR Are we back on health care - Secretary Clinton hold one moment.
1015	0	MUIR Senator Sanders...
1016	0	SYSTEM (CROSSTALK)
1017	0	CLINTON Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.
1018	0	MUIR "Secretary Clinton, please."
1019	0	CLINTON "And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families."
1020	0	CLINTON I'm the only person...
1021	0	MUIR So let's ask about it.
1022	0	MUIR "Secretary Clinton, let's turn to the taxes."
1023	0	CLINTON "... saying, no middle class tax raises."
1024	0	CLINTON That's off the table...
1025	0	MUIR "This is where we are going next, we are going next to taxes here..."
1026	0	SANDERS "Now, this is getting to be fun."
1027	0	MUIR This is fun.
1028	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1029	0	MUIR This is democracy at work.
1030	0	MUIR "Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about your tax plan because from the crushing cost of college education, the next question most families have; is will my taxes go up under the next president?"
1031	0	MUIR "You have said it's your goal not to raise taxes on families making under $200,000 a year a goal."
1032	0	MUIR But can you say that's a promise as you stand here tonight?
1033	0	CLINTON That is a pledge that I'm making.
1034	0	CLINTON I made it when I ran in 2008.
1035	0	MUIR A promise?
1036	0	CLINTON "Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made."
1037	0	CLINTON Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.
1038	0	CLINTON We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.
1039	0	CLINTON "Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody."
1040	0	CLINTON "And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now."
1041	0	SANDERS Let me respond to...
1042	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1043	0	MUIR Secretary Clinton...
1044	0	SANDERS Let me respond to...
1045	0	MUIR Please.
1046	0	SANDERS "Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own."
1047	0	SANDERS "Now, when Secretary Clinton says, ""I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class,"" let me tell you what she is saying."
1048	0	SANDERS "She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave."
1049	0	SANDERS What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.
1050	0	SANDERS "Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class."
1051	0	SANDERS It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.
1052	0	SANDERS "I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest."
1053	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
1054	0	MUIR Let me bring in Governor O'Malley...
1055	0	CLINTON "Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid..."
1056	0	MUIR You've heard...
1057	0	CLINTON ... family leave for a very long time...
1058	0	MUIR Secretary Clinton.
1059	0	SANDERS "David, thank you."
1060	0	CLINTON I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...
1061	0	SANDERS Then (inaudible)...
1062	0	CLINTON ... not everybody else.
1063	0	SANDERS "Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave."
1064	0	MUIR Thank you.
1065	0	MUIR I want to bring in Governor O'Malley on this.
1066	0	MUIR "We heard the promise from Secretary Clinton because people want to know about their taxes, will they go up."
1067	0	MUIR "She has now promised here tonight not to raise them on families making $250,000 or less."
1068	0	MUIR Can you make that same promise if you're elected?
1069	0	O'MALLEY "No, I've never made a promise like that."
1070	0	O'MALLEY "But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year."
1071	0	O'MALLEY I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.
1072	0	O'MALLEY "By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started."
1073	0	O'MALLEY But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.
1074	0	O'MALLEY "David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave."
1075	0	O'MALLEY And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.
1076	0	O'MALLEY "And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits."
1077	0	O'MALLEY "But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains."
1078	0	O'MALLEY "If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again."
1079	0	O'MALLEY So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.
1080	0	O'MALLEY "That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how."
1081	0	MUIR "Governor O'Malley, thank you."
1082	0	MUIR A spirited debate on taxes.
1083	0	MUIR "And there will be more with the Democratic debate in New Hampshire, when we come back right here on ABC."
1084	0	MUIR More in a moment.

1088	0	MUIR "And Secretary Clinton, we want to turn to race, now, in America."
1089	0	MUIR "There is a real concern in this country from Black Lives Matter and from other community groups that we're just now seeing, with smartphones and cell phones, what many have been dealing with for years when they come in contact with police."
1090	0	MUIR "But you also have many in law enforcement who now say there has been a so-called Ferguson effect, police holding back because they're afraid of backlash."
1091	0	MUIR "In fact, the FBI director is calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement."
1092	0	MUIR "So, if elected president, how would you bridge the divide between the two?"
1093	0	CLINTON "Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country."
1094	0	CLINTON "We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended."
1095	0	CLINTON I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.
1096	0	CLINTON Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.
1097	0	CLINTON "At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically."
1098	0	CLINTON The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.
1099	0	CLINTON The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.
1100	0	CLINTON So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.
1101	0	CLINTON We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.
1102	0	CLINTON "And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust."
1103	0	MUIR "Secretary, thank you."
1104	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1105	0	MUIR "Governor O'Malley, how would you bridge the divide?"
1106	0	O'MALLEY "There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America."
1107	0	O'MALLEY "When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America."
1108	0	O'MALLEY But we came together.
1109	0	O'MALLEY I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.
1110	0	O'MALLEY And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.
1111	0	O'MALLEY "As governor, we continued to work together."
1112	0	O'MALLEY We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.
1113	0	O'MALLEY But get this.
1114	0	O'MALLEY We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.
1115	0	O'MALLEY "So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police."
1116	0	O'MALLEY But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.
1117	0	O'MALLEY "We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force."
1118	0	O'MALLEY "In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force."
1119	0	O'MALLEY "As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable."
1120	0	O'MALLEY "Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force."
1121	0	O'MALLEY "There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better."
1122	0	O'MALLEY We need to do it now as a nation.
1123	0	O'MALLEY This is our time and our opportunity to do that.
1124	0	MUIR "Governor, thank you."
1125	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1126	0	MUIR "And Senator Sanders, when you hear the FBI director calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement, does that concern you as well when you --"
1127	0	SANDERS "Well, this whole issue concerns me."
1128	0	SANDERS And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.
1129	0	SANDERS But let's be clear.
1130	0	SANDERS "Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people."
1131	0	SANDERS Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.
1132	0	SANDERS We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.
1133	0	SANDERS "I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism."
1134	0	SANDERS "We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system."
1135	0	SANDERS "Now, what does that mean?"
1136	0	SANDERS "Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans."
1137	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1138	0	SANDERS "It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act."
1139	0	SANDERS So that it will not be a federal crime.
1140	0	SANDERS That is why we need to make...
1141	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1142	0	SANDERS That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.
1143	0	SANDERS "I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department."
1144	0	SANDERS "And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force."
1145	0	SANDERS We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.
1146	0	SANDERS We need to end minimal sentencing.
1147	0	SANDERS "We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration."
1148	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1149	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
1150	0	MUIR We want to turn now to an issue.
1151	0	MUIR "This next issue has destroyed so many families across the country, and in particular right here in New Hampshire, heroin."
1152	0	MUIR And there's a stunning new figure out.
1153	0	MUIR "A recent poll -- 48 percent here, in this state alone, say they know someone who has abused heroin."
1154	0	MUIR We're going to turn tonight to Dan Tuohy of the New Hampshire Union Leader who has this question.
1155	0	QUESTION "New Hampshire has been hard hit by the heroin epidemic, and we're on track to have twice as many overdose deaths this year as in 2013."
1156	0	QUESTION What specifically would you do to address this crisis?
1157	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, I'm going to take this to you first because you've seen what's happened with heroin right on the border in your own state."
1158	0	SANDERS Yes.
1159	0	SANDERS "Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire."
1160	0	SANDERS It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.
1161	0	SANDERS It is a tragedy all over this country.
1162	0	SANDERS "The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly."
1163	0	SANDERS What do we do?
1164	0	SANDERS "Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin."
1165	0	SANDERS "Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity."
1166	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1167	0	SANDERS And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.
1168	0	SANDERS "When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help."
1169	0	SANDERS They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.
1170	0	SANDERS So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.
1171	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
1172	0	MUIR Secretary Clinton?
1173	0	CLINTON "You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?"
1174	0	CLINTON "And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose."
1175	0	CLINTON "I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities."
1176	0	CLINTON "So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard."
1177	0	CLINTON "I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do."
1178	0	CLINTON "And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out."
1179	0	CLINTON "And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena."
1180	0	CLINTON "So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together."
1181	0	CLINTON "I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan."
1182	0	CLINTON We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.
1183	0	CLINTON "There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction."
1184	0	CLINTON "And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go."
1185	0	CLINTON "And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring."
1186	0	MUIR "Secretary, thank you."
1187	0	O'MALLEY "And you know, I actually know a great deal about this issue."
1188	0	O'MALLEY "And I have a dear friend, played music with him for years, remember when his -- when he came home with his baby girl, and now she's no longer with us, because of addiction and overdose."
1189	0	O'MALLEY "The last time in New Hampshire, I had to take a break shortly after landing and call home and comfort a friend whose mother had died of an overdose."
1190	0	O'MALLEY Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.
1191	0	O'MALLEY It's a huge public health challenge.
1192	0	O'MALLEY "In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America."
1193	0	O'MALLEY "But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing."
1194	0	O'MALLEY "I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment."
1195	0	O'MALLEY "We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital."
1196	0	O'MALLEY "That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there."
1197	0	O'MALLEY That's what I said to my own public health people.
1198	0	O'MALLEY What would we do if this were ebola?
1199	0	O'MALLEY How would we act?
1200	0	O'MALLEY "So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act."
1201	0	O'MALLEY There are thing that can be done.
1202	0	O'MALLEY Go on to my website.
1203	0	O'MALLEY My plan is there.
1204	0	O'MALLEY It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.
1205	0	MUIR "Governor O'Malley, thank you."
1206	0	MUIR Martha?
1207	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1208	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, I want to circle back to something that your opponents here have brought up."
1209	0	RADDATZ Libya is falling apart.
1210	0	RADDATZ "The country is a haven for ISIS and jihadists with an estimated 2,000 ISIS fighters there today."
1211	0	RADDATZ You advocated for that 2011 intervention and called it smart power at its best.
1212	0	RADDATZ "And yet, even President Obama said the U.S. should have done more to fill the leadership vacuum left behind."
1213	0	RADDATZ How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed elections?
1214	0	CLINTON "Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people."
1215	0	CLINTON "The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi."
1216	0	CLINTON "I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path."
1217	0	CLINTON "Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do."
1218	0	CLINTON "But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government."
1219	0	CLINTON "You know, this is not easy work."
1220	0	CLINTON We did a lot to help.
1221	0	CLINTON We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.
1222	0	CLINTON But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.
1223	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, I want to go back."
1224	0	RADDATZ That -- government lacked institutions and experience.
1225	0	RADDATZ It had been a family business for 40 years.
1226	0	RADDATZ "On the security side, we offered only a modest training effort and a very limited arms buy-back program."
1227	0	RADDATZ Let me ask you the question again.
1228	0	RADDATZ How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed those elections?
1229	0	CLINTON "Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take."
1230	0	CLINTON We offered a lot more.
1231	0	CLINTON "We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up."
1232	0	CLINTON "You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first."
1233	0	CLINTON "I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country."
1234	0	CLINTON But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.
1235	0	CLINTON We've been at this a couple of years.
1236	0	RADDATZ But were mistakes made?
1237	0	CLINTON "Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made."
1238	0	CLINTON But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.
1239	0	CLINTON What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.
1240	0	SANDERS But what...
1241	0	RADDATZ Senator Sanders.
1242	0	SANDERS "Look, the secretary is right."
1243	0	SANDERS This is a terribly complicated issue.
1244	0	SANDERS There are no simple solutions.
1245	0	SANDERS "But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad."
1246	0	SANDERS The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.
1247	0	SANDERS So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.
1248	0	SANDERS I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.
1249	0	O'MALLEY Martha -- I would just repeat that --
1250	0	CLINTON "Well, I would just repeat that."
1251	0	RADDATZ Secretary Clinton.
1252	0	CLINTON Wait a minute.
1253	0	CLINTON "I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote."
1254	0	CLINTON We got a U.N. Security council vote.
1255	0	CLINTON "Now, I understand that this is very difficult."
1256	0	CLINTON And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.
1257	0	CLINTON We saw what happened in Egypt.
1258	0	CLINTON "I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship."
1259	0	CLINTON This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.
1260	0	CLINTON "One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy."
1261	0	CLINTON That's a hard road to walk.
1262	0	CLINTON But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.
1263	0	O'MALLEY And Martha...
1264	0	RADDATZ Quick Governor O'Malley.
1265	0	O'MALLEY "... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region."
1266	0	O'MALLEY And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.
1267	0	O'MALLEY We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.
1268	0	O'MALLEY That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.
1269	0	O'MALLEY "But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that."
1270	0	O'MALLEY "And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL."
1271	0	O'MALLEY They go back and forth between Syria and this region.
1272	0	O'MALLEY We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.
1273	0	RADDATZ Thank you very much.
1274	0	RADDATZ Thank you.
1275	0	RADDATZ We're going to move on here.
1276	0	RADDATZ "Governor O'Malley, thank you very much for that."
1277	0	RADDATZ And we're going to make a very sharp turn as we wrap things up here.
1278	0	RADDATZ "Secretary Clinton, first ladies, as you well know, have used their position to work on important causes like literacy and drug abuse."
1279	0	RADDATZ "But they also supervise the menus, the flowers, the holiday ornaments and White House decor."
1280	0	RADDATZ I know you think you know where I'm going here.
1281	0	RADDATZ You have said that Bill Clinton is a great host and loves giving tours but may opt out of picking flower arrangements if you're elected.
1282	0	RADDATZ "Bill Clinton aside, is it time to change the role of a president's spouse?"
1283	0	CLINTON "Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it."
1284	0	CLINTON And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.
1285	0	CLINTON "Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise."
1286	0	CLINTON And I think has had a big impact.
1287	0	CLINTON So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.
1288	0	CLINTON "And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that."
1289	0	CLINTON "But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about."
1290	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1291	0	CLINTON Democrats discuss presidential spouses.
1292	0	CLINTON "Candidates Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders talk about the roles their spouses would play in helping run the Oval Office (ABC News)."
1293	0	MUIR I do want to follow up here for each of you.
1294	0	MUIR And a similar line of questioning.
1295	0	MUIR "Senator Sanders, your wife Jane shares an office at your campaign headquarters in Burlington."
1296	0	MUIR "We've seen the pictures, the desks right next to each other."
1297	0	MUIR Would she have a desk close by in the west wing?
1298	0	SANDERS "Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would."
1299	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
1300	0	SANDERS "And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be."
1301	0	SANDERS "So, I thank you very much for that."
1302	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
1303	0	SANDERS "My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent."
1304	0	SANDERS "Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed."
1305	0	SANDERS And she turned around many lives.
1306	0	SANDERS She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.
1307	0	SANDERS "She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper."
1308	0	SANDERS We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.
1309	0	SANDERS She led that effort.
1310	0	SANDERS "So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals."
1311	0	MUIR "Senator, thank you."
1312	0	O'MALLEY "Well, that would be totally up to her."
1313	0	O'MALLEY "I mean, Katie has never been a person who let her husband's professional choices get in the way of following her dreams."
1314	0	O'MALLEY "And I think she got that from her mother, actually."
1315	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1316	0	O'MALLEY "The -- and I readily admit that she is a far more accomplished lawyer than I was ever able to become, before I took my detour."
1317	0	O'MALLEY She is a district court judge in Maryland.
1318	0	O'MALLEY She puts in a full day there.
1319	0	O'MALLEY We've raised four terrific kids.
1320	0	O'MALLEY "And yet, when she was first lady of the state, not only would she go to work every day and sit there through a lot of sad and gut-wrenching cases, but then she'd put in additional time being an advocate against domestic violence."
1321	0	O'MALLEY "Maryland made great strides on that because of her advocacy, and her understanding of how the court process works."
1322	0	O'MALLEY She was an advocate against bullying and implementing anti-bullying things.
1323	0	O'MALLEY "So Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do, regardless of her husband's success in getting elected president."
1324	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1325	0	MUIR "Governor O'Malley, thank you, (inaudible)."
1326	0	O'MALLEY Thank you.
1327	0	MUIR "Governor, thank you."
1328	0	MUIR We'll be back with much more from New Hampshire.
1329	0	MUIR The Democratic debate continues right after this.
1330	0	SYSTEM (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
1331	0	MUIR Welcome back tonight.
1332	0	MUIR It's been an evening of lively discussion among the candidates and it's time for closing statements.
1333	0	MUIR "We began in alphabetical order, so we'll reverse the order at the end and begin with you, Senator Sanders."
1334	0	SANDERS "Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here."
1335	0	SANDERS "Because I think frankly, maybe I'm wrong, but on our worst day, I think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right wing's extremists."
1336	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)

1342	0	SANDERS We were the first in the family.
1343	0	SANDERS So I know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income.

22	0	KELLY The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country.
23	0	KELLY "And for six months that -- your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel."
24	0	KELLY You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.
25	0	KELLY "But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats' bidding."
26	0	KELLY Which is it?
27	0	CRUZ "Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate."
28	0	CRUZ I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.

43	0	RUBIO He's an entertaining guy.
44	0	RUBIO He's the greatest show on earth.
45	0	RUBIO This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.
46	0	RUBIO "You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America."

79	0	BUSH And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.
80	0	BUSH "Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent."

86	0	BAIER Thank you governor.
87	0	KELLY "Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle."
88	0	KELLY "However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn't great if you get the wrong things done."
89	0	KELLY And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise.
90	0	KELLY Why are they wrong and you're right?
91	0	CHRISTIE They're not wrong.
92	0	CHRISTIE But what's wrong is your premise in the question.
93	0	CHRISTIE You can do both.
94	0	CHRISTIE "There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government."
95	0	CHRISTIE "You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them."
96	0	CHRISTIE "You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet."
97	0	CHRISTIE "He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration."
98	0	CHRISTIE He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.
99	0	CHRISTIE And who's compromised and who is principled.
100	0	CHRISTIE What he wants is something to get done.
101	0	CHRISTIE And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.
102	0	CHRISTIE Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.
103	0	CHRISTIE Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.
104	0	CHRISTIE "I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done."
105	0	CHRISTIE That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.

107	0	BAIER "Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category."
108	0	BAIER "But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul."
109	0	BAIER Senator Cruz's campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father's 2012 campaign and the liberty movement.
110	0	BAIER And your father now says it's realistic that Donald Trump will be your party's nominee.
111	0	BAIER So did you make a mistake by not fully -- more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?
112	0	PAUL "You know, I've always had a great deal of respect."
113	0	PAUL There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.
114	0	PAUL I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.
115	0	PAUL And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.
116	0	PAUL "I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted."
117	0	PAUL "You know, Ted didn't show up."
118	0	PAUL "We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up."
119	0	PAUL He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.
120	0	PAUL And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.
121	0	PAUL I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.
122	0	PAUL The NSA is another big issue.
123	0	PAUL "Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records."
124	0	PAUL I don't think Ted can have it both ways.
125	0	PAUL They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.
126	0	PAUL But we don't see it happening at all.
127	0	PAUL We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.
128	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
129	0	BAIER "Senator Cruz, your response to that?"
130	0	CRUZ "Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition."
131	0	CRUZ "You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority."
132	0	CRUZ "When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it."
133	0	CRUZ It didn't have the votes to pass.
134	0	CRUZ And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.
135	0	CRUZ But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.

137	0	BAIER Senator Rubio?
138	0	RUBIO "I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand."

140	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
141	0	RUBIO I do respect Rand.
142	0	RUBIO But I want to be frank about what I stand for.
143	0	RUBIO I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.
144	0	RUBIO "And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS."
145	0	RUBIO That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.
146	0	RUBIO And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.
147	0	RUBIO And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.
148	0	RUBIO "And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe."

155	0	BAIER "OK. Go ahead, go ahead."
156	0	PAUL "Just very quickly, I would like to respond."
157	0	PAUL "The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack."
158	0	PAUL I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.
159	0	PAUL "When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this."
160	0	PAUL Even the court declared it to be illegal.
161	0	PAUL "If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way."
162	0	PAUL Let's use the Fourth Amendment.
163	0	PAUL "Let's put a name on a warrant, let's ask a judge for it."
164	0	PAUL Let's respect the history of our country.

169	0	WALLACE "You call yourself a, quote, ""inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,"" but you reject the establishment label."
170	0	WALLACE First question is why do you reject it?
171	0	WALLACE "And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?"
172	0	KASICH "Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes."
173	0	KASICH "There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane."
174	0	KASICH "And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do."
175	1	KASICH "And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor."
176	0	KASICH "You know, the situation is this."
177	0	KASICH "We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party."
178	0	KASICH We have to come together as a country.
179	0	KASICH And we have to stop all the divisions.
180	0	KASICH "And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire."
181	0	KASICH "And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment."
182	0	KASICH And it isn't because I'm all that great.
183	0	KASICH It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.

185	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)

190	0	CARSON "Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title."
191	0	CARSON "You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth."

198	0	CARSON The American people are terrified.
199	0	CARSON That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.

207	0	WALLACE You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion.
208	0	WALLACE You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night.

218	0	CRUZ "Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military."
219	0	CRUZ "You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war."

226	0	CRUZ "Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day."
227	0	CRUZ He's not arming the Kurds.

548	0	BAIER If you were president.
549	0	BAIER would you police these charity organizations that say they're helping vets?
550	0	BUSH Of course.
551	0	BUSH "And there's all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that."
552	0	BUSH But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
553	0	BUSH That's his first responsibility.
554	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
555	0	BUSH "Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are -- that are leaving because of the sequester where we're gutting the military."
556	0	BUSH "More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows."
557	0	BUSH "They've given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care."
558	0	BUSH "People died, and only three people have been fired."
559	0	BUSH I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.
560	0	BUSH "You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result."
561	0	BUSH "And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example."
562	0	BUSH "In Houston, Texas, there's an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there's no homeless veterans in Houston."
563	0	BUSH And they've come pretty close to that without federal government assistance.
564	0	BUSH We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.

575	0	BAIER "Senator Paul, that question to you."
576	0	PAUL "You know, I've supported legislation to allow body cameras."
577	0	PAUL "I've been to Ferguson, I've been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem."
578	0	PAUL One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.
579	0	PAUL People were just being fined to death.
580	0	PAUL "Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it."
581	0	PAUL "If you're living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job."
582	0	PAUL "I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males."
583	0	PAUL "In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men."

599	0	BAIER "Thank you, Megyn."
600	0	BAIER "Gentlemen, I'll ask you some questions about federal spending and the role of the federal government."
601	0	BAIER "Everybody always said they want to cut federal spending and usually they start by saying they'll cut waste, fraud, and abuse, but that really doesn't ever materialize."
602	0	BAIER We all know that.
603	0	BAIER "Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that's where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget."

619	0	BAIER "Google Data shows that in the last month when people searched ""policy repeals,"" that there were a lot of them."
620	0	BAIER Obamacare took the top two spots.
621	0	BAIER But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.
622	0	BAIER "So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don't have health insurance?"
623	0	BAIER And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?
624	0	CRUZ Sure.
625	0	CRUZ "Well, let's take it one at a time."
626	1	CRUZ "First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster."
627	1	CRUZ It is the biggest job-killer in this country.
628	1	CRUZ "Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket."
629	0	CRUZ "If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare."
630	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
631	0	CRUZ "Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform."
632	0	CRUZ "It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors."
633	0	CRUZ Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.
634	0	CRUZ "Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines."
635	0	CRUZ "That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance."
636	0	CRUZ "Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs."
637	0	CRUZ "And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable."
638	1	CRUZ "And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt."
639	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
640	0	BAIER "Senator Cruz, thank you."
641	0	BAIER "Governor Bush, you've advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico."
642	0	BAIER The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden.
643	0	BAIER Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed.
644	0	BAIER "So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?"
645	0	BUSH "No, they shouldn't."
646	0	BUSH And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.
647	0	BUSH "If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship."
648	0	BUSH They serve in the military.
649	0	BUSH They would have to pay federal taxes.
650	0	BUSH They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.
651	0	BUSH But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.
652	0	BUSH "Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face."
653	0	BUSH "You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando."
654	0	BUSH And a lot of people are doing that.
655	0	BUSH And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.
656	0	BUSH "The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now."
657	0	BAIER "Governor Kasich, you're one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race."

661	0	KASICH "And, you know, I don't know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done."
662	0	KASICH I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.
663	0	KASICH "But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that."
664	0	KASICH "And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting."
665	0	KASICH There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.
666	0	KASICH You've got to be on top of it.
667	0	KASICH You've got to go the extra mile.
668	0	KASICH You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.
669	0	KASICH Because you realize that people depending on you.
670	0	KASICH "And so, you go the extra mile."
671	0	KASICH But people have to be alert.
672	0	KASICH They have to be alert to problems.
673	0	KASICH "And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it."
674	0	KASICH "And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them."
675	0	KASICH "Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct."
676	0	KASICH So the fact is that we work for the people.
677	0	KASICH The people don't work for us.
678	0	KASICH And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.
679	0	KASICH That's what really matters.
680	0	KASICH We serve you.

684	0	BAIER "Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy."
685	0	BAIER "Now, you're a skeptic of climate change science."
686	0	BAIER "And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy."
687	0	BAIER So why the change?
688	0	RUBIO "Well, Bret, first that's not entirely the story."
689	0	RUBIO "At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican -- his name was Charlie Crist -- he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida."
690	0	RUBIO And I opposed it.
691	0	RUBIO I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.
692	0	RUBIO "And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it."
693	0	RUBIO "And what we said is, if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it."
694	0	RUBIO But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea.
695	0	RUBIO And I was clear about that at the time.
696	0	RUBIO And I do not believe it's a good idea now.
697	0	RUBIO I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.
698	0	RUBIO "And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy."

735	1	RUBIO I do not support amnesty...
736	0	KELLY "... You said more than that, Senator..."
737	1	RUBIO "... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty..."
738	1	KELLY ... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.
739	0	KELLY You...
740	0	RUBIO It was...
741	0	KELLY ... supported earned path to citizenship...
742	1	RUBIO "It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate."
743	0	RUBIO It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.
744	0	RUBIO What I've always said is that this issue does need to be solved.
745	0	RUBIO "They've been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens."
746	0	RUBIO "And, I'm going to tell you exactly how we're going to deal with it when I am president."
747	0	RUBIO "Number one, we're going to keep ISIS out of America."
748	0	RUBIO "If we don't know who you are, or why you're coming, you will not get into the United States."
749	0	RUBIO "Number two, we're going to enforce our immigration laws."
750	0	RUBIO I am the son and grandson of immigrants.
751	0	RUBIO And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.
752	0	RUBIO "We'll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents."
753	0	RUBIO We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs.
754	0	RUBIO "We'll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen."
755	0	RUBIO "We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we're not going to hand out citizenship cards, either."
756	0	RUBIO There will be a process.
757	0	RUBIO We will see what the American people are willing to support.
758	0	RUBIO But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.
759	0	KELLY "Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?"
760	0	BUSH "Well, I'm kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time."
761	0	BUSH "I mean, that's a fact."
762	0	BUSH And he asked me to support that.
763	0	BUSH "And I -- I supported him because I think people, when you're elected, you need to do things."
764	0	BUSH "And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years."
765	0	BUSH "And then he cut and run because it wasn't popular amongst conservatives, I guess."
766	0	BUSH Here's what I believe.
767	0	BUSH And I wrote a book about this called Immigration Wars.
768	0	BUSH You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon.
769	0	BUSH It's not a bestseller.

772	0	BUSH There won't be any -- you can get it.
773	0	BUSH It's affordable for everybody.
774	0	BUSH We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally.
775	0	BUSH "It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English."
776	0	BUSH Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.
777	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
778	0	BUSH I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.
779	0	RUBIO May I respond?
780	0	KELLY "Go ahead, senator."
781	0	RUBIO It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.
782	0	RUBIO That's the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.
783	0	BUSH So did you.
784	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
785	0	RUBIO "Well, but you changed the -- in the book..."
786	0	BUSH Yeah.
787	0	BUSH "So did you, Marco."
788	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
789	0	RUBIO You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization.
790	0	RUBIO "And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control."
791	0	RUBIO "The American people have been told for 30 years they're going to enforce the border, they're going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens."
792	0	RUBIO "It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control."
793	0	RUBIO "And when I'm president, we are going to bring it under control once and for all after 30 years of talking about it."
794	0	BUSH "Marco, Marco -- he brought up my name."
795	0	BUSH I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up.
796	0	BUSH and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States.
797	0	BUSH A bipartisan approach got close.
798	0	BUSH Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.
799	0	BUSH "And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to."
800	0	BUSH I think it's important for people in elected office to try to forge consensus to solve problems.
801	0	BUSH There's never going do be perfect bill.
802	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
803	0	KELLY All right.
804	0	BUSH "But when you didn't do that and you ask people to support, you shouldn't cut and run."
805	0	RUBIO But Megyn...
806	0	BUSH You should stick with it and that's exactly what happened.
807	0	BUSH He cut and run.
808	0	BUSH And that's a tragedy because now...
809	0	SYSTEM (BELL RINGS)
810	0	BUSH ... it's harder and harder to actually solve this problem.
811	0	KELLY All right.
812	0	KELLY This will be the last one.
813	0	RUBIO There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.
814	0	RUBIO That is abundantly clear.
815	0	RUBIO You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.
816	0	RUBIO "The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control."
817	0	RUBIO And until that happens there's not going to be consensus on this issue.
818	0	KELLY OK. Let's move on.
819	0	KELLY "Senator Cruz, when Senator Rubio proposed that bill creating a path to citizenship, you proposed an amendment."
820	0	KELLY It would have allowed for legalization but not citizenship.
821	0	KELLY "Yes, it would."
822	0	KELLY "Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn't."
823	0	KELLY Right?
824	0	KELLY Like you just did.
825	0	KELLY Saw that.
826	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
827	0	KELLY "You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it's something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through."
828	0	KELLY "But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time."
829	0	KELLY Watch.
830	0	SYSTEM (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
831	0	CRUZ I want this bill to be voted down.
832	0	CRUZ I don't want immigration reform to fail.
833	0	CRUZ I want immigration reform to pass.
834	0	CRUZ "I believe if this amendment were to pass, the chances of this bill passing into law would increase dramatically."
835	0	CRUZ "I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass."
836	0	CRUZ And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem.
837	0	CRUZ "If the proponents of this bill actually demonstrate a commitment not to politics, not to campaigning all the time, but to actually fixing this problem, to finding a middle ground."
838	0	CRUZ "That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table."
839	0	KELLY Was that all an act?
840	0	KELLY It was pretty convincing.
841	0	CRUZ "You know, the amendment you're talking about is one sentence -- it's 38 words."
842	0	CRUZ Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said.
843	1	CRUZ "In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship."
844	1	CRUZ It didn't say a word about legalization.
845	0	CRUZ I introduced...
846	1	KELLY But the bill allowed both.
847	1	KELLY The bill you were amending allowed citizenship and legalization.
848	0	CRUZ "But -- but Megyn, the bill was 1,000 pages."
849	0	CRUZ "I introduced a series of amendments, each designed to fix problems in the bill."
850	0	CRUZ The fact that each amendment didn't fix every problem didn't mean that I supported the rest of the bill.

1014	0	BUSH "Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly."

1016	0	BUSH "That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment."

1088	0	WALLACE "Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith."
1089	0	WALLACE "In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he's going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small."

1091	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
1092	0	KASICH No.
1093	0	KASICH "You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state."
1094	0	KASICH "We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government."
1095	0	KASICH "And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home."
1096	0	KASICH "And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money."
1097	0	KASICH "It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill."
1098	0	KASICH Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.
1099	0	KASICH How has it worked?
1100	1	KASICH "Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent."
1101	0	KASICH That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.
1102	0	KASICH The mentally ill?
1103	0	KASICH "They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them."
1104	0	KASICH "In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance."
1105	0	KASICH "But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do."

1112	0	KASICH We've enacted it in our state.
1113	0	KASICH "Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America."
1114	0	KASICH Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.

1125	0	WALLACE "Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience."
1126	0	WALLACE But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.
1127	0	CHRISTIE "No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed."
1128	0	CHRISTIE And that someone in that office has to do their job.
1129	0	CHRISTIE "So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky."
1130	0	CHRISTIE I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.
1131	0	CHRISTIE But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.
1132	0	CHRISTIE "And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do."
1133	0	CHRISTIE "But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said."
1134	0	CHRISTIE "You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith."
1135	0	CHRISTIE And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.

1137	0	CHRISTIE And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.
1138	0	CHRISTIE They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.
1139	0	CHRISTIE They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.
1140	0	CHRISTIE "That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls."

1150	0	RUBIO But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.
1151	0	RUBIO And I think this is an important question.
1152	0	RUBIO "I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history."
1153	0	RUBIO "You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?"
1154	0	RUBIO Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?
1155	0	RUBIO It is not because of the tax writeoff.
1156	0	RUBIO "It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor."
1157	0	RUBIO This is what's made our nation so special.
1158	0	RUBIO And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.
1159	0	RUBIO "Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures."
1160	0	RUBIO "And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life."

1166	0	WALLACE You said you were more concerned about the national debt.
1167	0	WALLACE Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.
1168	0	WALLACE "Does that mean that if a liberal state, let's say, wants to make abortion legal, that you're okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?"
1169	0	PAUL "You know, I think abortion is always wrong."
1170	0	PAUL "I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal."
1171	0	PAUL "In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb."
1172	0	PAUL "But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people."
1173	0	PAUL "In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people."
1174	0	PAUL "Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint."
1175	0	PAUL There's a lot packed into that statement.
1176	0	PAUL "But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation."

1178	0	PAUL "But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way."

1181	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1182	0	WALLACE Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question.
1183	0	WALLACE "Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states' rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that's their choice?"
1184	0	WALLACE Yes or no?
1185	0	PAUL Both.
1186	0	PAUL "No, both the federal and a state approach."
1187	0	PAUL I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.
1188	0	PAUL So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.
1189	0	PAUL "But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states."
1190	0	PAUL So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.
1191	0	PAUL "If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again."
1192	0	PAUL "I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives."

1198	0	BAIER "Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia's actions inside Ukraine."
1199	0	BAIER "Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia."
1200	0	BAIER "Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article V, an attack on one is an attack on all."
1201	0	BAIER What do you do?
1202	0	CARSON "Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down."
1203	0	CARSON "And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region."
1204	0	CARSON I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.
1205	0	CARSON We only have one or two.
1206	0	CARSON We need much more than that.
1207	0	CARSON We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.
1208	0	CARSON They're terrified by the saber rattling.
1209	0	CARSON I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.
1210	0	CARSON I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country oil and energy.
1211	0	CARSON And we ought to fight them on that level.
1212	0	CARSON "We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained."
1213	0	CARSON "So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked."

1218	0	BAIER "But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars -- tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe."
1219	0	BAIER "The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal."
1220	0	BAIER "So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran."
1221	0	BAIER "So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?"
1222	0	RUBIO "Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state."
1223	0	RUBIO And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.
1224	0	RUBIO "But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future."
1225	0	RUBIO "He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet."
1226	0	RUBIO "And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage."
1227	0	RUBIO "That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon."
1228	0	RUBIO "We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice."
1229	0	RUBIO "They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy."

1235	0	KASICH "We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective."

1238	0	KASICH "You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on."
1239	0	KASICH We need to move aggressively now.
1240	0	KASICH "But I would say this to you, Bret."
1241	0	KASICH "Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them."
1242	0	KASICH "And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out."
1243	0	KASICH That is what we have to do.

1296	0	PAUL I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.
1297	0	PAUL I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.
1298	0	PAUL "But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired."

72	0	TRUMP Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting.
73	0	TRUMP They're voting out of enthusiasm.
74	0	TRUMP They're voting out of love.
75	0	TRUMP "Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before - 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old - never voted before."
76	0	TRUMP We're taking people from the Democrat Party.
77	0	TRUMP "We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it."
78	0	TRUMP It's very exciting.
79	0	TRUMP "I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening."
80	0	TRUMP We're having millions of extra people join.
81	0	TRUMP We are going to beat the Democrats.
82	0	TRUMP We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be.

84	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
85	0	TAPPER Thank you.
86	0	TAPPER Thank you.
87	0	TAPPER "Let's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election."
88	0	TAPPER There have been some real differences expressed in - on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers.
89	0	TAPPER "One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls ""disastrous trade deals"" in order to bring jobs back to America."
90	0	TAPPER "Governor Kasich, I'd like to start with you."
91	0	TAPPER You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years.
92	0	TAPPER "Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs."
93	0	TAPPER How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?
94	0	KASICH "Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family."
95	0	KASICH And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade.
96	0	KASICH One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.
97	0	KASICH "But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade."
98	0	KASICH "And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, ""Oh, America was right,"" and people are out of work."
99	0	KASICH The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process.
100	0	KASICH "When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle."
101	0	KASICH "And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker."
102	0	KASICH But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world.
103	0	KASICH "Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up."
104	0	KASICH People will buy less.
105	0	KASICH Other people will be out of work.
106	0	KASICH And we don't want to see that happen.
107	0	KASICH "Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up."
108	0	KASICH "And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar."
109	0	KASICH I understand their plight.
110	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
111	0	TAPPER "Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico."
112	0	TAPPER Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses?
113	0	TRUMP Because nobody knows the system better than me.
114	0	TRUMP I know the H1B.
115	0	TRUMP I know the H2B.
116	0	TRUMP Nobody knows it better than me.
117	0	TRUMP I'm a businessman.
118	0	TRUMP These are laws.
119	0	TRUMP These are regulations.
120	0	TRUMP These are rules.
121	0	TRUMP We're allowed to do it.
122	0	TRUMP "And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete."
123	0	TRUMP So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws.
124	0	TRUMP But I'm the one that knows how to change it.
125	0	TRUMP "Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me."
126	0	TAPPER "Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, ""generally very much in favor of free trade."""
127	0	TAPPER "More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals."
128	0	TAPPER "If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?"
129	0	RUBIO "No, I support free trade deals that are good for America."
130	0	RUBIO We're 5 percent of the world's population.
131	0	RUBIO "If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth."
132	0	RUBIO We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.
133	0	RUBIO The problem is we're a low-tariff country.
134	0	RUBIO "To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high."
135	0	RUBIO And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.
136	0	RUBIO There are good trade deals and there are bad ones.
137	0	RUBIO "So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia."
138	0	RUBIO It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry.
139	0	RUBIO We have a surplus with Colombia.
140	0	RUBIO "On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others."
141	0	RUBIO "Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet."
142	0	RUBIO "If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century."
143	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
144	0	TAPPER "Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position."
145	0	TAPPER Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?
146	0	CRUZ Actually that's incorrect.
147	0	CRUZ There are two different agreements.
148	0	CRUZ There's TPA and TPP.
149	0	CRUZ "I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about."
150	0	CRUZ "And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans."
151	0	CRUZ But we're getting killed in international trade right now.
152	0	CRUZ And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas.
153	0	CRUZ We're driving jobs overseas.
154	0	CRUZ "And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry."
155	0	CRUZ "But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry."
156	0	CRUZ This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.
157	0	CRUZ And you've got to understand.
158	0	CRUZ "Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country."
159	0	CRUZ "So the question is, what's the solution?"
160	0	CRUZ It's easy to talk about the problems.
161	0	CRUZ But do you have a solution to fix it?
162	0	CRUZ And I think the solution is several things.
163	0	CRUZ "Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room."
164	0	CRUZ "Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back."
165	0	CRUZ "And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America."
166	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
167	0	TAPPER Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers.
168	0	TAPPER Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.
169	0	TAPPER Stephen.
170	0	DINAN "Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers."
171	0	DINAN Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements.
172	0	DINAN You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers.
173	0	DINAN Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?
174	0	RUBIO If it's being abused the way Disney did.
175	0	RUBIO "Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers."
176	0	RUBIO "Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans."
177	0	RUBIO "And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again."
178	0	RUBIO The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad.
179	0	RUBIO "They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India."
180	0	RUBIO That company then hoards up all of these visas.
181	0	RUBIO They hire workers.
182	0	RUBIO You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company.
183	0	RUBIO What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing.
184	0	RUBIO "They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business."
185	0	RUBIO "And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it."
186	0	RUBIO "It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans."
187	0	RUBIO "And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future."
188	0	DINAN "Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this."
189	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
190	0	DINAN "You've - in the - in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured."
191	0	RUBIO Correct.
192	0	DINAN Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.
193	0	RUBIO "Well first, I think - well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause."
194	0	RUBIO But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law.
195	0	RUBIO What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.
196	0	RUBIO "If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law."
197	0	RUBIO "And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not - what they are doing is they are eliminating the job."
198	0	RUBIO They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company.
199	0	RUBIO They are making the argument that we didn't replace you.
200	0	RUBIO We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead.
201	0	RUBIO And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad.
202	0	RUBIO It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.
203	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
204	0	DINAN "Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next."
205	0	DINAN "Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, ""lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers""."
206	0	DINAN He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers.
207	0	DINAN Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?
208	0	KASICH "Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled."
209	0	KASICH The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here.
210	0	KASICH I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.
211	0	KASICH Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country.
212	0	KASICH But we clearly have to control our borders.
213	0	KASICH We can't have people just walking in.
214	0	KASICH "Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes."
215	0	KASICH The country has to be able to lock its doors as well.
216	0	KASICH "So, we - I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration."
217	0	KASICH I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border.
218	0	KASICH "And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back."
219	0	KASICH No excuses because we can't continue this problem.
220	0	KASICH "I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home."
221	0	KASICH "And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization."
222	0	KASICH Not to citizenship.
223	0	KASICH I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.
224	0	KASICH "But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget."
225	0	KASICH "We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington."
226	0	KASICH "And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor"
227	0	DINAN "Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you."
228	0	DINAN "Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like."
229	0	TRUMP I will.
230	0	TRUMP "First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well."

236	0	TRUMP It's very bad for business in terms of - and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers.

249	0	DINAN The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers.
250	0	DINAN What should the right level be?
251	0	CRUZ "Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy."
252	0	CRUZ "Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers."
253	0	CRUZ What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans.

264	0	CRUZ It's not that we don't know how to do it.
265	0	CRUZ It's that we're lacking the political will.
266	0	CRUZ Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.
267	0	CRUZ The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.

272	0	RUBIO "Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all."
273	0	RUBIO They are just coming in primarily based on family connection.
274	0	RUBIO "And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system."
275	0	RUBIO The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago.
276	0	RUBIO The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills.
277	0	RUBIO "When my parents came, they had a very limited education."
278	0	RUBIO My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work.
279	0	RUBIO And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school.

287	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
288	0	TAPPER Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy.
289	0	TAPPER The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world.
290	0	TAPPER American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading.
291	0	TAPPER "Mr. Trump, you've called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster."
292	0	TAPPER What are your specific objections to Common Core?
293	0	TRUMP "Education through Washington, D.C."
294	0	TRUMP I don't want that.
295	0	TRUMP I want local education.
296	0	TRUMP "I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great."
297	0	TRUMP "And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is..."
298	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
299	0	TRUMP We were talking.
300	0	TRUMP We spoke for over an hour on education.
301	0	TRUMP And he has such a great handle on it.
302	0	TRUMP He wants competitive schools.
303	0	TRUMP "He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy."
304	0	TRUMP But charter schools work and they work very well.
305	0	TRUMP So there are a lot of things.
306	0	TRUMP "But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his."
307	0	TAPPER OK.
308	0	TAPPER "But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards."
309	0	TAPPER "So when you say ""education by Washington, D.C.,"" what do you mean?"
310	0	TRUMP "You're right, Jake."
311	1	TRUMP But it has been taken over by the federal government.
312	0	TRUMP It was originally supposed to be that way.
313	0	TRUMP And certainly sounds better that way.
314	1	TRUMP "But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases."
315	0	TRUMP Now in some cases they would be.
316	0	TRUMP But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.
317	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
318	0	TAPPER "Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria."
319	0	TAPPER What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?
320	0	KASICH "Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards."
321	0	KASICH "First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states."
322	0	KASICH "OK, I've been working on this for many, many years."
323	0	KASICH "Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards."
324	0	KASICH "And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately."
325	0	KASICH They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.
326	0	KASICH "Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law."
327	0	KASICH "And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state."
328	0	KASICH "Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids?"
329	0	KASICH We need to start connecting them to the real world.
330	0	KASICH "We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago."
331	0	KASICH "We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs."
332	0	KASICH "Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion."
333	0	KASICH "And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be."
334	0	KASICH "So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards."

338	0	TAPPER You object to Common Core.
339	0	TAPPER Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards.
340	0	TAPPER What's wrong with that?
341	0	CRUZ Common Core is a disaster.
342	0	CRUZ "And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day."
343	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
344	0	CRUZ "Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions."
345	0	CRUZ The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states.
346	0	CRUZ It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.
347	0	CRUZ "Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that."
348	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
349	0	CRUZ "Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments."
350	0	CRUZ "And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships."
351	0	CRUZ "And give every child - African American, Hispanic - every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education."
352	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
353	0	TAPPER Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida.
354	0	TAPPER Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country.
355	0	TAPPER "There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations."
356	0	TAPPER Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.
357	0	BASH "Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable."
358	0	BASH "For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans."
359	0	BASH "So, what should the new retirement age be?"
360	0	BASH And how much will those benefits be cut?
361	0	RUBIO "Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare."
362	0	RUBIO "One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today."
363	0	RUBIO I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother.
364	0	RUBIO And we don't have to make any changes for them.
365	0	RUBIO But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying.
366	0	RUBIO "Any politician that goes around saying, ""We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,"" they're not being honest with you."
367	0	RUBIO Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it.
368	0	RUBIO "So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents."
369	0	RUBIO "For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68."
370	0	RUBIO "If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there."
371	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
372	0	RUBIO "If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money."
373	0	RUBIO "And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better."
374	0	RUBIO Medicare Advantage does that now.
375	0	RUBIO "These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire."
376	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
377	0	BASH "Senator, the question was specific though."
378	0	BASH "You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?"
379	0	RUBIO "Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part."
380	0	RUBIO "So the thing is that my - my generation, someone my age would retire at 68."
381	0	RUBIO We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70.
382	0	RUBIO And so my children would retire at 70.
383	0	RUBIO I would retire at 68.
384	0	RUBIO It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.
385	0	RUBIO But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old.
386	0	RUBIO We're years away from retirement.
387	0	RUBIO "For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all."
388	0	RUBIO "If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis."
389	0	RUBIO It's not a question of if.
390	0	RUBIO It is a question of when.
391	0	RUBIO "In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt."
392	0	RUBIO That's - all of it will be eaten up by that.
393	0	RUBIO That's a debt crisis.
394	0	RUBIO And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.
395	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
396	0	BASH "Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans."
397	0	BASH "But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years."
398	0	BASH "So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?"
399	0	TRUMP "Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security."
400	0	TRUMP They're leaving it the way it is.
401	0	TRUMP "In fact, they want to increase it."
402	0	TRUMP They want to actually give more.
403	0	TRUMP And that's what we're up against.
404	0	TRUMP "And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against."
405	0	TRUMP "I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant."
406	0	TRUMP And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is.
407	0	TRUMP Not increase the age and to leave it as is.
408	0	TRUMP "You have 22 years, you have a long time to go."
409	0	TRUMP "It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it."
410	0	TRUMP "I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP..."
411	1	TRUMP "I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters."
412	0	TRUMP If that ever happened in China.
413	0	TRUMP you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before.
414	0	TRUMP "They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a - it's a national tragedy."
415	1	TRUMP "We're at zero, we're not doing anything."
416	0	TRUMP We've lost our jobs.
417	0	TRUMP We've lost everything.
418	0	TRUMP We're losing everything.
419	0	TRUMP "Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country."
420	0	TRUMP I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is.
421	0	TRUMP "We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business."
422	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
423	0	BASH "Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in."
424	0	BASH "Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump."
425	0	BASH "You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent."
426	0	BASH So how would you find that other $147 million?
427	0	TRUMP Because they don't cover most of the subjects.
428	0	TRUMP We're the policemen of the world.
429	0	TRUMP We take care of the entire world.
430	0	TRUMP "We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger."
431	0	TRUMP Our military is depleted.

433	0	TRUMP "We take - every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships."
434	0	TRUMP We get virtually nothing.
435	0	TRUMP "We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea."
436	0	TRUMP We have so many places.
437	0	TRUMP "Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them."

439	0	TRUMP "We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country."

442	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
443	0	BASH "Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?"
444	0	RUBIO No.
445	0	RUBIO And I - and I think you've outlined why.
446	0	RUBIO The numbers don't add up.
447	0	RUBIO "You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign."
448	0	RUBIO "In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in Florida."
449	0	RUBIO Fraud is not enough.
450	0	RUBIO "Certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up."
451	0	RUBIO You already gave those numbers.
452	0	RUBIO The second point is on foreign aid.
453	0	RUBIO I hear that all the time as well.
454	0	RUBIO "I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget."
455	0	RUBIO The numbers don't add up.
456	0	RUBIO The bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse.
457	0	RUBIO "Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid."
458	0	RUBIO But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.
459	0	RUBIO And here's the thing.
460	0	RUBIO "If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis."
461	0	RUBIO Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare.
462	0	RUBIO Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it.
463	0	RUBIO It is one of the major issues confronting America.
464	0	RUBIO It's barely been asked in any of these debates.

527	0	CRUZ "I've specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs."
528	0	CRUZ "And Dana, you know why political candidates don't do that?"
529	0	CRUZ "Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you."
530	0	CRUZ "When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked."
531	0	CRUZ Let's talk for example back in Iowa the first primary.
532	1	CRUZ "When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide."
533	0	CRUZ You can't take on ethanol in Iowa.
534	0	CRUZ And my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same.
535	0	CRUZ They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.
536	0	SYSTEM (BELL RINGS)
537	0	CRUZ "If we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer."
538	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
539	0	BASH Thank you Senator Cruz.
540	0	BASH "Mr. Trump, would you like to respond?"
541	0	TRUMP Yes.
542	1	TRUMP "If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit."
543	0	TRUMP He did and - at the end.
544	1	TRUMP "Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well."
545	0	TRUMP "And you know, I think everybody knows that."
546	1	TRUMP "It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change."
547	0	BASH Senator Cruz?
548	0	CRUZ "Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington?"
549	0	CRUZ "It's easy to have language, I'm fed up with the corruption in Washington."
550	0	CRUZ "But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington."
551	0	CRUZ "When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare."
552	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
553	0	CRUZ "When I led the fight against amnesty, it's because I was standing with the people..."
554	0	SYSTEM (BELL RINGS)
555	0	CRUZ ... against Washington.
556	0	CRUZ "And if you want to tell people you're going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?"
557	0	BASH "OK. Mr. Trump, I'll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I'm going to move to Governor Kasich."
558	0	BASH Go ahead.
559	0	TRUMP "Well, that's fine."
560	1	TRUMP "First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty."
561	0	TRUMP So there's no question about that.
562	0	TRUMP And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe.
563	0	TRUMP "And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me."
564	0	TRUMP And there's nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions.
565	0	TRUMP I would say this.
566	0	TRUMP We're all in this together.
567	0	TRUMP We're going to come up with solutions.
568	0	TRUMP We're going to find the answers to things.
569	0	TRUMP And so far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.
570	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
571	0	BASH "Governor Kasich, let's get back to Social Security."
572	0	BASH "You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, ""Get over cuts to Social Security benefits"" because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there."
573	0	BASH Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution?
574	0	KASICH "Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington."
575	0	KASICH I took on Washington and I won.
576	0	KASICH "I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee."
577	0	KASICH We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt.
578	0	KASICH We also balanced the budget four years in a row.
579	0	KASICH And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then.
580	0	KASICH "I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts."
581	0	KASICH Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.
582	0	KASICH I have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age.
583	0	KASICH "If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it."
584	0	KASICH It will just simply be less.
585	0	KASICH "And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit."
586	0	KASICH That's the way it will work.
587	0	KASICH And we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age.
588	0	KASICH And how do I know that?
589	0	KASICH I've done all this before.
590	0	KASICH This is not a theory.
591	0	KASICH Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget?
592	0	KASICH Yes.
593	0	KASICH It doesn't mean you have to cut them.
594	0	KASICH "It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century."
595	0	KASICH "So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black."
596	0	KASICH Our credit is strong.
597	1	KASICH "We're up 400,000 jobs."
598	0	KASICH And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.
599	0	KASICH "And I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result."
600	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
601	0	TAPPER "Thank you, Governor."
602	0	TAPPER Let's take a broader look at the Republican Party now.
603	0	TAPPER "Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition."
604	0	TAPPER How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader?
605	0	TAPPER What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?
606	0	TRUMP "Well, first of all, I don't really think that."
607	0	TRUMP I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people.
608	0	TRUMP We are more inclusive.
609	0	TRUMP "And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story."
610	0	TRUMP "You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening."
611	0	TRUMP "I am different in one primary respect, and that's trade."
612	0	TRUMP "I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals."
613	0	TRUMP "The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs."
614	0	TRUMP "You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed."
615	0	TRUMP So that's that.
616	0	TRUMP "But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country."
617	0	TRUMP "The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game."
618	0	TRUMP and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.
619	0	TRUMP "If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs."
620	0	TRUMP "And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up."
621	0	TRUMP It has gone down.
622	0	TRUMP And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.
623	0	TAPPER "Thank you, Mr. Trump."
624	0	TAPPER Senator Cruz...
625	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
626	0	TAPPER ... Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote.
627	0	TAPPER Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party.
628	0	TAPPER What do you think is wrong with that vision?
629	0	CRUZ "Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade."
630	0	CRUZ He's right about the problems.
631	0	CRUZ But his solutions don't work.
632	0	CRUZ "So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods."
633	0	CRUZ Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight.
634	0	CRUZ I don't know where he'll be tonight.
635	0	CRUZ But I'll tell you what happens.
636	0	CRUZ "You know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression."
637	0	CRUZ "And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent."
638	0	CRUZ "But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs."
639	0	CRUZ "A much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs."
640	0	CRUZ Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says.
641	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
642	0	TAPPER "Mr. Trump, we'll give you a chance to respond."
643	0	TRUMP The 45 percent tax is a threat.
644	0	TRUMP "It was not a tax, it was a threat."
645	0	TRUMP It will be a tax if they don't behave.
646	0	TRUMP Take China as an example.
647	0	TRUMP "I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China."
648	0	TRUMP They can't.
649	0	TRUMP China won't let them.
650	0	TRUMP We talk about free trade.
651	0	TRUMP "It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade."
652	0	TRUMP China dumps everything that they have over here.
653	0	TRUMP "No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything."
654	0	TRUMP We can't get into China.
655	0	TRUMP "I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in."
656	0	TRUMP "When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax."
657	0	TRUMP "The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you."
658	0	TRUMP "It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less."
659	0	TRUMP But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.
660	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
661	0	TAPPER Senator Cruz?
662	0	CRUZ "Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said."
663	0	CRUZ He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat.
664	0	CRUZ "And mind you, you are paying the tax."
665	0	CRUZ It's not China that pays the tax.
666	0	CRUZ "It's you, the working men and women."
667	0	CRUZ So ask yourself at home
668	0	CRUZ How is this helping you?
669	0	CRUZ "If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, ""I'm going to jack - I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing."""
670	0	CRUZ That hurts you.
671	0	CRUZ "It's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem."
672	0	CRUZ Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.
673	0	TAPPER OK.
674	0	TRUMP "Jake, I have to say - honestly, it's just the opposite."
675	0	TRUMP "What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants."
676	0	TRUMP "Instead of in China, we'll build them here."
677	0	TRUMP "And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off."
678	1	TRUMP And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.
679	0	TRUMP So we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products.
680	0	TRUMP And that's the way it should be done.
681	0	TRUMP "And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country - our country is in serious, serious trouble."
682	0	TRUMP "It's a bubble and it's going to explode, believe me."
683	0	TAPPER All right.
684	0	TAPPER We're going to take a very quick break.
685	0	TAPPER "When we come back, we'll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this."
686	0	TAPPER Stay with us.
687	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
688	0	SYSTEM (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
689	0	TAPPER "Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida."
690	0	TAPPER "Mr. Trump, let me start with you."
691	0	TAPPER "Last night, you told CNN quote, ""Islam hates us?"""
692	0	TAPPER Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims.
693	0	TRUMP I mean a lot of them.
694	0	TRUMP I mean a lot of them.
695	0	DINAN Do you want to clarify the comment at all?
696	0	TRUMP "Well, you know, I've been watching the debate today."
697	0	TRUMP And they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam.
698	0	TRUMP But I will tell you this.
699	0	TRUMP "There's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred."
700	0	TRUMP And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper.
701	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
702	0	DINAN "Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump's comment last night, I'm sorry - Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize."
703	0	DINAN "Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this."
704	0	DINAN Do you agree?
705	0	RUBIO "Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say."
706	0	RUBIO "The problem is, presidents can't just say anything they want."
707	0	RUBIO "It has consequences, here and around the world."
708	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
709	0	RUBIO And so let me give you one.
710	0	RUBIO "Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh."
711	0	RUBIO It's a very tough place to be a missionary.
712	0	RUBIO It's Muslim.
713	0	RUBIO "And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them."
714	0	RUBIO And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well.
715	0	RUBIO "And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims."
716	0	RUBIO So this is a real impact.
717	0	RUBIO There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.
718	0	RUBIO "I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there."
719	0	RUBIO If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims.
720	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
721	0	RUBIO And they love America.
722	0	RUBIO "And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military."
723	0	RUBIO Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America.
724	0	RUBIO No matter what their religious background may be.
725	0	DINAN Mr. Trump?
726	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
727	0	TRUMP Marco talks about consequences.
728	0	TRUMP "Well, we've had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House."
729	0	TRUMP There have been a lot of problems.
730	0	TRUMP "Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want."
731	0	TRUMP I don't want to be so politically correct.
732	0	TRUMP I like to solve problems.
733	0	TRUMP "We have a serious, serious problem of hate."
734	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
735	0	TRUMP There is tremendous hate.
736	0	TRUMP There is tremendous hate.
737	0	TRUMP "Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means."
738	0	TRUMP Let me go a step further.
739	0	TRUMP Women are treated horribly.
740	0	TRUMP You know that.
741	0	TRUMP You do know that.
742	0	TRUMP "Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad."
743	0	SYSTEM (BELL RINGS)
744	0	TRUMP "Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred."
745	0	TRUMP "The question was asked, what do you think?"
746	0	TRUMP "I said, there is hatred."
747	0	TRUMP Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently.
748	0	TRUMP "And everybody would say, oh, isn't that wonderful."
749	0	DINAN "Mr. Trump, thank you."
750	0	TRUMP We better solve the problem before it's too late.
751	0	DINAN Senator Rubio?
752	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
753	0	RUBIO "Well, here we go."
754	0	RUBIO "See, I'm not interested in being politically correct."
755	0	RUBIO I'm not interested in being politically correct.
756	0	RUBIO I'm interested in being correct.
757	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
758	0	RUBIO "And in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line."
759	0	RUBIO We do work.
760	0	RUBIO There is - Islam has a major problem on its hands.
761	0	RUBIO "It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized."
762	0	RUBIO And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.
763	0	RUBIO There is no doubt about that.
764	0	RUBIO "It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other - with Muslims, who do not - who are not radicals."
765	0	RUBIO We're going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.
766	0	RUBIO We're going to have to work with the Saudis.
767	0	RUBIO We're going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms.
768	0	RUBIO "We're going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS."
769	0	SYSTEM (BELL RING)
770	0	RUBIO It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.
771	0	RUBIO And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct.
772	0	RUBIO We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.
773	0	TAPPER "Thank you, Senator."
774	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
775	0	TAPPER "Governor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us?"
776	0	KASICH "No, I don't."
777	0	KASICH "I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today."
778	0	KASICH There isn't any question.
779	0	KASICH And that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.
780	0	KASICH "But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait."
781	0	KASICH "The fact is that if we're going to defeat ISIS, we're going to have to have these countries."
782	0	KASICH And they are Egypt.
783	0	KASICH And they are Saudi Arabia.
784	0	KASICH And they are Jordan.
785	0	KASICH And they are the Gulf states.
786	0	KASICH And we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey.
787	0	KASICH And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe.
788	0	KASICH "The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just - they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith."
789	0	KASICH "Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we're about and other Muslims who don't share their view."
790	0	KASICH "But at the end of the day, we've got to bring the world together, the civilized world."
791	0	KASICH "And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody."
792	0	TAPPER "Thank you, Governor Kasich."
793	0	TAPPER "Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you've said during the course of this campaign."
794	0	TAPPER "You said that the U.S. has to, quote, ""take out"" the families of terrorists."
795	0	TAPPER "When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, ""So they can kill us, but we can't kill them?"""
796	0	TAPPER "It is against federal, military and international law to target civilians."
797	0	TAPPER "So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?"
798	0	TRUMP Let me go back to the other just for a second.
799	0	TRUMP "In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting ""death to the USA."""
800	0	TRUMP "Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me."
801	0	TRUMP "As far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law - this all started with your question on water boarding."
802	0	TRUMP We have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding.
803	0	TRUMP They have no laws.
804	0	TRUMP They have no rules.
805	0	TRUMP They have no regulations.
806	0	TRUMP They chop off heads.
807	0	TRUMP "They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead."
808	0	TRUMP And we're working on a different set of parameters.
809	0	TRUMP "Now, we have to obey the laws."
810	0	TRUMP Have to obey the laws.
811	0	TRUMP "But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad."
812	0	TRUMP "We better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us."
813	0	TRUMP "They are laughing at us, believe me."
814	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
815	0	TAPPER "Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?"
816	0	RUBIO "No, of course not."
817	0	RUBIO And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists.
818	0	RUBIO The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward.
819	0	RUBIO "It's difficult to do, but it has to be done."
820	0	RUBIO "When I'm president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung."
821	0	RUBIO They're going to be expanded.
822	0	RUBIO And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.
823	0	RUBIO "And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because - because Barack Obama is gutting our military."
824	0	RUBIO "He's going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we've ever had."
825	0	RUBIO We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them.
826	0	RUBIO "And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent."
827	0	RUBIO And they're not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan.
828	0	RUBIO "They're going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally."
829	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)

1023	0	RUBIO "And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job."
1024	0	RUBIO Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn't working.

1034	0	TAPPER Should veterans' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?
1035	0	KASICH "I don't - I haven't seen the provisions of that bill, Jake."
1036	0	KASICH My initial instincts are no.

1038	0	KASICH "When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one."
1039	0	KASICH "Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured."
1040	0	KASICH It needs to be downsized and spread out.
1041	0	KASICH It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.
1042	0	KASICH "And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job."
1043	0	KASICH "And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees."
1044	0	KASICH No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.

1050	0	TAPPER Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash.
1051	0	BASH "Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba."
1052	0	BASH The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well.
1053	0	BASH "So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?"
1054	0	RUBIO "Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change."
1055	0	RUBIO "But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government."
1056	0	RUBIO "Today, it has not."
1057	0	RUBIO "The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made - after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime."
1058	0	RUBIO It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone.
1059	0	RUBIO They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there.
1060	0	RUBIO They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president.
1061	0	RUBIO And nothing will change for the Cuban people.
1062	0	RUBIO There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights.
1063	0	RUBIO "In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening."
1064	0	RUBIO The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.
1065	0	RUBIO And we asked nothing in return.
1066	0	RUBIO Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma.
1067	0	RUBIO And by no means is Burma a perfect country.
1068	0	RUBIO "But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings."
1069	0	RUBIO "When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening."
1070	0	RUBIO "And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body."
1071	0	RUBIO He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return.
1072	0	RUBIO "And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions."

1079	0	TRUMP I think I'm somewhere in the middle.
1080	0	TRUMP "What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making - as usual with our country, we don't make good deal."
1081	0	TRUMP "We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue."
1082	0	TRUMP "As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion."
1083	0	TRUMP All that stuff has to be agreed to now.
1084	0	TRUMP We don't want to get sued after the deal is made.
1085	0	TRUMP "So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be - should take place."
1086	0	TRUMP "After 50 years, it's enough time, folks."
1087	0	TRUMP But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.
1088	0	TRUMP "This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations."
1089	0	TRUMP "So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently."
1090	0	TRUMP We have to make good deal.
1091	0	BASH "Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in."
1092	0	BASH "But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?"
1093	0	TRUMP "I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba's favor."
1094	0	TRUMP "Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor."
1095	0	TRUMP It the same way as the Iran deal.
1096	0	TRUMP We never walked - we never - all we do is keep giving.
1097	0	TRUMP We give and give and give.
1098	0	BASH "But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it."
1099	0	BASH Which would it be?
1100	0	BASH In Havana.
1101	0	TRUMP I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States.
1102	0	TRUMP (APPLAUSE)
1103	0	RUBIO "All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate."
1104	0	RUBIO It's the same building.

1106	0	RUBIO We don't have to close it that way.
1107	0	RUBIO "Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose."
1108	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
1109	0	RUBIO "Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal."
1110	0	RUBIO "I'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified."
1111	0	RUBIO "Here's a good deal - Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs."
1112	0	RUBIO And you know what?
1113	0	RUBIO Then we can have a relationship with Cuba.
1114	0	RUBIO That's a good deal.

1121	0	CRUZ "When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry."
1122	0	CRUZ There's a real difference between us.
1123	0	CRUZ Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.
1124	0	CRUZ And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing.
1125	0	CRUZ "The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective."
1126	0	CRUZ "I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us."

1130	0	TRUMP "Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar."
1131	0	TRUMP I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us.
1132	0	TRUMP And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear.
1133	0	TRUMP "And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States."
1134	0	TRUMP "As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal."
1135	0	TRUMP "That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country."
1136	0	TRUMP It is a disaster.
1137	0	TRUMP "So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated."

1139	0	BASH "Senator Cruz, your response?"
1140	0	CRUZ "Well, look."
1141	0	CRUZ "I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008."
1142	0	CRUZ "And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry."

1144	0	CRUZ No.

1154	0	TRUMP I was against the giving of the money at all cost.
1155	0	TRUMP I said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back.
1156	0	TRUMP If the prisoners don't come back early - three years ago.
1157	0	TRUMP "One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way."
1158	0	TRUMP "If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate."
1159	0	TRUMP They come back early.
1160	0	TRUMP "What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions."
1161	0	TRUMP What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal.
1162	0	TRUMP Cause that deal is a disaster.
1163	0	TRUMP "Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators."
1164	0	TRUMP "But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States."

1199	0	TAPPER "Mayor Regalado told me, quote, ""Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It's an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?"""
1200	0	TAPPER Unquote.
1201	0	TAPPER "Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you."
1202	0	TAPPER Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?
1203	1	RUBIO "Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing."
1204	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1205	1	RUBIO There's never been a time when the climate has not changed.
1206	0	RUBIO "I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?"
1207	0	RUBIO "So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things."
1208	0	RUBIO "Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp."
1209	0	RUBIO "And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation."
1210	0	RUBIO And I have long supported mitigation efforts.
1211	0	RUBIO "But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there's no such thing."
1212	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1213	0	RUBIO "On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass."
1214	0	RUBIO There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.
1215	0	RUBIO Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that?
1216	0	RUBIO Americans are going to pay the price of that.
1217	0	RUBIO "The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living."
1218	0	RUBIO The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.
1219	0	RUBIO And you know what passing those laws would have - what impact it would have on the environment?
1220	1	RUBIO "Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels."
1221	0	RUBIO "So, I am in favor of a clean environment."
1222	0	RUBIO My children live in South Florida.
1223	0	RUBIO My family is being raised here.
1224	0	RUBIO "I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy."
1225	0	TAPPER "So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change."
1226	0	TAPPER "When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he's wrong?"
1227	0	RUBIO I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that.
1228	1	RUBIO "If we pass - if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment."
1229	1	RUBIO Sea level would still rise.
1230	0	RUBIO All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.
1231	0	RUBIO "One, because America is not a planet."
1232	0	RUBIO It's a country.
1233	1	RUBIO "And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut."
1234	0	RUBIO Here's what he will immediately - and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend - but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.
1235	0	RUBIO "He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power."
1236	0	RUBIO That cost will be passed on to working families.
1237	0	RUBIO I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent.

1242	0	KASICH "In our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent."
1243	0	KASICH But let me tell you also what we're trying to do.
1244	0	KASICH We want all the sources of energy.
1245	0	KASICH "We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it."
1246	0	KASICH We believe in natural gas.
1247	0	KASICH We believe in nuclear power.
1248	0	KASICH And you know what else I believe in?
1249	0	KASICH "I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter."
1250	0	KASICH "Now, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute."
1251	0	KASICH But it is important we develop renewables.
1252	0	KASICH Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.
1253	0	KASICH So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.
1254	0	TAPPER "Thank you, Governor."

1261	1	CRUZ This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks.
1262	1	CRUZ Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America.
1263	0	CRUZ Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on.

1268	0	CRUZ "And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight."
1269	1	CRUZ It's worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.

1288	0	TRUMP "I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin."
1289	0	TAPPER But the word strong obviously is a compliment...
1290	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1291	0	TAPPER ... and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities.
1292	0	TRUMP I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany.
1293	0	TRUMP Germany is a disaster right now.

1307	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1308	0	KASICH "Now I will tell you, I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy."
1309	0	KASICH They are a competitor.
1310	0	KASICH But I want to go back to three things they should do.
1311	0	KASICH "We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one."
1312	0	KASICH "Number two, they need to realize they don't own the South China Sea."
1313	0	KASICH And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea.
1314	0	KASICH "And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we're going to have to beef up the cyber command."
1315	0	KASICH "And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid."
1316	0	KASICH "But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems."
1317	0	KASICH The president has not given the cyber command that authority.
1318	0	KASICH I will.
1319	0	KASICH "And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency."
1320	0	KASICH That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with.

1398	0	TRUMP "But we're all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show and a couple of other place, not too many."
1399	0	TRUMP "Because when you look at it, everyone's smiling, laughing."
1400	0	TRUMP Their arms are raised like this.
1401	0	TRUMP "They had pictures, still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany."
1402	0	SYSTEM (BELL RINGS)
1403	0	TRUMP It is a disgrace.
1404	0	TRUMP It was a total disgrace.
1405	0	TRUMP "And I've had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that - what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace."

1407	0	TAPPER "Governor Kasich, do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party's chances in November?"
1408	0	KASICH "Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period."
1409	0	KASICH "I mean, it's - you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters."
1410	0	KASICH "Jake, here's what I think is happening."
1411	0	KASICH There are people out there who are worried about their jobs.
1412	0	KASICH "They're worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they're out of work and they're 54 years old and they don't know where they're going to get another job, a man and a woman."
1413	0	KASICH Maybe they're worried about a trade deal.
1414	0	KASICH They're worried about the fact that their wages haven't gone up.
1415	0	KASICH "They're worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great."
1416	0	KASICH "They went to college, they rang up debt and they're still living in their parents' basement."
1417	0	KASICH People are uptight.
1418	0	KASICH Our seniors are worried they're going to lose their Social Security.
1419	0	KASICH There's two ways to treat it.
1420	0	KASICH "You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed."
1421	0	KASICH "If we're Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems."
1422	0	KASICH "We can provide financial security, we can drive the wages up, we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy."
1423	0	SYSTEM (BELL RINGS)
1424	0	KASICH And you know what?
1425	0	KASICH They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I'll give them the power to do it.
1426	0	TAPPER Thank you governor.
1427	0	TAPPER Senator Rubio?
1428	0	TAPPER I know you want to say something.
1429	0	RUBIO I do.
1430	0	RUBIO A couple of points.
1431	0	RUBIO "The first is, I'm concerned about violence in general in this society."
1432	0	RUBIO "And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers."
1433	0	RUBIO And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us.
1434	0	RUBIO On the issue of anger.
1435	0	RUBIO "Yes, people are angry."
1436	0	RUBIO Of course they're angry.
1437	0	RUBIO Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years.
1438	0	RUBIO "But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us."
1439	0	RUBIO But to motivate us to take action.
1440	0	RUBIO Being here in Miami is special.
1441	0	RUBIO My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up.
1442	0	RUBIO And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history.
1443	0	RUBIO My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky.
1444	0	RUBIO "One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon."
1445	0	SYSTEM (BELL RINGS)
1446	0	RUBIO You know what he said when he saw that?
1447	0	RUBIO He said Americans can do anything.
1448	0	RUBIO Americans can do anything.
1449	0	RUBIO "There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation."
1450	0	TAPPER Thank you senator.
1451	0	RUBIO And embrace all of the principles that made us great.
1452	0	TAPPER Thank you senator.
1453	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1454	0	TAPPER "The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention, which would mean a contested convention."
1455	0	TAPPER Let's go back to Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt.
1456	0	HEWITT Thank you Jake.
1457	0	HEWITT "Governor Kasich, the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention."
1458	0	HEWITT "If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie, Donald Trump has the most delegates."
1459	0	HEWITT "Why shouldn't the person with the most delegates, even if it's not a majority of delegates, be the nominee?"
1460	0	KASICH "Well, first of all, let's not - you know, math doesn't tell the whole story in politics."
1461	0	KASICH "The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what's true today is not necessarily true tomorrow."
1462	0	KASICH So let's not get ahead of ourselves.
1463	0	KASICH "Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK."
1464	0	KASICH "If you got an 86, you got a B."
1465	0	KASICH Because everybody else had an 84 didn't mean you got an A.
1466	0	KASICH So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee.
1467	0	KASICH "And frankly, I don't know if we're going to get a convention like that."
1468	0	KASICH "But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him."
1469	0	KASICH He tried valiantly.
1470	0	KASICH He lost.
1471	0	KASICH Gerald Ford won.
1472	0	KASICH The party was united.
1473	0	KASICH Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon.
1474	0	KASICH "He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first."
1475	0	KASICH And we were healed as a party.
1476	0	KASICH "So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked."
1477	0	KASICH But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
1478	0	KASICH We don't know what's going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected.
1479	0	KASICH And that's what's going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks.
1480	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1481	0	HEWITT "Thank you, Governor."
1482	0	HEWITT "Mr. Trump, if you arrive in Cleveland with a plurality and the most, but not a majority, is it legitimate for someone else to emerge from that convention the nominee?"
1483	0	HEWITT "And if so, would you support that person?"
1484	0	TRUMP "I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever - first of all, I think I'm going to have the delegates."
1485	0	TRUMP OK?
1486	0	TRUMP I think.
1487	0	TRUMP Let's see what happens.
1488	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1489	0	TRUMP "But if somebody doesn't have the delegates, and I guess there's two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment."
1490	0	TRUMP "But if - no, that's just - by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism."
1491	0	TRUMP That's just a mathematical fact.
1492	0	TRUMP OK?
1493	0	TRUMP "If two of us get up there, I would say this, if - if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win."
1494	0	TRUMP hat's what I think.
1495	0	HEWITT "Senator Cruz, if you - if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention, what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election?"
1496	0	CRUZ "Well, look, there are some folks in Washington..."
1497	0	TRUMP Make me president.
1498	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)

1500	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1501	0	CRUZ "You know, there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention."
1502	0	CRUZ They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee.
1503	0	CRUZ I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters.
1504	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1505	0	CRUZ "It's one of the reasons why in the course of this election - listen, everyone up here has worked very hard."
1506	0	CRUZ "But Donald is right, there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself."
1507	0	CRUZ "At this point, I have roughly 360 delegates."
1508	0	CRUZ He has about 100 more than I have.
1509	0	CRUZ "We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically, from Maine to Alaska, from Kansas to Texas, all over this country we have beaten him."
1510	0	CRUZ "And so for the people at home, if you're one of the 65, 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins."
1511	0	CRUZ That's why the media wants him to be the nominee so much.
1512	0	CRUZ "If you recognize that, then I want to invite you if you've supported other candidates, come and join us."
1513	0	CRUZ We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting.
1514	0	CRUZ It's why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday.
1515	0	CRUZ It's why Mike Lee endorsed me today.
1516	0	CRUZ I ask everyone to come together.
1517	0	CRUZ Let's stand together and let's beat Hillary Clinton in November.
1518	0	HEWITT All right.

1521	0	HEWITT "Mr. Trump, then to Senator Rubio."
1522	0	TRUMP "You know, I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks, and he's always saying, ""I'm the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him."""
1523	0	TRUMP But I beat him in 13 contests.
1524	0	TRUMP He never mentions that.
1525	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1526	0	TRUMP "And let me just tell you another little fact, little minor fact."
1527	0	TRUMP "I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season, more votes than Ted."
1528	1	TRUMP "The other thing is, I beat Hillary, and I will give you the list, I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken."

1531	0	HEWITT Senator Rubio?
1532	0	RUBIO Let me tell you what this election is about for me.
1533	0	RUBIO And I get all the delegate math and all that debate.
1534	0	RUBIO Let me tell you what's about for me.
1535	0	RUBIO "On Tuesday night, I didn't do as well, obviously, as I wanted to."
1536	0	RUBIO And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home.
1537	0	RUBIO "And my wife told me a story that night, which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting."
1538	0	RUBIO There's a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery.
1539	0	RUBIO And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting.
1540	0	RUBIO "But every afternoon, he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says ""Marco Rubio."""
1541	0	RUBIO "Because for him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves"
1542	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1543	0	RUBIO That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him.
1544	0	RUBIO I am going to work tirelessly every single day -
1545	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1546	0	RUBIO ... because this election is too important.
1547	0	RUBIO What's at stake is the future of this country.
1548	0	RUBIO "And I believe - I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I've always believed that God has blessed America, that God's hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come."
1549	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1550	0	TAPPER "Thank you, Senator."
1551	0	TAPPER Let's send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.
1552	0	TAPPER Stephen?
1553	0	DINAN "Mr. Trump, one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign, and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors."
1554	0	DINAN Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election?
1555	0	TRUMP I have not made that decision yet.
1556	0	TRUMP "I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision."
1557	0	TRUMP My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth.
1558	0	TRUMP "I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I'm turning down money."
1559	0	TRUMP I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you.
1560	0	TRUMP I don't know if I get any credit for it but I'm self-funding my campaign.
1561	0	TRUMP "And other than - and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it's not a large amount."
1562	0	TRUMP "No, I'm self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I've been in this business a long time and I was on the other side - until eight months ago I was on the or side."
1563	0	TRUMP "I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans."
1564	0	TRUMP "I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing."
1565	0	TRUMP "I will say this - people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians."
1566	0	TRUMP I don't want anybody to control me but the people right out there.
1567	0	TRUMP And I'm going to do the right thing.
1568	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1569	0	DINAN "Senator Cruz, I want to come to you."
1570	0	DINAN "The vast majority of Republicans, and voters overall, agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns."
1571	0	DINAN Do you deny that those big donors do have influence?
1572	0	CRUZ "Well look, absolutely."
1573	0	CRUZ "And one of the things we're so frustrated about is the corruption, what I've called the Washington cartel."
1574	0	CRUZ It's career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests.
1575	0	CRUZ "And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he's been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party."
1576	0	CRUZ "And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change."
1577	0	CRUZ But the interesting point is tonight he hasn't pointed to a single special interest he's willing to take on.
1578	0	CRUZ He didn't take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street.
1579	0	CRUZ He won't take on ethanol.
1580	0	CRUZ "And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country."
1581	0	DINAN "Thank you, Senator."
1582	0	DINAN I want to go to Mr. Trump...
1583	0	CRUZ $62 at tedcruz.org.
1584	0	DINAN ... for a response.
1585	0	DINAN "Thank you, Senator."
1586	0	CRUZ "That's who you've got to be accountable to, the people."
1587	0	TRUMP Ted was given to PACs.
1588	0	TRUMP "I mean, PACs - you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks."
1589	0	TRUMP Very corrupt.
1590	0	TRUMP It's going to lead to lots of disasters.
1591	0	TRUMP "But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one."
1592	0	TRUMP It's very important to do that.
1593	0	TRUMP "There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived."
1594	0	TRUMP "And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken."
1595	0	TRUMP "And I'm the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I've always made large contributions."
1596	0	TRUMP "And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I'm the only one up here that's going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong."
1597	0	DINAN "Thank you, Mr. Trump."
1598	0	DINAN "Senator Rubio, I want to come to you with a question."
1599	0	DINAN "At the last debate, you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible."
1600	0	DINAN "With so much gridlock in Washington, how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren't willing to show flexibility?"
1601	0	RUBIO "Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn't be flexible about your principles."
1602	0	RUBIO "About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that."
1603	0	RUBIO "Listen, on the issue of higher education, I'm the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt."
1604	0	RUBIO So I know this is a major issue.
1605	0	RUBIO And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan.
1606	0	RUBIO The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a - on a bipartisan basis.
1607	0	RUBIO The sanctions that I helped - that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis.
1608	0	RUBIO "The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis."
1609	0	RUBIO But I also want to be frank.
1610	0	RUBIO There are issues we're going to have to have an election over.
1611	0	RUBIO "When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that's not going to be bipartisan."
1612	0	RUBIO "When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that's not going to be bipartisan."
1613	0	RUBIO "When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that's probably not going to be bipartisan."
1614	0	RUBIO "There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government."
1615	0	RUBIO "And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military."
1616	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1617	0	DINAN All right.
1618	0	DINAN "Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence."
1619	0	DINAN What are some of the other issues on which you're willing to show flexibility?
1620	0	TRUMP It depends on what comes up.
1621	0	TRUMP You never know.
1622	0	TRUMP It depends on what comes up.
1623	0	TRUMP "Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan."
1624	0	TRUMP "We had Tip O'Neill, speaker."
1625	0	TRUMP "And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully."
1626	0	TRUMP Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made.
1627	0	TRUMP And he made it with Tip O'Neill.
1628	0	TRUMP "We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint."
1629	0	TRUMP "And I'll tell you this, it can be done."
1630	0	TRUMP We don't want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind.
1631	0	TRUMP "We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there's total, absolute gridlock."
1632	0	DINAN Thank you.
1633	0	DINAN "I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility, sir."
1634	0	KASICH "Well, look, my record speaks for itself."
1635	0	KASICH What I talk about tonight is not a theory.
1636	0	KASICH These are things that I've done.
1637	0	KASICH I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together.
1638	0	KASICH "I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon."
1639	0	KASICH I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington.
1640	0	KASICH "And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare,"
1641	0	KASICH "I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor."
1642	0	KASICH My problem isn't that people don't know this.
1643	0	KASICH "They say, well, what does that mean?"
1644	0	KASICH Does that mean you're too easy?
1645	0	KASICH "Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government."
1646	0	KASICH "In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years."
1647	0	KASICH Conservative principles will work.
1648	0	KASICH But show respect to the other side.
1649	0	KASICH "One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone."
1650	0	KASICH We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security.
1651	0	KASICH I know how to do it because I've done it and I'll do it again.
1652	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1653	0	TAPPER "Thank you, Governor."
1654	0	TAPPER We have time for one last break.
1655	0	TAPPER We'll be right back after this.

1658	0	TAPPER "And we're back with the Republican presidential debate, just five days before the next primary elections."
1659	0	TAPPER It is time now for closing statements.
1660	0	TAPPER "Candidates, you will each have one minute."
1661	0	TAPPER And we'll start with Governor Kasich.
1662	0	KASICH "Well, I'd like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States."
1663	0	KASICH "I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision."
1664	0	KASICH And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States.
1665	0	KASICH "Sometimes being positive isn't all that interesting, but it's very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign."
1666	0	KASICH "I can fix the problems in Washington, I've done it before."
1667	0	KASICH "And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty."
1668	0	KASICH We can do this together.
1669	0	KASICH Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families.
1670	0	KASICH That's where the spirit and strength of America is.
1671	0	KASICH "But ask the people - my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote."
1672	0	KASICH God bless.
1673	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
1674	0	TAPPER Senator Rubio.
1675	0	RUBIO "It's great to be here, back at home in Miami."
1676	0	RUBIO "It's hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city."
1677	0	RUBIO "And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land."
1678	0	RUBIO My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else.

283	0	TRUMP "He goes by ""DJ"" and ""CJ."""
284	0	TRUMP "He said, ""Call me either one."""
285	0	TRUMP "So we’ll call you ""CJ."""
286	0	TRUMP Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets.
287	0	TRUMP Tough job.
288	0	TRUMP "At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder."
289	0	TRUMP And they wanted it to happen quickly.
290	0	TRUMP But he did not cave to threats or to fear.
291	0	TRUMP "Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island."
292	0	TRUMP "His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang members."
293	0	TRUMP "And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done — we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons."
294	0	TRUMP "So I just want to congratulate you, CJ."
295	0	TRUMP You’re a brave guy.
296	0	TRUMP Thank you very much.
297	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)

299	0	TRUMP "He said, ""We’re just tougher than they are."""
300	0	TRUMP And I like that answer.
301	0	TRUMP (LAUGHTER)
302	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
303	0	TRUMP Now let’s get Congress to send you — and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it; we have no choice.
304	0	TRUMP "CJ, we’re going to send you reinforcements, and we’re going to send them to you quickly."
305	0	TRUMP It’s what you need.
306	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
307	0	TRUMP "Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package."
308	0	TRUMP "In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform."
309	0	TRUMP "Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have."
310	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
311	0	TRUMP Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age.
312	0	TRUMP That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered.
313	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
314	0	TRUMP "Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period."
315	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
316	0	TRUMP The second pillar fully secures the border.
317	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
318	0	TRUMP "That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like CJ, to keep our communities safe."
319	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
320	0	TRUMP "Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release."
321	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
322	1	TRUMP "The third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people."
323	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
324	0	TRUMP "It’s time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country."
325	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
326	0	TRUMP The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.
327	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
328	0	TRUMP "Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives."
329	0	TRUMP "Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children."
330	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
331	0	TRUMP "This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America."
332	0	TRUMP "In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration."
333	0	TRUMP "In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford."
334	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
335	0	TRUMP "It’s time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century."
336	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
337	0	TRUMP "These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system."
338	0	TRUMP "For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem."
339	0	TRUMP This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.
340	0	TRUMP "Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first."
341	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
342	0	TRUMP "So let’s come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done."
343	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
344	0	TRUMP These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.
345	0	TRUMP Never before has it been like it is now.
346	0	TRUMP It is terrible.
347	0	TRUMP We have to do something about it.
348	0	TRUMP "In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses — 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour."
349	0	TRUMP We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.
350	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
351	0	TRUMP "My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt."

353	0	TRUMP We will prevail.
354	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
355	0	TRUMP "As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America."
356	0	TRUMP We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.
357	0	TRUMP "Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department."
358	0	TRUMP He’s here tonight with his wife Rebecca.
359	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
360	0	TRUMP "Thank you, Ryan."
361	0	TRUMP "Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin."
362	0	TRUMP "When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep."
363	0	TRUMP "She told him she didn’t know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby."
364	0	TRUMP "In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: ""You will do it, because you can."""
365	0	TRUMP He heard those words.
366	0	TRUMP He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.
367	0	TRUMP "Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca."
368	0	TRUMP "In an instant, she agreed to adopt."
369	0	TRUMP The Holets named their new daughter Hope.
370	0	TRUMP "Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our nation."
371	0	TRUMP Thank you.
372	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
373	0	TRUMP "Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca."
374	1	TRUMP "As we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad."
375	0	TRUMP "Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values."
376	0	TRUMP "In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense."
377	0	TRUMP "For this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military."
378	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
379	0	TRUMP "As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else."
380	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
381	0	TRUMP "Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons."
382	0	TRUMP "Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly."
383	0	TRUMP "Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth."
384	0	TRUMP "One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations, as well."
385	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
386	0	TRUMP But there is much more work to be done.
387	0	TRUMP We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.
388	0	TRUMP Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.
389	0	TRUMP "Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely."
390	0	TRUMP "Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion."
391	0	TRUMP "Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape."
392	0	TRUMP He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.
393	0	TRUMP "He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery."
394	0	TRUMP Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin’s selfless love for his fellow warrior.
395	0	TRUMP "Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas."
396	0	TRUMP Raqqa is liberated.
397	0	TRUMP "And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a ""V"" for ""valor."""
398	0	TRUMP "Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you."
399	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
400	0	TRUMP Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.
401	0	TRUMP "When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them."
402	0	TRUMP "When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them."
403	0	TRUMP But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals.
404	0	TRUMP They are unlawful enemy combatants.
405	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
406	0	TRUMP "And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are."
407	0	TRUMP "In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield — including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released."
408	0	TRUMP "So today, I’m keeping another promise."
409	0	TRUMP "I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great job, thank you —"
410	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
411	0	TRUMP — to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay.
412	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
413	0	TRUMP "I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them."
414	0	TRUMP "And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay."
415	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
416	0	TRUMP "At the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement."
417	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
418	0	TRUMP "Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans."

421	0	TRUMP Senate just months before.
422	0	TRUMP I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
423	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
424	0	TRUMP "Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this decision."
425	0	TRUMP "In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid."
426	0	TRUMP "That is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America."
427	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
428	0	TRUMP "As we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries."
429	0	TRUMP "When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent."
430	0	TRUMP America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.
431	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
432	0	TRUMP I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.
433	0	TRUMP My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.
434	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
435	0	TRUMP But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.
436	0	TRUMP North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.
437	0	TRUMP We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.
438	0	TRUMP Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.
439	0	TRUMP I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.
440	0	TRUMP We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.
441	0	TRUMP Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia — and a great student he was.
442	0	TRUMP "On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea."
443	0	TRUMP "At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state."
444	0	TRUMP "After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death."
445	0	TRUMP He passed away just days after his return.
446	0	TRUMP "Otto’s wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta."
447	0	TRUMP Please.
448	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
449	0	TRUMP Incredible people.

457	0	TRUMP "Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime."
458	0	TRUMP His name is Mr.
459	0	TRUMP Ji Seong-ho.
460	0	TRUMP "In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea."
461	0	TRUMP "One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get."
462	0	TRUMP "In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger."
463	0	TRUMP He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.
464	0	TRUMP He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt.
465	0	TRUMP "His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth."
466	0	TRUMP "Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China."
467	0	TRUMP His tormentors wanted to know if he’d met any Christians.
468	0	TRUMP "He had — and he resolved, after that, to be free."
469	0	TRUMP Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.
470	0	TRUMP Most of his family followed.
471	0	TRUMP His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.
472	0	TRUMP "Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth."
473	0	TRUMP "Today, he has a new leg."
474	0	TRUMP "But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you’ve come."
475	0	TRUMP Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.
476	0	TRUMP Please.
477	0	TRUMP Thank you.
478	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
479	0	TRUMP Seong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.
480	0	TRUMP It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.
481	0	TRUMP It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.
482	0	TRUMP "It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world."
483	0	TRUMP That is what our country has always been about.
484	0	TRUMP "That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done."
485	0	TRUMP Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.
486	0	TRUMP "She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her."
487	0	TRUMP "Monuments to Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and King."
488	0	TRUMP "Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia."
489	0	TRUMP And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one.
490	0	TRUMP This Capitol — this living monument — this is the moment to the American people.
491	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
492	0	AUDIENCE USA!
493	0	AUDIENCE USA!
494	0	AUDIENCE USA!

496	0	TRUMP They work in every trade.
497	0	TRUMP They sacrifice to raise a family.
498	0	TRUMP They care for our children at home.
499	0	TRUMP They defend our flag abroad.
500	0	TRUMP And they are strong moms and brave kids.
501	0	TRUMP "They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and Marines."
502	0	TRUMP "But above all else, they are Americans."
503	0	TRUMP "And this Capitol, this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them."
504	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
505	0	TRUMP "Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them."
506	0	TRUMP Americans fill the world with art and music.
507	0	TRUMP They push the bounds of science and discovery.
508	0	TRUMP "And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country."
509	0	TRUMP The people built this country.
510	0	TRUMP And it’s the people who are making America great again.
511	0	SYSTEM (APPLAUSE)
512	0	TRUMP "As long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve."
513	0	TRUMP "As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail."
514	0	TRUMP Our families will thrive.
515	0	TRUMP Our people will prosper.
516	0	TRUMP And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.
517	0	TRUMP Thank you.

41	0	TRUMP It's being investigated.

55	0	LESLEY STAHL What are you options?
56	0	LESLEY STAHL Let's say they did.
57	0	LESLEY STAHL What are your options?
58	0	LESLEY STAHL "Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?"
59	0	TRUMP "Well, it depends on what the sanction is."
60	0	TRUMP I'll give ya an example.

94	0	TRUMP "It's always so far, til everything's done."
95	0	TRUMP "I-- I-- you know, deals are deals, okay?"
96	0	TRUMP "Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter."
97	0	TRUMP But I will say this.
98	0	TRUMP "The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea."
99	0	TRUMP I sat with President Obama--
100	0	LESLEY STAHL We were goin' to war?
101	0	TRUMP NAME?
102	0	TRUMP "And my impression is-- and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get."
103	0	TRUMP Doesn't get any tougher than that.
104	0	TRUMP Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough.
105	0	TRUMP We were going to war with North Korea.
106	0	TRUMP "Now, you don't hear that."
107	0	TRUMP You don't hear any talk of it.
108	1	TRUMP "And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it."
109	1	TRUMP "And you see that, he's agreed to it."
110	0	TRUMP No missiles.
111	0	LESLEY STAHL Do you trust him?
112	0	TRUMP "I do trust him, yeah, I trust him."
113	0	TRUMP That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong --
114	0	LESLEY STAHL Why would--
115	0	TRUMP about it?
116	0	LESLEY STAHL you trust him?
117	0	TRUMP "Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you."
118	0	TRUMP "Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes--"
119	0	LESLEY STAHL "Well, remember what Reagan said."
120	0	LESLEY STAHL "Trust, but verify."
121	0	TRUMP Sure.
122	0	TRUMP I know.
123	0	TRUMP It's-- it's very true.
124	0	TRUMP "But the fact is, I do trust him."
125	0	TRUMP But we'll see what happens.
126	0	LESLEY STAHL "But is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles-"
127	0	TRUMP They want to--
128	0	LESLEY STAHL With nuclear--
129	0	TRUMP And I will tell you that they're closing up sites.
130	0	LESLEY STAHL But--
131	0	TRUMP Setting it up.
132	0	LESLEY STAHL "Is what I said true, that they haven't?"
133	0	LESLEY STAHL Gotten--
134	0	TRUMP "Well, nobody really knows."
135	0	TRUMP "I mean, people are saying that."
136	0	TRUMP I've actually said that.
137	0	LESLEY STAHL What?
138	0	LESLEY STAHL "That they're still building missiles, more missiles?"
139	0	TRUMP "We don't really know, Lesley."
140	0	TRUMP We really don't know.
141	0	TRUMP But I assume--
142	0	LESLEY STAHL Suspect that?
143	0	TRUMP "Let's say the answer is yes, okay?"
144	0	TRUMP "In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile."
145	0	TRUMP They haven't tested a rocket.
146	0	TRUMP They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast.
147	0	TRUMP It sort of moves the earth.
148	0	TRUMP And we have a relationship now.
149	0	LESLEY STAHL One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions.
150	0	TRUMP We haven't done that.
151	0	LESLEY STAHL Are you prepared to do that?
152	0	LESLEY STAHL What-- what does he have to do--
153	0	TRUMP "No, no."
154	0	TRUMP I--
155	0	LESLEY STAHL Before you're--
156	0	TRUMP No I'm not doing it.
157	0	TRUMP This isn't the Obama administration.
158	0	TRUMP I haven't eased the sanctions.
159	0	TRUMP I haven't done anything.
160	0	TRUMP I haven't done anything.
161	0	TRUMP We're meeting.
162	0	TRUMP I believe he likes me.
163	0	TRUMP I like him.
164	0	TRUMP We have a good relationship.
165	0	TRUMP It's very important.
166	0	LESLEY STAHL "I wanna read you his resume, okay?"
167	0	LESLEY STAHL "He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation-- reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions."
168	0	LESLEY STAHL This is a guy you love?
169	0	TRUMP Sure.
170	0	TRUMP I know all these things.
171	0	TRUMP I mean-- I'm not a baby.
172	0	TRUMP I know these things.
173	0	LESLEY STAHL "I know, but why do you love that guy?"
174	0	TRUMP "Look, look."
175	0	TRUMP "I-- I-- I like-- I get along with him, okay?"
176	0	LESLEY STAHL But you love him.
177	0	TRUMP Okay.
178	0	TRUMP That's just a figure of speech.
179	0	LESLEY STAHL "No, it's like an embrace."
180	0	TRUMP "It well, let it be an embrace."
181	0	TRUMP Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.
182	0	LESLEY STAHL He's a bad guy.
183	0	TRUMP Look.
184	0	TRUMP Let it be whatever it is.
185	0	TRUMP I get along with him really well.
186	0	TRUMP I have a good energy with him.
187	0	TRUMP I have a good chemistry with him.
188	0	TRUMP Look at the horrible threats that were made.
189	0	TRUMP No more threats.
190	0	TRUMP No more threats.
191	0	LESLEY STAHL China.
192	0	TRUMP I get along with him.
193	0	TRUMP It's very important.
194	0	TRUMP "China, let's go."
195	0	LESLEY STAHL I'm skipping across the world here.
196	0	LESLEY STAHL You've slapped a lot of tariffs--
197	0	TRUMP $250 billion.
198	0	LESLEY STAHL Gonna do more?
199	0	TRUMP Might.
200	0	TRUMP Might.
201	0	LESLEY STAHL Round three?
202	0	TRUMP "They wanna negotiate, Lesley."
203	0	TRUMP They wanna negotiate.
204	0	LESLEY STAHL Are you ready?
205	0	TRUMP Look.
206	0	LESLEY STAHL Are you ready to--
207	0	TRUMP I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China.
208	0	TRUMP I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue.
209	1	TRUMP I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.
210	0	LESLEY STAHL And how-- how--
211	0	TRUMP "And I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore."
212	0	LESLEY STAHL How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?
213	0	TRUMP Okay.
214	0	TRUMP Okay.
215	0	TRUMP "So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case."
216	0	LESLEY STAHL Some--
217	0	TRUMP "--if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%."
218	0	LESLEY STAHL But they've--
219	0	TRUMP NAME?
220	0	LESLEY STAHL NAME?
221	0	LESLEY STAHL That's what I'm asking.
222	0	TRUMP "They can retaliate, but they can't-- they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate."
223	0	TRUMP We do $100 billion with them.
224	1	TRUMP They do $531 billion with us.
225	0	LESLEY STAHL Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?
226	0	TRUMP "No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929."
227	0	LESLEY STAHL Well that's what I'm asking.
228	0	TRUMP I don't want that.
229	0	TRUMP "No, I don't want that."
230	0	TRUMP I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us.
231	0	TRUMP I want them to open their markets like our-- our markets are open.
232	0	LESLEY STAHL But you're in a--
233	0	TRUMP And it will be a fair deal--
234	0	LESLEY STAHL NAME?
235	0	LESLEY STAHL Trade war.
236	0	TRUMP "You call it war, I don't call--"
237	0	LESLEY STAHL You-- you--
238	0	TRUMP --it--
239	0	LESLEY STAHL NAME?
240	0	TRUMP I called it a skirmish.
241	0	LESLEY STAHL "I heard you, you called it a war."
242	0	TRUMP "I called it, actually I called it a battle."
243	0	TRUMP "But, actually, I'm gonna lower that."
244	0	TRUMP I consider it a skirmish.
245	0	TRUMP And we're gonna win.
246	0	LESLEY STAHL You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.
247	0	TRUMP "I mean, what's an ally?"
248	0	TRUMP We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people.
249	0	TRUMP But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union.
250	0	TRUMP "The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done."
251	0	LESLEY STAHL But this is hostile.
252	0	TRUMP "And yet, they-- it's not hostile."
253	0	LESLEY STAHL It sounds hostile.
254	0	TRUMP You know what's hostile?
255	0	TRUMP The way they treat us.
256	0	TRUMP We're not hostile.
257	0	LESLEY STAHL "No, but can't you deal with--"
258	0	TRUMP We've been-- we've been--
259	0	LESLEY STAHL --them without--
260	0	TRUMP NAME?
261	0	LESLEY STAHL Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance?
262	0	TRUMP "Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine."
263	0	TRUMP But you know what?
264	1	TRUMP We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe.
265	0	TRUMP "And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade."
266	0	TRUMP They're not going to do it anymore.
267	0	TRUMP They understand that.
268	0	LESLEY STAHL "Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance?"
269	0	LESLEY STAHL It's been going for 70 years.
270	0	LESLEY STAHL It's kept the peace for 70 years.
271	0	TRUMP You don't know that.
272	0	TRUMP You don't know that.
273	0	LESLEY STAHL I don't know what?
274	0	TRUMP You don't know that.
275	0	LESLEY STAHL "Is it true General Mattis said to you, ""The reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War III?"""
276	0	TRUMP "No, it's not true."
277	0	LESLEY STAHL What's not true?
278	0	TRUMP "Frankly, I like General Mattis."
279	0	TRUMP I think I know more about it than he does.
280	0	TRUMP "And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you."
281	0	LESLEY STAHL I'm gonna try one more time.
282	0	LESLEY STAHL Okay.
283	0	TRUMP "I know-- and, Lesley, you don't have to try again."
284	0	TRUMP I know exactly what you're saying--
285	0	LESLEY STAHL "Well, answer my question."
286	0	TRUMP The answer is this.
287	0	TRUMP "I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way."
288	0	TRUMP "I'm fully in favor of NATO, but I don't wanna be taken advantage of."
289	0	LESLEY STAHL Putin.
290	0	TRUMP Yeah.
291	0	LESLEY STAHL "Okay, people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin."
292	0	TRUMP "Okay, you ready?"
293	0	LESLEY STAHL I don't understand it.
294	0	TRUMP I have been-- you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference--
295	0	LESLEY STAHL "No, I mean publicly."
296	0	LESLEY STAHL You never say anything harsh about him--
297	0	TRUMP Excuse me.
298	0	LESLEY STAHL NAME?
299	0	TRUMP I didn't?
300	0	TRUMP I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.
301	0	TRUMP Obama didn't.
302	0	TRUMP You know what he sent?
303	0	TRUMP He sent pillows and blankets.
304	0	TRUMP I'm the one-- and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this--
305	0	LESLEY STAHL "Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin--"
306	0	TRUMP I think I'm very tough with him personally.
307	0	TRUMP I had a meeting with him.
308	0	TRUMP The two of us.
309	0	TRUMP It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.
310	0	LESLEY STAHL Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?
311	0	LESLEY STAHL In poisonings?
312	0	TRUMP "Probably he is, yeah."
313	0	TRUMP Probably.
314	0	TRUMP "I mean, I don't--"
315	0	LESLEY STAHL Probably?
316	0	TRUMP "But I rely on them, it's not in our country."
317	0	LESLEY STAHL Why not-- they shouldn't do it.
318	0	LESLEY STAHL This is a terrible thing.
319	0	TRUMP Of course they shouldn't do it-
320	0	LESLEY STAHL Instead do you believe--
321	0	TRUMP That's your (Inaudible.)--
322	0	LESLEY STAHL --do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election?
323	0	LESLEY STAHL Our election-
324	1	TRUMP They-- they meddled.
325	0	TRUMP But I think China meddled too.
326	0	LESLEY STAHL But why do you--
327	0	TRUMP And I think other countries--
328	0	LESLEY STAHL NAME?
329	0	TRUMP And you wanna know something?
330	0	LESLEY STAHL Why do you say Chi-- why don't you just say--
331	0	TRUMP "Well, let me ask you--"
332	0	LESLEY STAHL NAME?
333	0	TRUMP Because I think China meddled also.
334	0	TRUMP "And I think, frankly, China--"
335	0	LESLEY STAHL This is amazing.
336	0	TRUMP NAME?
337	0	LESLEY STAHL You are diverting the whole Russia thing.
338	0	TRUMP I'm not doing anything.
339	0	LESLEY STAHL "You are, you are"
340	1	TRUMP "I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China."
341	0	LESLEY STAHL "What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?"
342	0	TRUMP "Well, we'll see what happens come midterms."
343	0	TRUMP But--
344	0	LESLEY STAHL "But everybody thinks, given the things you've said--"
345	0	TRUMP I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that.
346	0	TRUMP I was very disappointed.
347	0	TRUMP Why should he have recused himself?
348	0	TRUMP So I was very--
349	0	LESLEY STAHL So--
350	0	TRUMP --disappointed but--
351	0	LESLEY STAHL So can I assume--
352	0	TRUMP --we'll see what happens.
353	0	LESLEY STAHL Can I assume he's gone?
354	0	TRUMP No.
355	0	TRUMP No.
356	0	TRUMP You can't assume that.
357	0	LESLEY STAHL Will you.
358	0	LESLEY STAHL Will you pledge-- pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?
359	0	TRUMP "Well, I-- I don't pledge anything."
360	0	TRUMP "But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that."
361	0	TRUMP I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.
362	0	LESLEY STAHL But you won't pledge--
363	0	TRUMP There is no collusion.
364	0	TRUMP I don't wanna pledge.
365	0	TRUMP Why should I pledge to you?
366	0	TRUMP "If I pledge, I'll pledge."
367	0	TRUMP I don't have to pledge to you.
368	0	TRUMP But I have-
369	0	LESLEY STAHL Well--
370	0	TRUMP I have no intention of doing that.
371	0	TRUMP Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election?
372	0	TRUMP Give me a break.
373	1	TRUMP They wouldn't be able to help me at all.
374	0	TRUMP Call Russia.
375	0	TRUMP It's so ridiculous.
376	0	LESLEY STAHL So you've been president for almost two years.
377	0	LESLEY STAHL "Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done?"
378	0	LESLEY STAHL Do you have any regrets?
379	0	TRUMP "So when I won the presidency, I th-- I-- I-- the press treats me terribly."
380	0	TRUMP "I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great."
381	0	TRUMP "Lesley, they treat me worse."
382	0	TRUMP They got worse instead of better.
383	0	TRUMP Very dishonest.
384	0	LESLEY STAHL "Okay, this-- you're-- but you regret?"
385	0	TRUMP I regret that the press treats me so badly--
386	0	LESLEY STAHL I'm-- I'm really asking (Inaudible.)--
387	0	TRUMP "And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so."
388	0	LESLEY STAHL Have you made any mistakes?
389	0	LESLEY STAHL That's my question.
390	0	TRUMP Everybody makes mistakes.
391	0	LESLEY STAHL And what have been yours?
392	0	TRUMP I could have been-- earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal.
393	0	TRUMP "The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders."
394	0	TRUMP I was getting to know countries.
395	0	TRUMP I didn't wanna do it right outta the box.
396	0	TRUMP "So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier."
397	0	LESLEY STAHL What about the forced separation of children from their-- migrant children--
398	0	TRUMP Yeah.
399	0	TRUMP "Well, that was--"
400	0	LESLEY STAHL from the--
401	1	TRUMP the same as the Obama law.
402	1	TRUMP "You know, Obama had the same thing."
403	0	LESLEY STAHL "It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it."
404	0	LESLEY STAHL You--enforced it.
405	0	LESLEY STAHL You launched that-- the zero tolerance policy-- to deter families with children coming--
406	0	TRUMP "No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation."
407	0	TRUMP "And frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country."
408	0	LESLEY STAHL So are you gonna go back to that?
409	0	TRUMP "Well, we're looking at a lot of things."
410	0	TRUMP "Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were-- they were a laughing stock all over the world."
411	0	LESLEY STAHL Are you willing though-- I think that you're saying you're-- it's under consideration.
412	0	TRUMP "No, I want all the laws changed."
413	0	LESLEY STAHL But the children specifically--
414	0	TRUMP "there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally."
415	0	TRUMP "And part of the r-- I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States."
416	0	LESLEY STAHL "Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no."
417	0	TRUMP Go ahead.
418	0	LESLEY STAHL Are you willing to reinstitute that policy?
419	0	LESLEY STAHL "You said, ""We're looking at everything."""
420	0	TRUMP I will--
421	0	LESLEY STAHL Yes or no.
422	0	TRUMP I will only-- I can't-- you can't say yes or no.
423	0	TRUMP "What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally."
424	0	LESLEY STAHL I'm not gonna ask it again--
425	0	TRUMP You don't have to.
426	0	LESLEY STAHL cause I know you won't-- it--
427	1	TRUMP But it's the same as Obama.
428	0	LESLEY STAHL Okay.
429	0	LESLEY STAHL "Changing subjects again-- you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military."
430	0	LESLEY STAHL "You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?"
431	0	TRUMP Okay.
432	0	TRUMP "So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah."
433	0	TRUMP Now I say they're babies.
434	0	LESLEY STAHL Who's the toughest?
435	0	TRUMP "They're babies, the political people."
436	0	TRUMP "This is the most deceptive, vicious world."
437	0	TRUMP "It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception."
438	0	TRUMP You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with-- that table.
439	0	LESLEY STAHL Give me an example.
440	0	TRUMP "Well, I don't wanna give you an example."
441	0	TRUMP "I'm not lookin' to-- in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do."
442	0	TRUMP Remember that.
443	0	TRUMP "When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at-- making deals with other countries."
444	0	TRUMP Nobody's been able to do anything like this.
445	0	TRUMP "Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it."
446	0	TRUMP But it's a very deceptive world.
447	0	TRUMP The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was.
448	0	TRUMP I-- I-- and I really mean it.
449	0	TRUMP I'm not saying that as a sound bite.
450	0	TRUMP I never--
451	0	LESLEY STAHL I'd like to--
452	0	TRUMP Knew how dishonest--
453	0	LESLEY STAHL I'm-- I'm gonna change the subject again.
454	0	TRUMP "Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation."
455	0	TRUMP "When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it."
456	0	LESLEY STAHL "No, I'm gonna run your--"
457	0	TRUMP "When I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it."
458	0	LESLEY STAHL "I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so."
459	0	TRUMP I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.
460	0	LESLEY STAHL "I disagree, but I don't wanna have that fight with you."
461	0	TRUMP "Hey, it's okay--"
462	0	LESLEY STAHL "All right, I'll get in another fight with you--"
463	0	TRUMP "Lesley, it's okay."
464	0	TRUMP "In the meantime, I'm president--and you're not."
465	0	LESLEY STAHL "This country is divided, polarized."
466	0	LESLEY STAHL "Within families, there aren't even people who can talk to each other."
467	0	LESLEY STAHL "What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and--"
468	0	TRUMP Yeah-- I think that--
469	0	LESLEY STAHL NAME?
470	0	TRUMP --what's going to happen-- I think the economy's bringing people together.

21	0	TRUMP It’s been very much of a one-way street.
22	0	TRUMP "So, that’s happening."
23	0	TRUMP "And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country."
24	0	TRUMP They haven’t respected us for a long time.
25	0	TRUMP Not for a long time.
26	0	TRUMP "The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we’re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement."
27	0	TRUMP "You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems."
28	0	TRUMP "But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that’s just been strengthened further."
29	0	TRUMP "So with the UK, we’re continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by."
30	0	TRUMP "We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States."
31	0	TRUMP "The relationship there, also, is very good."
32	0	TRUMP We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.
33	0	TRUMP And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.
34	0	TRUMP And many other things.
35	0	TRUMP A lot of positive things are going on.
36	0	TRUMP We’re working on a summit.
37	0	TRUMP And you know all about the summit.
38	0	TRUMP It will be in Vietnam — Hanoi.
39	0	TRUMP And we will — we’ll be meeting in Hanoi.
40	0	TRUMP We’ll be meeting in Hanoi.
41	0	TRUMP "I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect."
42	0	TRUMP And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.
43	0	TRUMP A lot was done in the first summit.
44	0	TRUMP No more rockets going up.
45	0	TRUMP No more missiles going up.
46	0	TRUMP No more testing of nuclear.
47	0	TRUMP "Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War."
48	0	TRUMP And we got back our hostages.
49	0	TRUMP But we hope we’re going to be very much equally as successful.
50	0	TRUMP I’m in no rush for speed.
51	0	TRUMP We just don’t want testing.
52	0	TRUMP "The sanctions, as you know, remain."
53	0	TRUMP Everything is remaining.
54	0	TRUMP "China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us."
55	0	TRUMP "And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we’ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan."
56	0	TRUMP "But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing."
57	0	TRUMP And that’s okay — as per the United Nations.
58	0	TRUMP "So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one."
59	0	TRUMP I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.
60	0	TRUMP "We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States."
61	0	TRUMP They have really taken advantage of the United States.
62	0	TRUMP Billions of dollars has been paid to them.
63	0	TRUMP And we won’t let that happen.
64	0	TRUMP "But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power."
65	0	TRUMP Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China — right smack in the middle — is phenomenal.
66	0	TRUMP And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.
67	0	TRUMP So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.
68	0	TRUMP "Today, I’m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home."
69	0	TRUMP "We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases."
70	0	TRUMP But we don’t control our own border.
71	0	TRUMP So we’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.
72	0	TRUMP "And we’re going to do it one way or the other — we have to do it — not because it was a campaign promise, which it is."
73	0	TRUMP "It was one of many, by the way; not my only one."
74	0	TRUMP "We’re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before."
75	0	TRUMP "You look at other economies — they’re doing terribly, and we’re doing phenomenally."
76	0	TRUMP "The market is up tremendously today, not that that’s anything, but, you know — because I’ll go back in and they’ll say, ""Oh, the market just went down."""
77	0	TRUMP But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.
78	0	TRUMP We have all the records.
79	0	TRUMP We have every record.
80	0	TRUMP But we’re getting close to that point again where we’ll create new records.
81	0	TRUMP "So our country is doing very well, economically."
82	0	TRUMP And we’ve done a lot.
83	0	TRUMP "But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border."
84	1	TRUMP "When you look and when you listen to politicians — in particular, certain Democrats — they say it all comes through the port of entry."
85	0	TRUMP It’s wrong.
86	0	TRUMP It’s wrong.
87	0	TRUMP It’s just a lie.
88	0	TRUMP It’s all a lie.
89	0	TRUMP They say walls don’t work.
90	1	TRUMP Walls work 100 percent.
91	0	TRUMP "Whether it’s El Paso — I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso — we had a tremendous crowd, and — tremendous crowd."
92	0	TRUMP "And I asked the people — many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas."
93	0	TRUMP And I asked them.
94	0	TRUMP "I said, ""Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?"""
95	0	TRUMP "You were there, some of you."
96	1	TRUMP It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.
97	0	TRUMP You know what they did.
98	0	TRUMP But that’s only one example.
99	0	TRUMP There are so many examples.
100	1	TRUMP "In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall."
101	0	TRUMP And they had 23 murders.
102	1	TRUMP "It’s a lot of murders, but it’s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico."
103	1	TRUMP So everyone knows that walls work.
104	0	TRUMP "And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly."
105	0	TRUMP You just take a look.
106	0	TRUMP Almost everywhere.
107	0	TRUMP Take a look at Israel.
108	0	TRUMP They’re building another wall.
109	0	TRUMP "Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me — 99.9 percent."
110	0	TRUMP "That’s what it would be with us, too."
111	0	TRUMP The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.
112	0	TRUMP They go around the wall and in.
113	0	TRUMP Okay?
114	0	TRUMP That’s what it is.
115	0	TRUMP It’s very simple.
116	0	TRUMP And a big majority of the big drugs — the big drug loads — don’t go through ports of entry.
117	0	TRUMP They can’t go through ports of entry.
118	0	TRUMP "You can’t take big loads because you have people — we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement — looking."
119	0	TRUMP You can’t take human traffic — women and girls — you can’t take them through ports of entry.
120	0	TRUMP You can’t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.
121	0	TRUMP They open the door.
122	0	TRUMP They look.
123	0	TRUMP They can’t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.
124	0	TRUMP They go through areas where you have no wall.
125	0	TRUMP Everybody knows that.
126	0	TRUMP Nancy knows it.
127	0	TRUMP Chuck knows it.
128	0	TRUMP They all know it.
129	0	TRUMP It’s all a big lie.
130	0	TRUMP It’s a big con game.
131	0	TRUMP "You don’t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that’s it."
132	0	TRUMP "They can’t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there’s no barrier, and they come into the United States."
133	0	TRUMP Welcome.
134	0	TRUMP We’ve detained more people.
135	0	TRUMP Our border agents are doing such incredible work.
136	0	TRUMP Our military has been incredible.
137	0	TRUMP We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.
138	0	TRUMP We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.
139	0	TRUMP It’s very successful.
140	0	TRUMP "But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them."
141	0	TRUMP And it’s very necessary.
142	0	TRUMP We’ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.
143	0	TRUMP They just are breaking.
144	0	TRUMP They’re in the process of breaking up.
145	0	TRUMP We have another one that we haven’t been able to break up yet.
146	0	TRUMP We’ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.
147	0	TRUMP I want to thank the President.
148	0	TRUMP I want to thank Mexico.
149	0	TRUMP They have their own problems.
150	0	TRUMP "They have the largest number of murders that they’ve ever had in their history — almost 40,000 murders."
151	0	TRUMP Forty thousand.
152	0	TRUMP "And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will."
153	0	TRUMP "But I just want to thank the President, because he’s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up."
154	0	TRUMP "We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people."
155	0	TRUMP It’s largely broken up.
156	0	TRUMP Others have gotten through.
157	0	TRUMP "And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there."
158	0	TRUMP "If we didn’t have the wall up, and if we didn’t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they’d be welcomed to the United States."
159	0	TRUMP One of the things we’d save tremendous — just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.
160	0	TRUMP "If we had a wall, we don’t need the military because we’d have a wall."
161	0	TRUMP So I’m going to be signing a national emergency.
162	0	TRUMP And it’s been signed many times before.
163	0	TRUMP It’s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.
164	0	TRUMP It gave the Presidents the power.
165	0	TRUMP There’s rarely been a problem.
166	0	TRUMP They sign it; nobody cares.
167	0	TRUMP I guess they weren’t very exciting.
168	0	TRUMP But nobody cares.
169	0	TRUMP "They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases."
170	1	TRUMP "We’re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs."
171	0	TRUMP We have some of the greatest people I know.
172	0	TRUMP They’ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign — almost from the first week.
173	0	TRUMP The Angel Moms.
174	0	TRUMP "Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms."
175	0	TRUMP "One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who — we’re talking about killed, in the year of ’18."
176	0	TRUMP "I said, ""I haven’t seen you before."""
177	0	TRUMP "She said, ""No, I’m new."""
178	0	TRUMP "I said, ""That’s too bad."""
179	0	TRUMP It’s too bad.
180	0	TRUMP It’s so sad.
181	0	TRUMP "Stand up, just for a second."
182	0	TRUMP Show how beautiful your girl was.
183	0	TRUMP Thank you.
184	0	TRUMP I have such respect for these people.
185	0	TRUMP "Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families."
186	0	TRUMP I have great respect for these people.
187	0	TRUMP These are great people.
188	0	TRUMP These are great people.
189	0	TRUMP They’re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.
190	0	TRUMP "And the press doesn’t cover them; they don’t want to, incredibly."
191	0	TRUMP And they’re not treated the way they should be.
192	0	TRUMP They’re fighting for other people because they don’t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.
193	0	TRUMP "We have one young lady whose husband — please, stand up."
194	0	TRUMP Your husband was just killed in Maryland.
195	0	TRUMP Incredible man.
196	0	TRUMP Just killed.
197	0	TRUMP Beautiful children — won’t be seeing their father again.
198	0	TRUMP These are brave people.
199	0	TRUMP These are people that — they don’t have to be here.
200	0	TRUMP They don’t have to be doing this.
201	0	TRUMP They’re doing it for other people.
202	0	TRUMP "So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?"
203	0	TRUMP I really do.
204	0	TRUMP I want to thank you.
205	0	TRUMP Incredible people.
206	0	TRUMP "Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least — I think the number is ridiculously low — by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl."
207	0	TRUMP "And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit — before I even started talking about the trade — it was a trade meeting."
208	0	TRUMP "It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important."
209	0	TRUMP "I said, ""Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country. It kills tens of thousands of people — I think far more than anybody registers. And I’d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list."""
210	0	TRUMP And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.
211	0	TRUMP Their criminal list — a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.
212	0	TRUMP "Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, ""How about a fine?"""
213	0	TRUMP "And when I asked President Xi, I said, ""Do you have a drug problem?"""
214	0	TRUMP "No, no, no. I said, ""You have 1.4 billion people. What do you mean you have no drug problem?"""
215	0	TRUMP "No, we don’t have a drug problem.  I said, ""Why?"" ""Death penalty. We give death penalty to people that sell drugs."""
216	0	TRUMP End of problem.
217	0	TRUMP What do we do?
218	0	TRUMP We set up blue ribbon committees.
219	0	TRUMP "Lovely men and women — they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time."
220	0	TRUMP "So if we want to get smart, we can get smart."
221	0	TRUMP You can end the drug problem.
222	0	TRUMP You can end it a lot faster than you think.
223	0	TRUMP "But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs."
224	0	TRUMP And it’s a criminal penalty.
225	0	TRUMP And the penalty is death.
226	0	TRUMP "So that’s, frankly, one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth."
227	0	TRUMP I think maybe there’s no more important point.
228	0	TRUMP We’re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.
229	0	TRUMP "It’s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope."
230	0	TRUMP Their market is down close to 40 percent.
231	0	TRUMP Our market is way up.
232	0	TRUMP "We’ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth."
233	0	TRUMP Trillions.
234	0	TRUMP Many trillions.
235	0	TRUMP And China has lost trillions of dollars.
236	0	TRUMP But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.
237	0	TRUMP So we’ll see what happens.
238	0	TRUMP "China is coming here next week, by the way."
239	0	TRUMP "They’re coming home, the traders."
240	0	TRUMP And then China is coming here next week.
241	0	TRUMP And then I’ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe — for some remaining deals.
242	0	TRUMP "We’ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves."
243	0	TRUMP "So, we’re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency."
244	1	TRUMP "And it’s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it’s unacceptable."
245	0	TRUMP "And by signing the national emergency — something signed many times by other Presidents — many, many times."
246	0	TRUMP "President Obama — in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels."
247	0	TRUMP Criminal cartels.
248	0	TRUMP It’s a very good emergency that he signed.
249	0	TRUMP And we’re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.
250	0	TRUMP So that would be a second national emergency.
251	0	TRUMP "But, in that case, it’s already in place."
252	0	TRUMP And what we want — really want to do — is simple.
253	0	TRUMP It’s not like it’s complicated.
254	0	TRUMP It’s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.
255	0	TRUMP We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.
256	0	TRUMP Nobody has done the job that we’ve ever done.
257	0	TRUMP "I mean, nobody has done the job that we’ve done on the border."
258	0	TRUMP "And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy — and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes."
259	0	TRUMP "You know, I hear a lot of people say, ""Oh, well. But maybe the previous administration…"""
260	0	TRUMP "Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast."
261	0	TRUMP We would have been down the tubes.
262	0	TRUMP The regulations were strangling our country.
263	0	TRUMP Unnecessary regulations.
264	0	TRUMP By creating such a strong economy — you just look at your televisions or see what’s going on today; it’s through the roof.
265	1	TRUMP "What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before."
266	0	TRUMP "And we’ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but it’s a massive number of people."
267	0	TRUMP "If we had the wall, it would be very easy."
268	0	TRUMP We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.
269	0	TRUMP "We wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row."
270	0	TRUMP You wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent.
271	0	TRUMP "We would get — we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol."
272	0	TRUMP "You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things."
273	0	TRUMP Law enforcement and Border Patrol.
274	0	TRUMP "And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE."
275	0	TRUMP ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.
276	0	TRUMP "And, by the way, we’re going to be taking care of ICE."
277	0	TRUMP "You know, we talk about the new bill."
278	0	TRUMP We’re going to be taking care of ICE.
279	0	TRUMP They wanted to get rid of ICE.
280	0	TRUMP And the bill is just the opposite of that.
281	0	TRUMP A lot of good things happened.
282	0	TRUMP "So, that’s the story."
283	0	TRUMP We want to have a safe country.
284	0	TRUMP "I ran on a very simple slogan: ""Make America Great Again."""
285	1	TRUMP "If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again."
286	0	TRUMP "But we’ve done a fantastic job, but we haven’t been given the equipment."
287	0	TRUMP We haven’t been given the walls.
288	0	TRUMP "And in the bill, by the way, they didn’t even fight us on most of the stuff."
289	0	TRUMP Ports of entry.
290	0	TRUMP "We have so much money, we don’t know what to do with it."
291	0	TRUMP I don’t know what to do with all the money they’re giving us.
292	0	TRUMP It’s crazy.
293	0	TRUMP "The only place they don’t want to give as much money — $1,375,000,000."
294	0	TRUMP "Sounds like a lot, but it’s not so much, although we’re putting it to much better use than it used to be."
295	0	TRUMP "A lot of the past administrations, they had — it was easy to get, and they didn’t build or they didn’t do what they could have done."
296	0	TRUMP It would have been great.
297	0	TRUMP "It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession."
298	0	TRUMP And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.
299	0	TRUMP People that should have stepped up did not step up.
300	0	TRUMP "They didn’t step up, and they should have."
301	0	TRUMP Would have been easy.
302	0	TRUMP "Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier."
303	0	TRUMP But some people didn’t step up.
304	0	TRUMP But we’re stepping up now.
305	0	TRUMP So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.
306	0	TRUMP "Whether it’s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it’s going to build a lot of wall."
307	0	TRUMP We’re getting it done.
308	0	TRUMP We’re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.
309	0	TRUMP "And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new."
310	0	TRUMP That’s where a lot of the money has been spent — on renovation.
311	0	TRUMP "In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay."
312	0	TRUMP But we’re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.
313	0	TRUMP So — and we need new wall.
314	0	TRUMP So I want to thank everybody for being here.
315	0	TRUMP "I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here."
316	0	TRUMP Thank you very much.
317	0	TRUMP We have great respect for you.
318	0	TRUMP "The real country, our real country — the people that really love our country, they love you."
319	0	TRUMP So I just want you to know that.
320	0	TRUMP I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you’re having.
321	0	TRUMP I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.
322	0	TRUMP "Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly."
323	0	TRUMP And we’re giving you a lot of surplus.
324	0	TRUMP "We’re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn’t like giving, previous to this administration."
325	0	TRUMP But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.
326	0	TRUMP "And as we get it, as you know, we send it down."
327	0	TRUMP And you have much better protection.
328	0	TRUMP But I really appreciate you being here.
329	0	TRUMP So the order is signed.
330	0	TRUMP And I’ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.
331	0	TRUMP "And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there."
332	0	TRUMP "And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling."
333	0	TRUMP "And then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake."
334	0	TRUMP "And we’ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban."
335	0	TRUMP "They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won."
336	0	TRUMP "And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban."
337	0	TRUMP Because we have a ban.
338	0	TRUMP It’s very helpful.
339	0	TRUMP "Madam Secretary, is that right?"
340	0	TRUMP "Without the ban, we’d have a bigger problem."
341	0	TRUMP "We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what’s going on in the world."
342	0	TRUMP And we won.
343	0	TRUMP "But somebody said, ""President Trump lost on the ban."""
344	0	TRUMP "Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court."
345	0	TRUMP He — he didn’t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.
346	0	TRUMP They didn’t want to say that.
347	0	TRUMP They didn’t want to go that far.
348	0	TRUMP They were saying how I lost.
349	0	TRUMP "The person sitting right up here — ""Donald Trump lost on the ban."""
350	0	TRUMP "Yeah, I did."
351	0	TRUMP "And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too."
352	0	TRUMP And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.
353	0	TRUMP Didn’t want to take it that far.
354	0	TRUMP "But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too."
355	0	TRUMP "The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we’re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs."
356	0	TRUMP "And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters."
357	0	TRUMP Thousands.
358	0	TRUMP They’re out of this country.
359	0	TRUMP We take them out by the thousands.
360	0	TRUMP And they are monsters.
361	0	TRUMP Okay.
362	0	TRUMP Do you have any questions?
363	0	TRUMP Yeah.

365	0	QUESTION Mr. President — (inaudible).
366	0	QUESTION "AIDE:  Yes, we do."
367	0	QUESTION There you go.
368	0	QUESTION You were prepared.
369	0	QUESTION "Mr. President, a lot of the money —"
370	0	TRUMP Were you saying I was prepared?
371	0	QUESTION With the microphone and prepared for questions.
372	0	TRUMP "Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared."
373	0	TRUMP I couldn’t believe you said that.
374	0	QUESTION (LAUGHTER)
375	0	QUESTION "No, no, no."
376	0	QUESTION (LAUGHTER)
377	0	TRUMP People don’t like saying that.
378	0	QUESTION You were prepared for questions.
379	0	TRUMP I am prepared.
380	0	TRUMP I’m always prepared.
381	0	QUESTION A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that’s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.
382	0	QUESTION "How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?"
383	0	TRUMP Yeah.
384	0	TRUMP "So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military."
385	0	TRUMP "Some of them haven’t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important."
386	0	TRUMP I was speaking to a couple of them.
387	0	TRUMP They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.
388	0	TRUMP "I said, ""What were you going to use it for?"""
389	0	TRUMP "And I won’t go into details, but it didn’t sound too important to me."
390	0	TRUMP "Plus, if you think, I’ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion."
391	0	TRUMP "And we’re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot."
392	0	TRUMP "And under the previous administration, our military was depleted — badly depleted."
393	0	TRUMP "And they weren’t spending — I mean, they had a much less — they had a much smaller amount of money."
394	0	TRUMP "So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion — and this year, it’s going to be pretty big too, because there’s few things more important than our military."
395	0	TRUMP "You know, I’m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military."
396	0	TRUMP It was very badly depleted.
397	0	TRUMP "And we’re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment."
398	0	TRUMP We have — we’ll soon have a military like we’ve never had before.
399	0	TRUMP "But when you think about the kind of numbers you’re talking about — so you have $700 billion, $716 billion — when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall — which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in."
400	0	TRUMP "And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs."
401	0	TRUMP "And that’s part of it, too."
402	0	TRUMP We’re taking a lot of money from that realm also.
403	0	TRUMP "But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we’re asking for."
404	0	TRUMP "Yeah, go ahead."
405	0	TRUMP Go ahead.
406	0	TRUMP ABC.
407	0	TRUMP Not NBC.
408	0	TRUMP I like ABC a little bit more — not much.
409	0	TRUMP "Come on, ABC."
410	0	TRUMP Not much.
411	0	TRUMP Pretty close.
412	0	QUESTION "Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?"
413	0	QUESTION Marco Rubio has made this point.
414	0	TRUMP "Well, not too many people."
415	0	TRUMP Yeah.
416	0	TRUMP Not too many people have said that.
417	0	TRUMP But the courts will determine that.
418	0	TRUMP "Look, I expect to be sued."
419	0	TRUMP I shouldn’t be sued.
420	0	TRUMP Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.
421	0	TRUMP "And then other people say, ""Oh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?"""
422	0	TRUMP We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.
423	1	TRUMP It’s an invasion.
424	1	TRUMP "We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it’s very hard to stop."
425	0	TRUMP "With a wall, it would be very easy."
426	0	TRUMP So I think that we will be very successful in court.
427	0	TRUMP I think it’s clear.
428	0	TRUMP "And the people that say we create precedent — well, what do you have?"
429	0	TRUMP Fifty-six?
430	0	TRUMP "There are a lot of times — well, that’s creating precedent."
431	0	TRUMP And many of those are far less important than having a border.
432	0	TRUMP "If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country."
433	0	TRUMP "You know, we fight — before I got here — we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don’t create a border for our own country."
434	0	TRUMP "So I think what will happen is, sadly, we’ll be sued, and sadly, it’ll go through a process."
435	0	TRUMP "And, happily, we’ll win — I think."
436	0	TRUMP Go ahead.
437	0	TRUMP Let’s go.
438	0	TRUMP "Let’s hear it, NBC."
439	0	TRUMP Come on.
440	0	QUESTION "Thank you, Mr. President."
441	0	QUESTION "I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, ""The whole concept of executive order, it’s not the way the country is supposed to be run."""
442	0	QUESTION "You said, ""You’re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal."""
443	0	QUESTION "Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you’re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown?"
444	0	TRUMP No.
445	0	TRUMP "Look, I went through Congress."
446	0	TRUMP I made a deal.
447	0	TRUMP I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn’t supposed to get one dollar — not one dollar.
448	0	TRUMP He’s not going to get one dollar.
449	0	TRUMP "Well, I got $1.4 billion."
450	0	TRUMP But I’m not happy with it.
451	0	TRUMP "I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things — port of entries, lots of different things."
452	0	TRUMP The purchase of drug equipment.
453	0	TRUMP More than we were even requesting.
454	0	TRUMP "In fact, the primary fight was on the wall."
455	0	TRUMP "Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don’t know what to do with it we have so much money."
456	0	TRUMP "But on the wall, they skimped."
457	0	TRUMP "So I did — I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster."
458	0	TRUMP I could do the wall over a longer period of time.
459	0	TRUMP I didn’t need to do this.
460	0	TRUMP But I’d rather do it much faster.
461	0	TRUMP And I don’t have to do it for the election.
462	1	TRUMP "I’ve already done a lot of wall, for the election — 2020."
463	0	TRUMP "And the only reason we’re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they’re not going to be able to do."
464	0	TRUMP "And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense."
465	0	TRUMP "And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that’s all."
466	0	TRUMP Okay.

471	0	QUESTION I wanted to ask about China.
472	0	QUESTION Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1?
473	0	TRUMP "Well, you know, you’re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?"
474	0	TRUMP "I mean, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China."
475	0	TRUMP "And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel — much of it comes from China — at 25 percent."
476	0	TRUMP "Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they’re building plants all over the United States."
477	0	TRUMP It’s a beautiful thing.
478	0	TRUMP "And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel."
479	0	TRUMP "You know, you can do without certain industries."
480	0	TRUMP Our country cannot do without steel.
481	0	TRUMP "So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate."
482	0	TRUMP "And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs."
483	0	TRUMP And I haven’t even started.
484	0	TRUMP "Now, here’s the thing: If we make a deal, they won’t have to pay."
485	0	TRUMP "You know, it’ll be a whole different story."
486	0	TRUMP "They won’t be paying that, but we’ll have a fair deal."
487	0	TRUMP There won’t be intellectual property theft.
488	0	TRUMP There won’t be so many other things that have gone on.
489	0	TRUMP And no other President has done this.
490	0	TRUMP "No other — you know, we didn’t have a deal with China."
491	0	TRUMP "You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made — probably even worse than NAFTA, if that’s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster."
492	0	TRUMP It was a total disaster for our country.
493	0	TRUMP "And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific — a great deal."
494	1	TRUMP "And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico — that’s United States, Mexico, Canada — that’s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall."
495	0	TRUMP And nobody wants to talk about that.
496	0	TRUMP "Because we’re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal."
497	0	TRUMP "Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because they’ll say — one of the things I’m thinking of doing — this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they’ve built over the last two years — which is a lot — and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, ""What a lousy deal; that’s a terrible deal."""
498	0	TRUMP "Like, ZTE, I got a billion — more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time."

500	0	TRUMP "When I made that deal, I said, ""This is incredible."""
501	0	TRUMP "I just got — I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors."
502	0	TRUMP They had to change their top management.
503	0	TRUMP But they had to pay over a billion dollars.
504	0	TRUMP "I said, ""What a deal."""
505	0	TRUMP It took like a week.
506	0	TRUMP And the Democrats didn’t even know there was a problem with ZTE.
507	0	TRUMP I’m the one that find them.
508	0	TRUMP I’m the one that settled it.
509	0	TRUMP Over a billion dollars.
510	0	TRUMP And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.
511	0	TRUMP "And we made a deal — paid — like, in a short period of time."
512	0	TRUMP "The Democrats went out and said, ""Oh, they should’ve done better."""
513	0	TRUMP "So what I’m thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives."
514	0	TRUMP "And we’ll all go down together, and what we’ll do is we’ll negotiate."
515	0	TRUMP I’ll put them in the room and let them speak up.
516	0	TRUMP "Because any deal I make with China, if it’s the great — it’s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I’m not going to have a deal."
517	0	TRUMP It’s a very simple.
518	0	TRUMP "But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, ""Oh, it should’ve been better. It should’ve been better."" "
519	0	TRUMP And you know what?
520	0	TRUMP That’s not acceptable to me.
521	0	TRUMP So I’m thinking about doing something very different.
522	0	TRUMP I don’t think it’s ever been — I just don’t want to be second-guessed.
523	0	TRUMP But that’s not even second-guess; that’s called politics.
524	0	TRUMP "Sadly, I’d probably do the same thing to them, okay?"
525	0	TRUMP "But any deal I make toward the end, I’m going to bring Schumer — at least offer him — and Pelosi."
526	0	TRUMP "I’m going to say, ""Please join me on the deal."""

560	0	TRUMP "And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that’s something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform — not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things."

567	0	TRUMP "That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured — nobody talks about that — horribly — like, loss of legs and arms — going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York."
568	1	TRUMP He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.
569	1	TRUMP It’s called chain migration.
570	0	TRUMP And then you have the lottery.
571	1	TRUMP "It’s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in; they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery."
572	0	TRUMP It’s common sense.
573	0	TRUMP "If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I’m not going to put in my stars; I’m going to put in people I don’t want."

673	0	QUESTION "Thank you, Mr. President."
674	0	QUESTION "Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics — numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government — show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most —"
675	0	TRUMP There’s not violence on the border?
676	0	QUESTION There’s not as much violence as —
677	0	TRUMP "Oh, really?"
678	0	QUESTION Let me — wait a minute.
679	0	QUESTION Wait a minute.
680	0	QUESTION Wait —
681	0	TRUMP You had 26 people killed —
682	0	QUESTION "Let me finish the question, please."
683	0	QUESTION "Let me finish the question, please."
684	0	TRUMP "Two weeks ago, 26 people were killed in a gunfight on the border —"
685	0	QUESTION I understand what you’re — I understand what you’re saying.
686	0	TRUMP — a mile away from where I went.
687	0	QUESTION I was there.
688	0	QUESTION I understand.
689	0	QUESTION That’s not the question.
690	0	QUESTION The question is —
691	0	TRUMP Do we forget about that?
692	0	QUESTION "No, I’m not forgetting about it."
693	0	QUESTION "I’m asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down."
694	0	TRUMP Okay.
695	0	QUESTION So what do you base your facts on?
696	0	TRUMP "Okay, let me — come on, let’s go."
697	0	TRUMP Sort of — sort of —
698	0	QUESTION "And, secondly —"
699	0	TRUMP "No, no."
700	0	TRUMP You get one.
701	0	TRUMP You get one.
702	0	TRUMP Ready?
703	0	QUESTION "Well, the second question is —"
704	0	TRUMP Just sit down.
705	0	TRUMP Wait.
706	0	TRUMP Sit down.
707	0	TRUMP Sit down.
708	0	QUESTION Could you please answer it?
709	0	TRUMP Sit down.
710	0	TRUMP You get one question.
711	0	TRUMP "I get my numbers from a lot of sources — like Homeland Security, primarily."
712	0	TRUMP And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.
713	0	TRUMP And you know what else is a disaster?
714	0	TRUMP "The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month."
715	0	TRUMP Billions and billions of dollars.
716	0	TRUMP And it’s unnecessary.
717	0	QUESTION "So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?"
718	0	TRUMP "No, no."
719	0	TRUMP I use many stats.
720	0	TRUMP I use many stats.
721	0	QUESTION Could you share those stats with us?
722	0	TRUMP "Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use."
723	0	TRUMP "But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security."
724	0	TRUMP "All right, next question."
725	0	QUESTION And do you — wait a minute.
726	0	QUESTION Just a quick follow-up.
727	0	TRUMP Go ahead.
728	0	TRUMP No.
729	0	TRUMP Go.
730	0	TRUMP Please.
731	0	QUESTION "Thank you, Mr. President."
732	0	QUESTION I just want to bring you back to China for a second.
733	0	QUESTION The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.
734	0	QUESTION "The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide."
735	0	QUESTION "Are you eyeing a possible extension — 30 days, maybe 60 days?"
736	0	QUESTION What is the status there?
737	0	QUESTION Or is March 1st the deadline?
738	0	TRUMP Yeah.
739	0	TRUMP Very good question.
740	0	TRUMP So it’s a very big deal.
741	0	TRUMP "I guess you could say it’s like — must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think."
742	0	TRUMP "Trade with China, how big does that get?"
743	0	TRUMP "Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there."
744	0	TRUMP But it’s very complicated.
745	0	TRUMP "There are many, many points that we’re bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but they’re very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them."
746	0	TRUMP There is a possibility that I will extend the date.
747	0	TRUMP "And if I do that, if I see that we’re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that we’re charging now."
748	0	TRUMP I would not increase the tariffs.
749	0	QUESTION "Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because it’s gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office."
750	0	QUESTION Now it’s a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.
751	0	QUESTION What are your plans to reverse it?
752	0	TRUMP "Well, it’s all about growth."
753	0	TRUMP But before I —
754	0	QUESTION (Inaudible.)
755	0	TRUMP "— really focus on that — and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined."
756	0	TRUMP "So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined."
757	0	TRUMP Combine them all.
758	0	TRUMP So you can’t be talking about that.
759	0	TRUMP But I talk about it because I consider it very important.
760	0	TRUMP "But first, I have to straighten out the military."
761	0	TRUMP The military was depleted.
762	0	TRUMP "And if we don’t have a strong military — that hopefully we won’t have to use because it’s strong — if we don’t have a strong military, you don’t have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems."
763	0	TRUMP So I have to straighten out the military.
764	0	TRUMP That’s why I did the $700- and $716 billion.
765	0	TRUMP But growth will straighten it out.
766	1	TRUMP "You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down."
767	0	TRUMP "Everybody said, ""What happened?""  Well, what’s happening is growth."
768	0	TRUMP "But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military."
769	0	TRUMP And we have no choice but to straighten out our military.
770	0	QUESTION "Is growth the only answer, sir, or is (inaudible)?"
771	0	TRUMP "Yes, ma’am, go ahead."
772	0	QUESTION "Thank you, Mr. President."
773	0	QUESTION "On North Korea — back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement."
774	0	TRUMP Yes.
775	0	QUESTION "I was wondering what you thought has, you know, been accomplished since the last summit."
776	0	QUESTION And then —
777	0	TRUMP A lot.
778	0	QUESTION — are we going to be seeing anything concrete —
779	0	TRUMP A lot has been accomplished.
780	0	TRUMP Okay.
781	0	QUESTION — on denuclearization.
782	0	TRUMP Yeah.
783	0	TRUMP A lot has been accomplished.
784	0	TRUMP "We’re dealing with them, we’re talking to them."
785	0	TRUMP "When I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama."
786	0	TRUMP And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.
787	0	TRUMP It was supposed to be 15 minutes.
788	0	TRUMP "As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that."
789	0	TRUMP "And I said, ""What’s the biggest problem?"""
790	0	TRUMP "He said, ""By far, North Korea."""
791	0	TRUMP "And I don’t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea."
792	0	TRUMP I think he was ready to go to war.
793	0	TRUMP "In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea."
794	0	TRUMP And where are we now?
795	0	TRUMP No missiles.
796	0	TRUMP No rockets.
797	0	TRUMP No nuclear testing.
798	0	TRUMP We’ve learned a lot.
799	0	TRUMP "But much more importantly than all of it — much more important — much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship."
800	0	TRUMP I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.
801	0	TRUMP And I’ve done a job.
802	0	TRUMP "In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize."
803	0	TRUMP "He said, ""I have nominated you…"" or ""Respectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize."""
804	0	TRUMP "I said, ""Thank you."""
805	0	TRUMP Many other people feel that way too.
806	0	TRUMP "I’ll probably never get it, but that’s okay."
807	0	TRUMP They gave it to Obama.
808	0	TRUMP He didn’t even know what he got it for.
809	0	TRUMP He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.
810	0	TRUMP "He said, ""Oh, what did I get it for?"""
811	0	TRUMP "With me, I probably will never get it."
812	0	TRUMP "But if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people."
813	0	TRUMP Nobody talk about that.
814	0	TRUMP They don’t talk about that.
815	0	TRUMP "Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists."
816	0	TRUMP "And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, ""Please, please."""
817	0	TRUMP "And I thought — I said, ""No, it can’t happen. What are you talking about?"""
818	0	TRUMP "No, they’re going to get…"
819	0	TRUMP "And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into — to really — to really do big destruction."
820	0	TRUMP "And I put out a statement that ""you better not do it."""
821	0	TRUMP "And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack."
822	0	TRUMP "Or they’re doing it surgically, at least."
823	0	TRUMP Saved a lot of people.
824	0	TRUMP We do a lot of good work.
825	0	TRUMP "This administration does a tremendous job, and we don’t get credit for it."
826	0	TRUMP But I think the people understand what we do.
827	0	TRUMP "So Prime Minister Abe gave me — I mean, it’s the most beautiful five letter — five-page letter."
828	0	TRUMP Nobel Prize.
829	0	TRUMP He sent it to them.
830	0	TRUMP You know why?
831	0	TRUMP Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.
832	0	TRUMP And they had alarms going off; you know that.
833	0	TRUMP "Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe."
834	0	TRUMP I did that.
835	0	TRUMP And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.
836	0	TRUMP Fire and fury.
837	0	TRUMP Total annihilation.
838	0	TRUMP "My button is bigger than yours and ""my button works."""
839	0	TRUMP Remember that?
840	0	TRUMP You don’t remember that.
841	0	TRUMP "And people said, ""Trump is crazy."""
842	0	TRUMP And you know what it ended up being?
843	0	TRUMP A very good relationship.
844	0	TRUMP I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.
845	0	TRUMP Nobody else would have done that.
846	0	TRUMP The Obama administration couldn’t have done it.
847	0	TRUMP "Number one, they probably wouldn’t have done it."
848	0	TRUMP "And number two, they didn’t have the capability to do it."
849	0	TRUMP So I just want to thank everybody.
850	0	TRUMP "I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life."
851	0	SYSTEM (LAUGHTER)
852	0	TRUMP "Bill, good luck."
853	0	TRUMP A tremendous reputation.
854	0	TRUMP I know you’ll do a great job.
855	0	TRUMP Thank you very much.
856	0	TRUMP "And thank you, everybody."
857	0	TRUMP Thank you very much.
858	0	TRUMP Thank you.
