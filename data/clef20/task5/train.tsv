And welcome back.	0
There is history all around us here at downtown Milwaukee’s Riverside Theater, which opened in 1928.	0
It was nearly destroyed by fire in 1966.	0
It was lovingly restored in the 80s and has been at the heart of this city’s cultural life ever since.	0
It is a magnificent theater.	0
We’re here in the mid of a history-making Republican presidential campaign, bringing voters face to face with the candidates, showcasing their questions and bringing it all to you at home.	0
Joining us now is Ohio’s governor, John Kasich.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
How are you?	0
Good to see you.	0
Have a seat.	0
All right, we got a lot of questions from the audience about a lot of policy issues.	0
A couple of questions on news of the day.	0
Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, charged today with simple battery.	0
Would you fire him?	0
Well, I haven’t seen the video, but they tell me the video is real.	0
Of course I would.	0
Look, when you have problems like that, you have to act.	0
Now, I’ve been of course an executive running the seventh-largest state.	0
And we see things that happen.	0
At times, you want to give people the benefit of the doubt, but when you see things that are pretty clear – from what I understand the video is clear.	0
Of course would fire him.	0
Let’s talk about your path to the nomination.	0
You are pinning your hopes on a contested convention.	0
Assuming there is one, why would you be selected?	0
You’ve only won one state, your home state, Ohio.	0
Why would you get the nomination?	0
Well, a couple of reasons, Anderson.	0
First of all, in virtually every national poll, I am the only one that beats Hillary Clinton consistently.	1
In fact, in the last poll that came out I was up 11 points.	0
Secondly, and, you know, delegates would look, for example, at, you know, can you win in the fall?	0
I mean, it’s like a really important part of this thing, it’s not just the nomination, it’s about winning the election.	0
And frankly, if we do not have a strong candidate that brings people together, we have a prospect of losing the United States Senate as well.	0
And secondly, Anderson, at some point that people that go to a convention are going to be concerned about who actually could run the country.	0
I mean, it’s like a big deal.	0
You know, who could be president, who could be commander-in-chief?	0
And I have more experience than really all of them put together except for Mrs. Clinton.	0
I mean, I have — you know, I served 18 years on the defense — Armed Services Committee, I was in the Pentagon after 9/11.	0
I was chairman of the Budget Committee.	0
I was involved in welfare reform.	0
When I was chairman of the Budget Committee, we balanced the budget, we had job growth.	0
I’ve been the executive in Ohio.	0
We’ve grown jobs.	0
So at some point people are going to look at two things, who can win in the fall, and secondly who could be the best president?	0
But polls are one thing, though, I mean, to have only won — if it continues on this path, to have only won one state, your home state, won’t some delegates say, look, OK, the polls say he can win in a head-to-head matchup against Hillary Clinton, but the voters have spoken.	0
Well, Anderson, I think it’s pretty clear and most of the people in here I think would agree with this, for most of the debates, I was completely ignored.	0
I mean, it has been like the last three weeks to a month that people have started to pay attention to who I am and my message.	0
And it has fundamentally happened that way because I’ve not gotten down in the mud.	0
I haven’t name-called.	0
I haven’t had all these nasty sound bites.	0
I’ve just been laying out my record and my vision for what I want to see happen.	0
But conventions are very interesting.	0
Republicans have had 10 conventions.	0
And the leader going into the convention has only been the nominee three times out of 10.	0
Seven times out of 10 they were not.	0
So I think — and we’re going to do better as this calendar moves to the east.	0
Look, now I’m starting to get on my home court, you know, — look, I went to Ohio, I won by 11 points.	0
You know, I did very, well there.	0
We’re going to go to Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.	0
These are all places where I can do extremely well.	0
And we will continue to accumulate delegates.	0
And we’ll have momentum going into the convention.	0
And by the way, the convention is nothing more than an extension of the process we have going now.	0
Somehow people think they’re truncated somehow, they’re disjointed.	0
They’re not.	0
It’s a process of primaries.	0
You accumulate delegates.	0
You go to the convention.	0
And then they pick the nominees.	0
I want to ask you about terrorism.	0
When you were asked about what happened in Brussels last week — or let’s talk about that.	0
In terms of what U.S. response should and what the fight against ISIS should look like, you said yesterday that one of the opponents wants to make the sand glow and the other one complains about other countries not doing enough, obviously you were talking about Senator Cruz and Mr. Trump.	0
Why would America be safer under your watch?	0
Well, Anderson, first of all, I’ve been saying for a long time and laid out an extensive program on rebuilding the military.	0
Secondly, I’ve been the one arguing all along that we need to go after ISIS in a coalition like we had in the first Gulf War.	0
I was there when I saw it happen.	0
I saw our Muslim Arab friends join us in the West, and we pushed Saddam out of Kuwait.	0
You know, secondly, that same coalition needs come together and we need to destroy ISIS both in the air and on the ground, settle it down and then come home.	0
And let the regional powers draw the map.	0
There are a lot of countries, Saudi Arabia, that don’t necessarily see ISIS as their predominant threat.	0
Oh, no, no, no.	0
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states, they all know it’s an existential threat.	0
They know that they — that the kingdom hangs by a thread because of the radicalism of ISIS.	0
And so the fact is they will join us.	0
They joined us before against Saddam Hussein.	0
That was not as big of a deal as this is where they’re blowing people up all over the world.	0
Secondly, of course, I think, Anderson, that we need really good worldwide intelligence.	0
I think that the lemons we’re seeing can be turned into lemonade and I think a president of the United States can rally the civilized world to destroy these folks who are intent on destroying us.	0
And secondly, we talked about NATO.	0
That was another thing I talked about.	0
We need to change NATO from not just a military organization, but an intelligence-gathering and also a policing organization that works across boundaries.	0
All of us together, fighting together, working together, destroy ISIS, have the good human intelligence…	0
Donald Trump says NATO is obsolete.	0
Is it?	0
Well, of course it’s not.	0
That’s absurd, obsolete, OK?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Now, look, it’s really important that we get these countries to pitch in and do more.	0
They’ll never do as much as we want.	0
I mean, I lived through a whole time when we would push them, pressure them.	0
Part of the problem is it’s their governments over there.	0
You know, there is too much socialism, there is too much political correctness.	0
That’s why they didn’t even catch this thing in Brussels.	0
And you know that the screw-ups that we saw with the intelligence.	0
But here’s the thing: no, NATO has an additional role now.	0
And that is policing and intelligence gathering.	0
You see, we need to have the Muslims working with us and the West —	0
That’s critical?	0
Absolutely critical.	0
Let me tell you, Anderson, if we wanted to get information out of some radical that’s in a mosque — you’re a really great guy, but if you were three blocks from the mosque, do you think you’d get anything?	0
I don’t blend very well.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
No, you are don’t.	0
Well, the fact is is that we want the Muslims who are — they feel as strongly as we do about these murderers out there.	0
These Muslims, they’re the ones that have to police their own neighborhoods.	0
And, frankly, we need the imams to come out and issue statements about how their religion has been hijacked.	0
But it takes all of us together.	0
It takes us to have great human intelligence.	0
And here in the United States we’ve got counterterrorism task forces made up of the FBI, it’s made up of Homeland Security, state and local law enforcement, and their job is to disrupt.	0
That’s why the issue of Apple was so important because they need the resources to be able to carry out their job for all of us, but they need one other thing: they need the tools.	0
And if they can’t hear, then it becomes a problem.	0
But there’s also a role for us.	0
Because when we see something happening in our neighborhood, Anderson, we have an obligation to alert authorities as well.	0
You talked about Donald Trump belittle — in an interview today, you said about Donald Trump’s foreign, “I think that’s the most ridiculous of foreign policy I ever heard.	0
This is just somebody that just doesn’t understand foreign policy.	0
Just doesn’t” —	0
Well which part was I talking about?	0
I don’t remember.	0
I’m not sure either.	0
OK. Well, I mean, I think the idea that – I’ll tell you one.	0
Do you think he –	0
We’re going to have a religious test on who comes in the country.	0
So, when you come in the country, I say, well, are you a Muslim?	0
Raise your hand if you’re a Muslim.	0
I mean, come on, Anderson.	0
That’s not going to work.	0
We’re not going to police Muslim neighborhoods.	0
We can’t afford polarization of people who are in the civilized world.	0
You know, there are people all over the world that know that this threat has to be stopped.	0
It has to be destroyed, and we have to work together as a world.	0
Because when people in Pakistan die, we all die a little bit when they blow up innocent men, women and children at an Easter service.	0
I mean, the world understands this.	0
And this is an opportunity for us to be brought together.	0
The president, by the way, went to a baseball game in Cuba instead of coming home, meeting.	0
I’ll tell you what I would do if I were president.	0
I would come home, I would call world leaders.	0
I would gather my military and intelligence experts.	0
I would find out our vulnerabilities, and I would send them to Europe.	0
And I would say, let us look at what our problems are, and let’s fix them immediately.	0
The response of the White House is often to that criticism –	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The response of the White House to that criticism, and I want you to be able to respond to it, is often, well, look.	0
By changing the president’s schedule, it gives power to the terrorist group that they’re able to change the leader of the free world’ s schedule and that he can do the work he needs to do on wherever location he’s at.	0
So you kind of go to a baseball game, and you don’t come home?	0
Well, that’s another issue.	0
And – no, here’s the situation.	0
That attack was in the heart of Europe.	0
I mean, that was an attack on the very heart of our friends who live in Europe.	0
Yes, I think it’s important enough to come home.	0
Secondly  —	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
— I’ll give you another one that I can’t believe.	0
The president of the United States — the first thing he did is he wouldn’t meet with our friend Netanyahu.	0
OK, that was the first meeting he snubbed.	0
Now, he’s snubbed another one.	0
He’s snubbed a meeting with the president of Turkey.	0
Do you know how important it is for to us have good relations with Turkey?	0
They’re the gateway to the East.	0
Now, Erdogan is doing some things that none of us like.	0
But you know what?	0
We have to deal with him.	0
He is the one that alerted the Europeans about the radical that was moving over to Brussels.	0
You have to be able to manage this.	0
And I tell you, it’s complicated, it takes sophistication.	0
And you need to have good advisers.	0
But I’ll tell you what else you need.	0
You need experience, and you need a good gut.	0
And I’ve been involved in these things for almost all of my adult lifetime.	0
So, I have advisers, but I don’t have many teachers.	0
I understand most of these things.	0
We’ve talked about Trump’s campaign manager.	0
Your campaign manager tweeted this just a couple of hours ago.	0
Quote, “Cruz with zero friends, zero record, zero vision, zero chance decides to lie about @JohnKasich.	0
Desperate?	0
Trump right on one thing, “lying Ted.”	0
Does this signal any kind of a new phase –	0
No, I didn’t know he – you know, because sometimes he gets a little tweet happy, and I don’t like that, OK?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And I will have a word with him about it.	0
But let me say – that look.	0
The Cruz campaign, their super PAC is spending a half a billion (sic) to $800,000 against me in Wisconsin.	0
I mean, they say, well, Kasich doesn’t have any strength out here.	0
Usually, if you don’t have any strength, they don’t spend $500,000 to $800,000 attacking you.	0
And you know, the attacks are – look.	0
Arnold Schwarzenegger told me in 2010 when I was running for governor, I was saying, Arnold, they’re really beating me up.	0
He looked at me and said, “John, love the beatings.”  Okay, that’s part of politics, and I’ve learned to love the beatings.	0
But I mean, the fact is, is that they are hammering me, and they’re not hammering Trump.	0
It’s very interesting.	0
But that’s okay; I can take it.	0
In terms of tone and tenor of the campaign, your two fellow candidates have obviously been duking it out over the last week or so…	0
The last week or so?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
How about the last five months?	0
Where you been, Anderson?	0
In this new phase on the whole…	0
That’s why I’m not in the news.	0
I didn’t call anybody a name.	0
And you know what, I’m in the going to take the low road to the highest office in the land.	0
I’m not going to do it.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That’s my question.	0
That was my question, which was, what does it look like from the sidelines when you watch this?	0
I’ll tell you, sometimes it’s amazing to me.	0
Sometimes when I look at it I think, what the heck are we doing here?	0
You know, I was on a radio talk show with some guy here, Jay somebody or other, I don’t remember this morning — yes, whatever his name is.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Nice guy.	0
Nice guy.	0
And he was — and even yesterday I was on a different one, and a guy says to me, well, you know, maybe this is the new politics.	0
If name calling, bringing in spouses and ripping each other below the belt and wrestling in the mud is the new politics, we all need to stand against it.	0
Our children are watching.	0
This is America.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
We need to talk about what we’re for.	0
And I have been consistent.	0
Now, when they say something on policy-wise that’s bad, of course I’m going to say something about it, but I don’t want to go down into — I’m not going to go down there.	0
I hope not.	0
I could screw up but I hope not.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Let’s go to our audience for some issues (ph).	0
Jim Vogel (ph) is here.	0
He works in advertising.	0
He says he’s leaning right now towards Senator Cruz.	0
Jim, welcome.	0
Hi, governor.	0
In Ohio you accepted Medicaid expansion and you took on the — I’m sorry, the health care exchanges and it was to help the poor.	0
Here in Wisconsin we used — Governor Walker used BadgerCare to essentially provide the same services at the same levels, and yet we did it without creating a whole new entitlement program and expanding federal debt.	0
Why did you choose Obamacare?	0
Why did you choose the Washington-based solution?	0
And why can’t you guys ever look at some other source other than Washington for these solutions?	0
Okay, let me say a couple of things.	0
First of all, it’s not so simple what Governor Walker did here.	0
If you look at it, it’s more complicated.	0
And by the way, today the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel endorsed me for president of the United States saying I’m the guy that is a pragmatic conservative that can get things done.	0
I was really appreciative of that endorsement.	0
But look, I took a Medicaid program that was growing at 10 1/2 percent, and in my second year as governor it grew at 2 1/2 percent, without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one benefit.	0
How did I do it?	0
I brought innovation to the system.	0
Now I then had a choice.	0
Now that my program was under control, I then had a choice.	0
Could I bring money back, which is frankly our money, Ohio money, back to Ohio to solve some of our problems.	0
Let me tell what you we’ve done.	0
I don’t believe the mentally ill ought to be sleeping under a bridge or living in prison.	0
It costs $22,500 a year to put them in prison.	0
If I can get their medication and get them on their feet and if get they can get a job, they become taxpayers.	0
We save money.	0
Secondly, I believe that the drug addicted in our prisons should be treated, because we don’t want a revolving door of in and out of the prisons, because that costs $22,500 a year, and we also are throwing a life down the drain.	0
So guess what, because of our program now in the prisons and with the community, we have an 80 percent success rate in not having people go back in, and our recidivism rate is 27 percent.	0
And, by the way, we’re running a $2 billion surplus.	1
We don’t put our budget together with scotch tap and bail and wire — we’re running a $2 million surplus.	0
We’re managing it all.	0
So where are we?	0
Where we are in Ohio, is we are not treating the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, they’re in a better position, they’re not in our prisons, and at the same time, they’re getting on their feet, they’re becoming taxpayers and our Medicaid program is completely under control.	0
And by the way, I reject Obamacare, and I did not go along with the exchange that they were trying to force on me, because I never knew what the heck was going to come of it.	0
I actually have a solid health care plan to replace Obamacare, which involves transparency, competition, market-oriented forces.	0
We’re actually doing it in my state, and I’d like to spread it all across the country.	0
So the idea of doing that was not only compassionate, but it also made good economic sense for our state and it’s working out quite well.	0
Thank you for your question.	0
Governor, I want you too meet, this is Julie Grace.	0
She’s a student at Marquette University…	0
You know what, just one other thing I wanted to say.	0
You understand that I spent 10 years of my life fighting to balance the budget.	0
And we got it balanced.	0
Senator Domenici and I worked with the Clinton administration.	0
We got the budget balanced four years in a row.	0
It hadn’t been balanced since man walked on the moon, hasn’t been balanced since.	0
And when I left Washington, there was a $5 trillion surplus, and guess who spent it?	0
The Republicans.	0
Now, sir, you have to stand in the breach when you’re a leader.	0
And what I did in Washington in getting that budget under control, and seeing it liftoff in jobs, and what I’ve done in Ohio, we’re now up 417,000 jobs in Ohio from a downturn of when I came in of 350,000.	0
And we’ve cut taxes by more than any governor in the country, including your governor.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
All right.	0
I want you to meet Julie Grace, she’s a student at Marquette University.	0
But thank you.	0
And she said she’s supporting you.	0
Oh, you are?	0
I am.	0
Good.	0
OK.  Say something really, really good.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I’ll try.	0
So in Europe many far right conservative parties, anti-immigrant parties have been gaining momentum recently, specifically Germany, Sweden, France, and Britain.	0
Do you think a similar movement is occurring here in the U.S.?	0
And if so, how can the Republican Party address this?	0
We’ve gone through periods of time in our history when we have turned against immigration.	0
It has happened.	0
And these movement have sprung up.	0
Look, we have to — young lady, we have to protect the border.	0
That is a given, OK?	0
For a couple of reasons, and one of them is security.	0
So we have to get the border done.	0
And secondly, we should have a guest worker program where people can come in and work, and then they can go back home, because that’s what they want to do.	0
And thirdly, if they came here illegally but they’ve not committed a crime since they’ve been here, they’ll pay a fine, back taxes, and they can have a path to legalization, not a path to citizenship.	0
Now the idea that we’re going to drive around in Waukesha and we’re going to drive around here in Milwaukee, and we’re going to yank people out of their homes, leaving their kids on the front porch crying and screaming?	0
Come on, that’s ridiculous, OK?	0
Call it what it is, it’s ridiculous.	0
But we can get the border fixed.	0
We can have a guest worker program.	0
We can get a path to legalization, not let anybody else come.	0
You have got to go back, no excuses.	0
And you want to know what I think?	0
I think that can pass.	0
I think that can pass the United States Congress.	0
And I think it can pass with the American people and get this issue behind us and get this thing healed.	0
We need a healing in America.	0
And stop kicking cans down the road and solve problems in this country.	0
And I think that’s a reasonable solution to this problem of immigration.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you for your question.	0
This is Asa White, he’s a student also, says he’s leaning towards supporting Donald Trump right now.	0
Asa, welcome.	0
Thank you.	0
My question — the most recent terrorist attack in Brussels has highlighted a big issue we have with our attack on foreign terrorism.	0
That is, we now have neighborhoods that are being deemed as terrorist hotbeds.	0
Do you support Senator Cruz’s — when he says we should go into Muslim neighborhoods and patrol them?	0
No, I don’t support that at all.	0
I think it’s ridiculous.	0
And you know what?	0
The guy who was the best police guy in the whole country, he understands policing, is a guy named Bill Bratton.	0
He’s now currently the police chief in New York.	0
He was the police chief under Rudy Giuliani.	0
He was the head of the metro system in Boston.	0
And he ran the Los Angeles Police Department.	0
He is absolutely the best.	0
He said that plan is ridiculous.	0
And let me just tell you, sir, we all want to catch these bad guys.	0
And I know how it works because I’ve got Joint Terrorism Task Force members who are in my state, they’re in your state.	0
We need to hear what’s happening in the community.	0
So let me just — let me ask you this question.	0
If all of a sudden we start trying to pinpoint you — we have a religious test, we’re going to now patrol your neighborhood and your home because we suspect,  even though you’re as law-abiding as anybody else in the country.	0
Now I want you to help me find out who the bad guys are.	0
I mean, come on, that doesn’t make any sense that if we polarize the entire Muslim community, how are we going to get the information we want?	0
We want Muslims who go to mosques who see radicalization to tell the authorities about it.	0
Because I have got to tell you, the vast, vast, vast majority of Muslims, they think their religion has been hijacked, that we have murderers out there who have distorted their religion.	0
And they want to stop had as much as we want to stop it.	0
So the fact is let’s isolate those people who are the killers and let’s work together as a community of civilized people to take the battle to them.	0
Destroy ISIS, that’s a given, and then after that great intelligence to make sure we can thwart these attacks and get the Europeans to start, you know, paying attention and doing their job.	0
I mean, that’s what I think we need to do, sir.	0
So thank you.	0
Thank you for your question.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
This is Jim Walker.	0
He’s a Republican from Franklin, Wisconsin.	0
He said he’s leaning towards Ted Cruz for his experience, but likes you because you run a blue-collar state.	0
Jim, welcome.	0
Thank you very much, Anderson.	0
And welcome to the great state of Wisconsin, governor.	0
I represent a manufacturer, farm equipment manufacturer, here in Wisconsin that directly employs many thousands of people.	0
Indirectly, as you can imagine, with farm equipment that we sell, we indirectly support many more thousand farmers who buy our equipment.	0
On top of that we export about a third of our product that we manufacture here in essence.	0
So in essence, we’re a global manufacturing company.	0
To spark a war right now would not only be detrimental to business, but all of those people directly and indirectly that I said we support.	0
My question to you is, as president, how would you engage in diplomacy that won’t hurt global manufacturing businesses?	0
Yes, number one, I want you to know, sir, that in my state now, we have over 63,000 new manufacturing jobs.	0
It’s really cool that — and we’re paying attention to all the sectors, which we need to do as a nation.	0
Let’s talk about trade for a second.	0
It’s a tough issue.	0
One out of five Americans work for something related to trade, and secondly, that’s 38 million Americans.	0
Now we need to have open and free trade.	0
You know, I was saying — I do these townhalls all the time.	0
I love them, by the way.	0
Look, remember when we got all of those Japanese cars coming into our country?	0
You know what happened to U.S. cars?	0
They got better.	0
Innovation and competition really works, okay.	0
But at the same time when we do trade agreements and other countries cheat, and they do cheat — some of them manipulate their currency, and we need to call them on it when they do it.	0
When we find it, we need to call them on it.	0
But let me tell you another issue for you.	0
So we had U.S. steel invest a lot of money in state.	0
They invest money all over the country.	0
The Koreans were dumping tubes inside the U.S.  That means selling product below the cost of what it took them to make  them.	0
By the time you research them and prove your case, which you would have to do, it could be a year or two and all your people are out of work.	0
We need an early-warning system.	0
And let me tell you, when they cheat, I will act as the president of the United States.	0
Think of it this way.	0
If Ohio State came up to play your beloved Badgers and I asked for five downs to get a first down and you only got four, how would you feel?	0
You wouldn’t put up with it, okay?	0
We should not put up with countries when they cheat.	0
But that does not keep us from embracing the notion of open and free trade.	0
One other thing, we now have this trade agreement on the table, you the TPP agreement.	0
You know, what we basically do when we trade is we’re the most open country, and everybody else has barriers.	0
So what we try to  do is to get their barriers down so we  get our products into their country.	0
But there’s another element of this.	0
You worry about the Chinese and their growing strength, particularly in Asia?	0
Make a trade agreement, integrate ourselves with our friends in Asia who can become a bulwark against the strength of the Chinese.	0
But governor…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
(inaudible) open trade good when they cheat.	0
You’ve got to have an early-warning system.	0
You’ve got to shut it off.	0
And by the way, agriculture depends on exports more than about any other industry in this country.	0
But, governor, that message isn’t resonate — I mean, Donald Trump is saying trade deals are essentially bad.	0
They’re exporting jobs overseas.	0
That’s the message which seems to be resonating with voters.	0
Anderson, I can say all kinds of things to get people stirred up, but leaders don’t do that.	0
Leaders tell people the way that they see it, even if it means for a while you’re unpopular.	0
Look, when I — after my first — you can’t believe how many people I made angry in Washington by fighting to balance the budget.	0
Now in Ohio, in my first year in office, I was one of the most unpopular governors, but I knew what the formula was, and now I’m one of the most popular governors.	0
You cannot make decisions as a leader by putting your finger in the air and — or doing focus groups or telling people what they want to hear so you get them involved, but you know what they’re saying — what you’re saying is not true.	0
I will not do that.	0
I have never done it in my lifetime, and I’m not about to start.	0
Period and end of story.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
This is William Dunford.	0
He’s a student at Marquette University.	0
He says he supports Ted Cruz — William.	0
Thank you, governor.	0
My question is, 70 years after World War II and a quarter century after the Cold War ended, a lot of European security remained a responsibility for Americans?	0
And given that Europeans are wealthy enough to defend themselves, why shouldn’t they?	0
Well, young man, look, I don’t know if you’re a leader in your family or not.	0
But leaders, you know, there are people in here who do more for their family than their brothers and sisters, their siblings.	0
OK?	0
And sometime, your spouse says why do we have do this all the time?	0
Because that’s what leaders do.	0
I mean, frankly, of course, the Europeans can do more to support themselves.	0
Their economies, by and large, have been a shambles.	0
So, they need to straighten out their economies.	0
And it’s a really tough struggle.	0
I mean, I can tell you that it’s hard for them to get right with things.	0
So, they are weak economically.	0
That doesn’t excuse them from not carrying their share of the load.	0
But at the same time, we don’t want to have those relationships deteriorate or be eliminated.	0
You know why?	0
Because it hurts us, too.	0
We need to have a strong Western Europe.	0
And by the way, I heard – I just heard briefly somebody was saying that we should just ignore Ukraine.	0
Are you kidding me?	0
The United States of America should be arming the Ukrainians who want to fight for freedom against Putin.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We should be arming them with non-lethal – with lethal defensive aid.	0
Now, young man, we should always tell them you’ve got to do more.	0
And we should use whatever leverage we have to get them to do more.	0
But I’m going to tell you as Americans, as long as I’ve been alive, we always carry more of the share of the burden than we would like.	0
We always do.	0
And you know there’s an old Scripture that says “To whom much is given, much is expected.”  And as president, I would fight to get them to give us more, and I would use whatever leverage I could to get them to give us more.	0
But to be honest with you, we’re always going to complain about this.	0
But to walk away from that alliance, are you kidding me?	0
If we walk away and it gets weaker, how long do you think it will take the Islamists to come over here?	0
We need to work with them to destroy ISIS in the Middle East, and then we’ve got to work together as a society.	0
That’s the way it works.	0
So, there’s no easy way out of this.	0
And you know, when you are a leader who has seen these things, then you get a sobering approach.	0
That’s why the “Journal Centennial” here in Milwaukee said Kasich is a pragmatic conservative.	0
Because you just can’t knock all the pieces off the chess board when you get frustrated.	0
It’s a good question, there.	0
Governor, thank you.	0
We’re going to take a quick break.	0
We’re going to have more questions for Governor Kasich as this 360 CNN town hall continues.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Welcome back.	0
We continue the conversation, taking more voter questions for Ohio governor John Kasich.	0
Thanks very much for joining us again.	0
I want to ask you a question which I asked to each of the other candidates as well, and had some surprising answers.	0
A pledge was made early on in this race by all the GOP candidates, saying that they would pledge to support whoever the nominee was.	0
Tonight Donald Trump said that pledge, essentially, was null and void.	0
He would not pledge to continue to support whoever the nominee is, he would have to wait and see.	0
And, Ted Cruz wouldn’t really answer it, but implied that a lot has changed, and that not that Donald Trump has…	0
… Maybe I won’t answer it either.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Anderson, here’s the thing, this is what you have to weigh, and I wish everybody could get out and experience this.	0
When you’re in the arena, OK?	0
You develop respect for people that are in the arena, but you know?	0
I’ve been disturbed by some of the things that I’ve seen, and I have to think about what my word and endorsement would mean in a presidential campaign.	0
So, I want to see how this thing finishes out, and you know what?	0
I want to tell you, I think the little engine that can keeps going.	0
I sure hope they’ll endorse me for president when I’m the nominee coming out of the convention in Cleveland, how’s that?	0
Is that a good answer?	0
I don’t know.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(LAUGHING)	0
I would be remiss not to follow up, essentially you’re saying it’s in the balance.	0
You’re kind of waiting to see?	0
Well, I would say that that would be a good way to describe it.	0
So, you’re not ironclad, standing by the initial pledge to support whoever the nominee is?	0
You know, frankly, all of us shouldn’t have even answered that question, but it was the first debate, and — you know?	0
What the heck, sometimes you answer questions — you ought to just say I’m not answering it.	0
So, now, just to be clear…	0
… I’m as clear as you’re going to get out of me.	0
You’re not standing by that pledge…	0
No, I don’t want to be political here.	0
I got to see what happens.	0
If the nominee is somebody that I think is really hurting the  country, and dividing the country, I can’t stand behind them, but we have a ways to go.	0
Let’s see how this all folds out, and then I’ll let you know…	0
… Is it fair to say that you believe Donald Trump looks like he would harm the country if he was the nominee?	0
That’ll be up to the voters here.	0
I’m not going to get into that.	0
That’s too much below the belt.	0
I want to introduce you to Time Carey, he’s a small business owner.	0
He says she’s still undecided.	0
Tim, welcome.	0
Hello, Governor, welcome to Wisconsin.	0
My family and I raced sled dogs in Northern Wisconsin, and this last year we started a business manufacturing sled dog equipment, a partner of mine and myself.	0
I funded the whole thing myself so far up to this point, and I just — I was wondering what your policies on small business to help people get small businesses going, or tax incentives, or what your thoughts were on that.	0
I hate to keep talking about my state, but it’s a good illustration of my philosophy if I become president.	0
Our small businesses pay virtually no income tax in Ohio because we want small businesses to grow, and for the young people that are here, the best chance you have of getting a job once you graduate from college is with a small business.	0
So, I’m for lowering the income taxes nationally.	0
I’d like to have a 28, a 25 and a 10 percent rate because you probably pay through on your personal taxes, you have a pass-through corporation.	0
So, we need to bring the taxes down and help small businesses.	0
The other thing we have to be careful of is we’re not snuffing out the small lending institutions, the community banks.	0
I was – where was I?	0
I was in La Crosse, and I went to this little bakery.	0
And this woman proudly was talking about how she built this bakery business.	0
It was a fantastic place.	0
And she said a got a $9,000 loan.	0
I said, how did you get it?	0
She said, well, I went to one local community bank and said if you have won’t loan me the money, I’m going to go to the one down the street.	0
What we’re facing now in America because of the overregulation on some of the big banks that’s trickled down to the smaller banks is we’re beginning to see the smaller banks go out of business.	0
Those are the ones you depend upon to get the loan you need because they know you, right?	0
So I think first of all, lower taxes – of course, for you.	0
Commonsense regulation so we’re not crushing you with another stupid for that somebody in the government decides you have to abide by.	0
And a path to fiscal stability, a balanced budget.	0
Those are the things that will help you more than anything else.	0
And one final thing: workforce development.	0
We have got to begin to teach our kids in K through 12 and also in the community college and the four-year schools to be getting an education for a job that exists.	0
Don’t get educated in a vacuum.	0
Make sure you know what you want to do, and look for an education that can lead you to a real job.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Good luck.	0
Good luck.	0
Let me follow up on that.	0
Sorry —	0
I did a sled dog trip one time in New Hampshire many years ago, and I thought I was going to drown in the water.	0
When I come up, you can give me a safe ride.	0
How’s that?	0
All right.	0
Yeah, any time.	0
Thank you.	0
I want to follow up on that, because you often – and you’ve done it tonight – touting Ohio’s economic record.	0
According to FactCheck.org, Ohio has actually lagged behind the nation in job growth during your tenure as governor.	0
So why — if that’s true, because they say –	0
Well, that’s not true.	0
Well, they say private sector job in Ohio was 9.3 percent during your tenure.	0
The national private sector job growth rate was 11.7 percent —	0
Anderson, we were 48th when I became governor, now we’re in the top 10.	0
We went from at 350,000 job loss to a 417,000 job gain.	0
We’re doing very, very well.	0
But we’re not out of the woods yet.	0
But — let’s go back to Washington.	0
When I fought for all those years to balance the budget, cut the capital gains tax — that’s the tax  that gentleman uses when is he takes a risk — jobs were flying out like you couldn’t believe.	0
And there was no discussion of income inequality.	0
There are three things needed to grow an economy: common sense regulations; we don’t have them now.	0
Lower taxes; all the taxes are going up.	0
And a balanced – and a movement toward a balanced budget.	0
And we’re blowing all the budget up.	0
So you go to the doctor, say, how do I get healthy?	0
They say, well, you do these three things.	0
You go back, say, I’m not feeling well.	0
And he or she says, well, what did you do?	0
Well, I didn’t listen to anything you said.	0
‘	0
So, this is a formula that will work to bring our country back.	0
Folks, I only say it because I’m only doing this because I want to you have job security.	0
And I want to you believe that your kids are going to have a better life than you got from your parents.	0
That’s the great American legacy and that’s when I’m committed to, folks.	0
No matter who I tick off in the process.	0
That’s what we got to do, okay?	0
So —	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
This is Mary Beth Gahn.	0
She’s a sales representative for her family’s 106-year-old small business.	0
She said she’s undecided.	0
Welcome.	0
Good evening, Governor.	0
Yes.	0
As a practices Roman Catholic, I believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death.	0
If you were our president, would you support legislation or a nominee to the Supreme Court which would would create a protected class for unborn persons the same way we have protected classes for minority races and sexual orientations?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I’ve been pro-life all of my career.	0
The only exceptions are rape, incest and life of the mother.	0
Now, when it comes to a Supreme Court justice, we’ve got to be careful about litmus tests because we don’t know where they begin and where they end.	0
But I want to appoint judges who are conservative, who don’t make law but interpret the law.	0
And when it comes to my pro-life record, I mean, it speaks for itself.	0
The other thing I would tell you, though, you said life begins and then it ends at death.	0
I’m going to give you another thought.	0
Life begins, then it ends at death and then we have another life yet to come.	0
Don’t lose sight of that.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
OK?	0
Thank you.	0
That’s what Easter was all about, right?	0
Okay.	0
Our next guest is Joseph Rice.	0
He is a small business – or he is a business owner from White Fish Bay.	0
He says he is slightly leaning towards Ted Cruz but that his heart is with you, governor.	0
Joseph?	0
Well, then go with the heart, man!	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Well, I’ll try to ask a heart-felt question here, Governor.	0
I’m curious to know how you may have shown moral courage in the face of public opposition.	0
So can you cite an action that you took or decision that you made knowing it was the right thing to do, despite it being politically unpopular?	0
Well, I — look, I don’t want to get into how courageous I am or anything, but look, we — the gentleman stood up, first question out of here was Medicaid expansion.	0
I knew it wasn’t going to be all that popular.	0
Of course I wasn’t thinking about running for president.	0
I’ll tell you the story.	0
I had this woman, she’s terrific.	0
She runs our mental health, drug addiction services.	0
She comes into my office and says — I said to her, do you think I’m going to expand Medicaid?	0
And she says, well, I pray every night you will.	0
And I said, well, okay, your prayers are answered; I’m going do it.	0
She walked out of my office into the ante (ph) room and broke down and cried of joy for the fact that she can now help more people.	0
You know, the fact is, is that you can’t sit around worrying about who is really going to like you.	0
I’ll give you another one.	0
When I was in Washington, I said if we’re going to reform welfare for the poor people, we ought to reform it for the rich people.	0
So I fought for corporate welfare reform.	0
And we closed some of the loopholes that these big companies got when they moved — you know, when they moved out of the country to get — or moved to Puerto Rico, for example, to get tax advantages.	0
I thought it was the right thing to do.	0
You wouldn’t believe how hard it was to get the federal budget balanced.	0
One time we had a conference, I wanted to present the opposition to the Clinton tax increase, and I had a specific program to fight that, and we had a Republican conference, and Newt was sitting in the back of the room, and we had 36 speakers, and 34 said, Kasich shouldn’t unveil this plan.	0
I walked to the back of the room.	0
I said, Newt, how are we doing?	0
He said, better than I thought we’d be.	0
The plan got out.	0
And if you ever heard Joe Scarborough talk, the battle that we engaged in, in ’93 and ’94 against the Clinton tax increases inspired him to run for Congress, and brought a whole new wave of people into the Congress.	0
Sir, what you have to realize in this business is you’re there for a short period of time.	0
You have to drive the car when you get your hands on the wheel, and you got to have people around that will tell you when you’re on the wrong path, because sometimes you get on the wrong path.	0
But I have to also tell you, you don’t ever want to look back and say, I played politics, I took care of my party and I didn’t serve the people.	0
So I’ve been in politics a long time.	0
I’m as a big of a reformer and an idealist as I was the day I got elected, because I believe we can  change the world and make the world better for everyone.	0
And sometimes you get people upset.	0
That’s kind of goes with the territory.	0
You know what Harry Truman said, if you want a friend and you’re in Washington, you better go get a dog.	0
Okay?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
This is Charlotte Rasmussen.	0
Charlote Rasmussen.	0
She’s from the township of Butler.	0
She’s retired.	0
She says she’s undecided.	0
Welcome, Charlotte.	0
Hello.	0
Governor Kasich, if you become the nominee of the party, who are you going to pick for your vice president?	0
Are you available?	0
You look great tonight.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
No, you know what, that’s so far ahead.	0
That’s like measuring the drapes.	0
But I picked a lieutenant governor, somebody to run with me, a great woman, she was our auditor, and I picked her to run with me because she understood what I wanted to accomplish, and she was willing to be a really great teammate.	0
She’s done great job.	0
So you want to pick somebody who you’re comfortable with and somebody who understands what you’re all about, and somebody who’s not afraid to speak up to you.	0
You see, you can’t just surround yourself with sycophants.	0
You’ve got to have people there that can tell you, no, I don’t think that’s right, and then you argue it out.	0
And at the end, though, at the end, once you decide, the whole team moves in the same direction.	0
I have been able to be able to accomplish things in politics, I’m going to tell you, not because I’m so great, but I’ve been able to attract people throughout the years — I have some people that have been around me for 30 years.	0
And we form a great team, and we keep our eyes on the horizon.	0
And you know what I believe, I think everybody wants to be involved with something that’s bigger than themselves.	0
And that’s what I always try to represent and present in public life.	0
So it’d be somebody along those lines.	0
Okay?	0
Aaron Rodgers maybe if he had a better year next year.	0
We’ll see.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We’re going take a quick break.	0
We’re going to have more with Governor Kasich as our CNN Republican townhall continues from Milwaukee.	0
We’ll be right back.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Welcome back.	0
We’re here with Governor John Kasich of Ohio.	0
We’re here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.	0
Yesterday CNN reported that your campaign is looking to work or coordinate behind the scenes with the Cruz campaign in an effort to try to deny Donald Trump delegates to get to the nomination.	0
Is that something — I mean, have approached Ted Cruz directly about that yourself?	0
No, no, I’m not involved in the process stuff.	0
I mean, campaigns always talk.	0
I mean, there is always ways they do it.	0
But I’m not in the middle of that.	0
And I haven’t seen Ted since the last debate.	0
So I’m not involved in that.	0
We were talking during the break about how many townhalls.	0
You said you’ve probably done over 200 or so.	0
Yes.	0
Just like this.	0
And I remember, I spoke with you at a townhall that we did in South Carolina.	0
And one of the things you said to that has always stuck in my mind, I kind of wanted to follow up with you about.	0
You said that this campaign has caused you to slow down.	0
And I wondered — it was in reference to an incident you had with a young man at a town hall.	0
I’ve had many incidents.	0
In what way has it caused you to slow down?	0
Well, because there’s a lot of lonely people out there.	0
They come to my meetings and they say things — I haven’t seen it in Wisconsin, but I have seen it all over the country.	0
And the young man that gave me a hug was just emblematic of what I’ve seen all over.	0
I think when people want to feel safe and for some reason they come to the townhalls I have, which are basically townhalls about how we can fix things and how we can be hopeful, and for some reason people feel safe.	0
And I — that’s the grace of the lord as far as I’m concerned, to let people feel that way.	0
And, I would also say — and this is important.	0
I want to ship a lot of programs back to the states, but here’s what I really want everybody to know I believe.	0
The spirit of our country, Anderson, doesn’t rest in the president.	0
I mean, the president’s important, but the spirit of our country rests in the neighborhoods, it rests in the people who are here tonight.	0
We’re the ones that need to change the world, we’re the ones that need to fix education, deal with the problems of the poor.	0
You know, one of the things I’ve said, you take a lady who was married 50 years, her husband died, nobody calls her anymore.	0
Call her on a Monday, what does she do on a Thursday?	0
She’s gets her hair done, then when Saturday comes, when you’re going to take her to dinner somehow not one hair is out of place.	0
When you pick her up she wears a dress she hadn’t worn in six months.	0
Are you changing the world?	0
I think you are.	0
When a nurse spends an extra 15 minutes with a family that’s in trouble and says things are going to be OK, Anderson, I just happen to believe — I don’t want to get too carried away here.	0
But, you know?	0
The Lord’s given us all a certain purpose in life, and we need to carry it out.	0
We need to live a life bigger than ourselves.	0
Now, I’m not applying for sainthood, and neither is anybody else, but we can get up every day and try to live a life to help heal this world.	0
We need the solutions in Washington to create the jobs.	0
That is an absolute — without jobs we don’t have anything.	0
But, when we shift welfare, education, infrastructure, job training, Medicaid programs back to the states then we’ve got to run them, and we have to run them where we live.	0
And, frankly, state government ought to be shifting more power to the neighborhoods.	0
That’s the spirit of our country.	0
The spirit of our country — don’t you think where we live?	0
It’s in you.	0
It’s in you.	0
It’s in me, and him.	0
It’s not in somebody, you know, down in Washington D.C.	0
You think?	0
I mean, I hope so.	0
I believe that.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I want to thank you for taking part.	0
That’s it?	0
Yeah.	0
I want to thank you for this town hall, we’d love to do another one.	0
That is all the time we have.	0
I want to thank all the candidates, thank the voters who had such good questions.	0
Everyone in this room who made tonight possible, including the Riverside Theater and Turner Hall here in Milwaukee.	0
Thank You.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States...	0
[Applause]	0
...and citizens of America, tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done. Recent threats...	0
[Applause]	0
Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.	0
Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.	0
That torch is now in our hands.	0
And we will use it to light up the world.	0
I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter...	0
[Applause]	0
...of American greatness is now beginning.	0
A new national pride is sweeping across our nation.	0
And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.	0
What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit.	0
Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.	0
[Applause]	0
All the nations of the world — friend or foe — will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.	0
In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250 years since the day we declared our independence.	0
It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.	0
But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year?	0
What kind of country will we leave for our children?	0
I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.	0
For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.	0
We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit and so many other places throughout our land.	0
We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross	0
[Fact check: Open in parts, but heavily patrolled as well. ]	0
, and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.	0
And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.	0
Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.	0
The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds, families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.	0
But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus, as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.	0
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first, because only then can we truly make America great again.	0
[Applause]	0
Dying industries will come roaring back to life.	0
Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.	0
Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.	0
Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways, gleaming across our very, very beautiful land.	0
Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop.	0
And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity.	0
Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you.	0
It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.	0
Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.	0
[Applause]	0
The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on Nov. 8, a record.	0
We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic — and it is a fantastic — new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.	1
We have placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials — and a lifetime ban...	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency...	0
[Applause]	0
... and we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.	0
[Applause]	0
We're going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners.	0
[Fact check: This is partly true but misleading.]	0
[Applause]	0
We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines...	0
[Applause]	0
... thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs.	0
[Fact check: This needs context.]	0
And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.	0
[Applause]	0
We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
[Applause]	0
And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.	0
[Applause]	0
To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime.	0
I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation.	0
[Fact check: True, but they don't do much.]	0
[Applause]	0
We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.	0
[Applause]	0
At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.	0
[Applause]	0
By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages	1
[Fact check: Maybe a little. ]	1
, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.	1
[Applause]	1
We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.	1
We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders.	0
[Applause]	0
For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border.	0
[Applause]	0
As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens.	1
[Fact check: Not a big change.]	1
Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.	1
To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?	0
[Applause]	0
Our obligation is to serve, protect and defend the citizens of the United States.	0
We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.	0
[Applause]	0
According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.	0
We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes, even the World Trade Center.	0
We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.	0
It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.	0
[Applause]	0
Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.	0
We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America, and we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.	0
[Applause]	0
That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe, and to keep those out who will do us harm.	0
[Applause]	0
As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and all beliefs.	0
We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.	0
[Applause]	0
I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the state of Israel.	0
[Applause]	0
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution.	0
[Applause]	0
I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you, Maureen.	0
Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.	0
To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law.	0
He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.	0
[Applause]	0
Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.	0
Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.	0
[Fact check: This is misleading.]	0
Over 43 million people are now living in poverty.	0
[Fact check: True — but the number has also fallen.]	0
And over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.	0
[Fact check: The number is correct.]	0
More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working.	0
We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.	0
In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined.	0
We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since Nafta was approved	0
[Fact check: Not because of Nafta. ]	0
, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.	0
Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion.	0
And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.	0
Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party.	0
It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.	0
But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy, making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much, much harder for companies to leave our country.	0
[Applause]	0
Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.	1
My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.	0
[Applause]	0
It will be a big, big cut.	0
At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.	0
We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers — have to do it.	0
[Applause]	0
Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.	0
I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.	0
In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.	0
[Applause]	0
"And they wanted me to ride one, and I said, ""No, thank you."""	0
[Laughter]	0
"At our meeting, I asked them, ""How are you doing?"	0
"How is business?"""	0
They said that it's good.	0
"I asked them further, ""How are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales?"""	0
They told me — without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it — that it's very hard to do business with other countries, because they tax our goods at such a high rate.	0
They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.	0
They weren't even asking for a change.	0
But I am. I believe...	0
[Applause]	0
I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade.	0
It's been a long time since we had fair trade.	0
"The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned that ""the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."""	0
Lincoln was right, and it's time we heeded his advice and his words.	0
[Applause]	0
I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken — advantage of us any longer.	0
They have taken advantage of our country no longer.	0
[Applause]	0
I am going to bring back millions of jobs.	0
Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.	0
[Applause]	0
The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.	0
Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system.	0
[Applause]	0
It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.	0
Yet in America we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.	0
According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.	0
[Fact check: This needs context.]	0
Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits.	0
It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class.	0
And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed.	0
[Applause]	0
I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our laws.	0
If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.	0
[Applause]	0
Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program: the building of the interstate highway system.	0
The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.	0
[Applause]	0
America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.	1
With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times, if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.	0
[Applause]	0
To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States, financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.	0
[Applause]	0
This effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American and hire American.	0
[Applause]	0
Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare...	0
[Applause]	0
... with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care.	0
[Applause]	0
Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country.	0
[Applause]	0
The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going to do.	0
[Applause]	0
Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.	1
[Fact check: True, but cherry-picked.]	1
As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.	0
Gov.	0
Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and it's unsustainable and collapsing.	1
One third of the counties have only one insurer, and they're losing them fast, they are losing them so fast.	0
They're leaving.	0
And many Americans have no choice at all.	0
There's no choice left.	0
Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan?	0
We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.	0
Obamacare is collapsing	1
[Fact check: This is an exaggeration. ]	1
, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.	1
[Applause]	1
Action is not a choice; it is a necessity.	0
So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.	0
[Applause]	0
Here are the principles that should guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans.	0
First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.	0
[Applause]	0
Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.	0
[Applause]	0
Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.	0
[Applause]	0
Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.	0
[Applause]	0
And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines...	0
[Applause]	0
... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.	0
So important.	0
Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.	0
Every problem can be solved.	0
And every hurting family can find healing and hope.	0
Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?	0
[Applause]	0
On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.	0
[Applause]	0
My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave...	0
[Applause]	0
... to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.	0
[Applause]	0
True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.	0
An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.	0
Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan...	0
[Applause]	0
Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.	0
She was not expected to live past 5.	0
On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.	0
He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life.	0
Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.	0
[Applause]	0
Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.	0
But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.	0
If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A.	0
but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.	0
[Applause]	0
In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.	0
But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind — and the souls — of every American child.	0
Education is the civil rights issue of our time.	0
[Applause]	0
I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.	0
[Applause]	0
These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.	0
[Applause]	0
Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.	0
As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.	0
But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning — great learning center — with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.	0
Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.	0
Later this year, she will get her master's degree in social work.	0
We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.	0
[Applause]	0
But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.	0
The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.	0
[Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.]	0
In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.	0
This is not acceptable in our society.	0
[Applause]	0
Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.	0
[Applause]	0
But to create this future, we must work with — not against — not against — the men and women of law enforcement.	0
[Applause]	0
We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it's — really, it's what it is, division.	0
It's pure, unadulterated division.	0
We have to unify.	0
Police and sheriffs are members of our community.	0
They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.	0
We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.	0
[Applause]	0
And we must support the victims of crime.	0
I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.	0
The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media	0
[Fact check: They have received coverage.]	0
and silenced by special interests. Joining us...	0
[Applause]	0
Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.	0
Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis.	0
Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.	0
Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.	0
But he never got the chance.	0
His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.	0
Jamiel, thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.	0
Their husbands — Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis — were slain in the line of duty in California.	0
They were pillars of their community.	0
These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.	0
Should have never been in our country.	0
Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.	0
Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.	0
[Applause]	0
To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice.	0
Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.	0
We will always honor their memory.	0
[Applause]	0
Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war — if they must — they have to fight and they only have to win.	1
[Applause]	1
I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...	1
[Applause]	1
... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.	1
My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.	0
Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.	0
[Applause]	0
The challenges we face as a nation are great.	0
But our people are even greater.	0
And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.	0
[Applause]	0
"We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens."	0
Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.	0
[Applause]	0
I just spoke to our great General	0
[Jim]	0
"Mattis just now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ""Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy."""	0
Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
And Ryan is looking down right now.	0
You know that.	0
And he's very happy, because I think he just broke a record.	0
[Applause]	0
For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.	0
Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom.	0
And we will never forget Ryan.	0
[Applause]	0
To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.	0
Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.	0
It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism...	1
[Applause]	1
... and a Cold War and defeated communism.	1
[Applause]	1
But our partners must meet their financial obligations.	1
And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.	0
In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in.	0
Very nice.	0
[Applause]	0
We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost — have to do that.	0
We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations.	0
And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.	0
[Applause]	0
Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.	0
My job is not to represent the world.	0
My job is to represent the United States of America.	0
[Applause]	0
But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.	0
We must learn from the mistakes of the past.	0
We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world.	0
All across the world.	0
The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.	0
[Applause]	0
America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.	0
We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.	0
We want peace, wherever peace can be found.	0
America is friends today with former enemies.	0
Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars.	0
This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.	0
Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.	0
On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial.	0
At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations.	0
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.	0
Remington unveiled the first typewriter.	0
An early attempt was made at electric light.	0
Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.	0
Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.	0
[Applause]	0
Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.	0
Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.	0
American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.	0
Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.	0
And streets where mothers are safe from fear — schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow — are not too much to ask.	0
[Applause]	0
When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before, for all Americans.	0
This is our vision.	0
This is our mission.	0
But we can only get there together.	0
We are one people, with one destiny.	0
We all bleed the same blood.	0
We all salute the same great American flag.	0
And we are all made by the same God.	0
[Applause]	0
When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began.	0
The time for small thinking is over.	0
The time for trivial fights is behind us.	0
We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.	0
From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.	0
I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.	0
I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.	0
I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.	0
Believe in yourselves.	0
Believe in your future.	0
And believe, once more, in America.	0
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.	0
This Sunday, a rough week for both likely nominees.	0
For Hillary Clinton, it was that report contradicting her statements old and new about her emails.	0
Well, it was allowed.	0
And the rules have been clarified since I left.	0
For Donald Trump, it was an unprovoked attack on a popular Republican Latina governor, Susana Martinez of New Mexico.	0
She's not doing the job.	0
Hey, maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico.	0
This morning, my interview with the only candidate still viewed favorably by the voters, Bernie Sanders.	0
Would you take the call if Hillary Clinton asked you to be her running mate?	0
Plus, we've seen the Clinton/Trump polls tighten.	0
But how tight will they be if and when Sanders gets out?	0
We have a first look at the true state of the presidential race.	0
Also, before Donald, there was Arnold, the celebrity candidate who shocked the political world by running in California.	0
Arnold Schwarzenegger one on one, on the state of the Republican party in the age of Trump.	0
And joining me for insight and analysis are Robert Costa of The Washington Post, Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, Jerry Seib, Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, and Neera Tanden, president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.	0
Welcome to Sunday.	0
It's Meet the Press.	0
From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.	0
Good Sunday morning on this Memorial Day weekend.	0
In a moment, we'll bring you my interview with Bernie Sanders.	0
But this holiday weekend, we're going to pause to take a look at this head-scratching presidential race.	0
Let's admit up front, that every year, some people are upset at the major party choices that they have for president.	0
And it's always this hold-your-nose business, lesser of two evils, and we push through it.	0
But how did we get here?	0
How did we get to the point where on one side, Hillary Clinton would be the most unpopular nominee in history if not for the fact that Donald Trump is even more unpopular.	0
There are many possible answers to that question.	0
But it's undeniable that this week, both candidates seem to be doing whatever they could to make matters even worse.	0
And while we're all asking what does this mean for November, maybe we should start asking what does this mean for January.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Thank goodness for emails.	0
I love emails.	0
Frankly, what Hillary has done is criminal, folks.	0
It's criminal.	0
Donald Trump harping on the Clinton email scandal that just won't go away.	0
This week, a State Department inspector general said, Hillary Clinton did break the rules, that she never asked for permission to use a private server and would have been denied if she had.	0
The report contradicts what Clinton has said before and since.	0
Well, it was allowed and the rules have been clarified since I left about the practice.	0
The problem for Trump, he has his own transparency issue.	0
My question is really simple.	0
If you have paid federal income tax, show us.	0
Just 19 percent of voters give Clinton good ratings for being honest and straightforward.	0
But even fewer say Trump has the right temperament to be president.	0
Trump is putting Clinton's vulnerabilities on display.	0
Hillary is a disaster, folks.	0
She has bad judgment.	0
That was said by Bernie Sanders.	0
He's given me a lot of my best lines.	0
And Trump is trying to drag the Clintons back into the '90s, reminding voters of Bill Clinton's affairs and sexual misconduct.	0
Nobody, nobody, perhaps in the history of politics was worse to women or abused women more than Bill Clinton.	0
But Trump has had his own affairs.	0
Can you imagine how controversial I would be?	0
You think about him with the women, how 'bout me with the women?	0
This week, Trump exposed Republican divisions, mocking his party's most prominent Latina politician, New Mexico Governor, Susana Martinez.	0
She's not doing the job.	0
Hey, maybe I'll run for governor of New Mexico.	0
And infighting within his own campaign, firing his recently-hired political director.	0
Still, so far, Trump appears to be a candidate coated in Teflon.	0
Not so much for Clinton.	0
One difference is how each candidate deals with their vulnerabilities.	0
Trump almost embraces the attack.	0
I end up with a lawsuit and it ends up in San Diego, in federal court.	0
"And I figure, ""What the hell?"	0
Why not talk about it for two minutes?	0
Should I talk about it?	0
"Yes?"""	0
While Clinton struggles to explain.	0
The information that we had is out there, it's been clearly public.	0
And my email use was widely known.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Bernie Sanders of course is presenting himself as the more acceptable alternative to both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.	0
I got the chance to talk to him yesterday just after he held a rally in Santa Barbara, California, in advance, of course, of the June 7th California primary.	0
And I began by asking him about his difficult path to the Democratic nomination.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Let me start with a simple question, but maybe a complicated answer.	0
How do you win?	0
Senator Clinton has basically declared herself the nominee, the math is certainly very much in her favor.	0
Explain to me how you're the nominee in July in your head.	0
Fair question.	0
And I think there are three paths to victory.	0
Number one, I want to go into the convention with more pledged delegates than Secretary Clinton.	0
And that's going to be an uphill fight.	0
Because for 270 or so delegates, and we’ve got 46 percent of the pledged delegates.	0
What I want to do, and I think we can, is win California here, and win under the big vote, do very, very well in the other five states.	0
And I believe going into the convention, if we can do this, with the majority of pledged delegates, is a very symbolic victory.	0
"Second of all, we're going to talk to those superdelegates in states where we have won landslide victories, 60, 70, 80 percent of the vote, to say, ""Do what the people in your state want."	0
"They voted for Bernie Sanders, you as the superdelegates should follow their wishes."""	0
Third point and most important point, as you know Chuck, there are over 400 superdelegates who came onto secretary Clinton's campaign eight months before the first ballot was cast.	0
Before anybody else was in the race.	0
Before they could get a sense of what the campaign was about.	0
Right now, in every major poll, national poll and statewide poll done in the last month, six weeks, we are defeating Trump often by big numbers, and always at a larger margin than Secretary Clinton is.	0
"We're going to make the case to the superdelegates, ""Your job is to make sure that Trump is defeated, that Bernie Sanders, in fact, for a variety of reasons, not just polling, is the strongest candidate."	0
"Senator, in your answer there, you're basically contradicting yourself on the issue of superdelegates in this way: you're saying you want them to respect the vote in their state, then at the same time, you say, ""But oh, by the way, for those of you that are a superdelegate in a state that Clinton won, why don't you think about the general election?"""	0
It's a little bit hypocritical to be on both sides of those issues.	0
No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.	0
What I'm saying is, there are over 400 superdelegates who made a decision to vote for Secretary Clinton before anyone else was in the race.	0
Before they got a sense of what the campaign was about.	0
And all that I am saying is for those superdelegates who came onboard before I was even in the race, you have got the very grave responsibility to make sure that Trump does not become elected president of the United States.	0
Vote for the strongest candidate.	0
And it's not just the polls, Chuck.	0
If you look at the momentum and the energy and the enthusiasm of our grassroots campaign, it will result in a higher voter turnout.	0
And Democrats and progressives do well when the voter turnout is high.	0
Republicans do well when the voter turnout is low.	0
I think our message of income and wealth inequality, the fact that we're the only major country on earth not to have healthcare for all people is resonating.	0
It will win the general election.	0
Is it fair to say then if you don't win California, you believe your campaign is over?	0
No, that's what you said.	0
I didn't say.	0
What I said is obviously California is very, very important, 475 superdelegates.	0
Obviously, if we don't do well in California, it will make our path much much harder.	0
No question about it.	0
But I think we have a good chance to win in California, maybe win big, and maybe win four or five of the other states that are off on June 7th.	0
But without a California victory, you can't win a majority of pledged delegates.	0
And obviously, you will once again not succeed in a big state with a diverse population.	0
It's going to be hard for you to convince Democrats to go with you without a California victory.	0
Fair?	0
Hey, look, Chuck, California is the big enchilada, so to speak.	0
Obviously it is enormously important, and obviously we want to win it.	0
But let me just tell you something.	0
You know, my campaign has been written off from before we started.	0
Nobody thought we would do anything.	0
We've now won 20 states, primaries and caucuses, and I think by the end of the process, we may win half of the states.	0
So we're going to fight till the last vote is cast and try to appeal to the last delegate that we can.	0
Last week with me, Secretary Clinton said when it comes to party unity, she's doing her part, she's going to do her part.	0
But that there is a responsibility that falls on you as well.	0
If she's the nominee, that you have a responsibility to do what it takes to bring your supporters onboard with her.	0
Do you accept that responsibility?	0
Well, the responsibility that I accept in a very, very serious way is to do everything that I can to make sure that Donald Trump will not become elected president of the United States.	0
Donald Trump, for a dozen different reasons, would be a disaster as president.	0
I will do everything that I can to make sure that does not happen.	0
But at the end of the day, whether it's Secretary Clinton of Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump, anybody else, the way you gain support is through the candidate himself or herself.	0
So my job is to make sure that Trump does not become president.	0
And I will do that.	0
But if Secretary Clinton is the nominee, it is her job to reach out to millions of people and make the case as to why she is going to defend working families and the middle, provide healthcare for all people, take on Wall Street, deal aggressively with climate change.	0
That is the candidate's job to do.	0
I understand that.	0
But you just said you want to do whatever it takes to stop him.	0
"You don't believe you need to be out there telling your supporters, ""You may not be happy with Hillary Clinton, but she's better than him""?"	0
Well, no question about that.	0
No question about that.	0
But where my mind is right now is to do everything that I can in the remaining caucuses and primaries to try to win them and make the case.	0
But if your question is do I think that Secretary Clinton is significantly a better candidate for America than is Donald Trump, that is not a debate.	0
Of course that is true.	0
Do you think Hillary Clinton needs a clean bill of health from the F.B.I.	0
before she accepts the Democrat nomination?	0
Well, I have said many, many times that I'm trying to run a campaign based on the needs of the American people.	0
And that is raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, paid family and medical leave, making public colleges and universities tuition-free---	0
I understand that--	0
Those are the issues, by the way, that the American people are deeply concerned about.	0
But so I have not gotten into the email situation at all.	0
There is a process unfolding.	0
There's an investigation that is going on.	0
It will play out and we'll see what happens.	0
I understand that.	0
But do you think for the Democratic party and for superdelegates, do you think it's important for them to find out what the F.B.I.	0
's going to do before the vote in Philadelphia?	0
Well, that's not the decision of superdelegates or anybody else.	0
That's the decision of the F.B.I..	0
I have no idea when they are going to make their report public or come up with their conclusions.	0
But do I think that whenever that happens, if it happens, that that will be an issue that Donald Trump and the Republicans will seize on?	0
I think there is little doubt about that.	0
You know, you told The Wall Street Journal in November that if Clinton's email practices foiled public records requests, or compromised classified information, that those were valid questions.	0
Well, the State Department I.G.	0
Report said just that.	0
What was your reaction to that report, and does that trouble you?	0
Does that add to your list of issues that you believe she has a judgment problem then?	0
Well, again, you know, these are areas that I have stayed away from.	0
There is a process, people will draw their conclusions from the inspector general report.	0
But again, you know, I think the American people are tired of that type of politics.	0
And I think the media and the candidates have got to talk about why the middle class is in decline and why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.	0
Those issues are more important to the American people than some of the issues you have been talking about.	0
And those are the issues that I focus on.	0
I just gave an hour speech right here in Santa Barbara, it wasn't about emails, it was about the future of the American middle class and how we deal with the fundamental problems that they are facing.	0
Do you have a problem when some of your supporters are quoted in The New York Times saying they're sort of rooting for an F.B.I.	0
indictment when it comes to Clinton?	0
Do you tell your supporters not to talk that way?	0
I'll tell you, I have a real problem with The New York Times, which from day one, has been trying to be dismissive of our campaign and be very negative about our campaign.	0
You can go out and you can talk to millions of people and you any get response that you want.	0
Our campaign is about defeating Secretary Clinton on the real issues.	0
I want to break up the Wall Street banks.	1
She doesn't.	0
I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.	1
She wants $12 an hour.	1
I voted against the War in Iraq.	0
She voted for the War in Iraq.	1
I believe we should ban fracking.	1
She does not.	0
I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change.	0
That is not her position.	0
Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on that The New York Times goes around, when they talk to a handful of people and do a front-page story, that's a problem for The New York Times, not for my campaign.	0
All right, I want to ask you a little bit about the platform and the Democratic party issues platform that's coming up.	0
A couple of your appointees, when it comes to the issue of Israel, including Cornel West, he refers to the Palestinians as “the plight of an occupied people.” Do you agree with his characterization?	0
What I believe is that the United States is going to be playing on a level playing field in dealing with Israel and the Palestinian people.	0
I am 100 percent pro Israel in the sense of Israel's right to exist, I lived in Israel, I have family in Israel, Israel has the right to live not only in peace and security, but to know that their very existence will be protected by the United States government.	0
On the other hand, I think if we're looking at lasting peace in the Middle East, the United States has got to respect the needs of the Palestinian people.	0
They cannot be pushed aside.	0
So that is my view.	0
And, you know, other people can say whatever they want.	0
That is my view.	0
What do you want the platform to say?	0
Do you want to refer to the Palestinians as an occupied people?	0
Do you want to say that Israel is occupying Gaza?	0
Well, we're a little bit early about worrying about the wording of what the Democratic platform will be.	0
We've got some good people on our platform-writing committee.	0
But I think at the end of the day, there will be a general recognition by the entire Democratic convention, that of course Israel's right to exist in peace and security is not in debate.	0
But on the other hand, the Palestinian people's needs must also be respected.	0
I have the feeling that while the media wants to make this into a great conflict, I think there's going to be broad consensus within the Democratic convention on that issue.	0
Fair enough.	0
Final question, on Friday, you warned Secretary Clinton that if she ends up the nominee, that her running mate essentially better not be a conservative or moderate type of Democrat if she wants to win over your supporters and certainly have your enthusiastic support.	0
Do you consider someone like Tim Kaine falling into that category, the Virginia senator, that he's too conservative or moderate to be on the Democratic ticket?	0
Again, Chuck, I don't want to shock you, but I think we are once again into a little bit of speculation.	0
I have known Tim Kaine for years.	0
I really like him very much.	0
My point was, and let me repeat it, that for Democrats to win, they're going to have to address the needs of working people.	0
They're going to have to address the needs of the middle class.	0
And that means standing up to Wall Street, standing up to the greed of corporate America.	0
Even now and then, standing up to the media.	0
And that means having a candidate who can excite working families, excite young people, bring them into the political process, create a large voter turnout.	0
And when we do that, we're going to win the election.	0
So I would hope, if I am not the nominee, that the vice presidential candidate will not be from Wall Street, will be somebody who has a history of standing up and fighting for working families, taking on the drug companies whose greed is doing so much harm, taking on Wall Street, taking on corporate America, and fight for a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent.	0
Would you take the call if Hillary Clinton asked you to be her running mate?	0
Well, right now, again, here we are in California, I'm knocking my brains out to win the Democratic nomination.	0
Yes you are.	0
That's where I am right now.	0
What happens afterwards, we will see.	0
But right now, my focus is on winning the nomination.	0
Well, that was a very political type of answer that says you're not answering the question.	0
Fair enough, you're not ruling it out.	0
What I am saying right now is our focus is on winning the Democratic nomination.	0
All right.	0
Senator Bernie Sanders from Santa Barbara, California, thanks for coming on.	0
Stay safe on the trail, sir.	0
Thank you very much.	0
(END TAPE)	0
And later in the broadcast, my interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger, on the state of the Republican party in the age of Trump.	0
Meanwhile, throughout the morning on this Memorial Day weekend, we're going to honor the men and women in uniform who have died in the past year in service to our country, starting with conflict zones like Afghanistan.	0
And we are back, panel is here.	0
Jerry Seib, Washington Bureau Chief with The Wall Street Journal, my partner with the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Neera Tanden, president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress and a member of the platform committee for Hillary Clinton.	0
Republican pollster and strategist Kellyanne Conway, and Robert Costa of The Washington Post.	0
Welcome all.	0
Neera, since you are somebody that the Hillary Clinton campaign has appointed to this, Bernie Sanders, is that still an opponent, an aggressive opponent of Hillary Clinton?	0
The Bernie Sanders you just heard?	0
I thought he made a lot of great points about Democratic unity.	0
I welcome that.	0
I mean, he does seem to really focus on the general election, which will be against Donald Trump.	0
And I think he made clear that that is the paramount concern for Democrats.	0
We face a person who's sort of unprecedented in history in this general election.	0
And I think he'll be clear about that when this primary's over into June.	0
Yeah, that sounds great, but it's not true.	0
I mean, he is running--to me Senator Sanders is the most aggressive against Secretary Clinton he's been in the year he's been running here--	0
I just disagree.	0
Okay, well, he's won 20 states, ten million voters and counting.	0
Sure, sure.	0
And he now wants to kick off your platform committee, members like Barney Frank, and former congressmen and Governor Malloy.	0
He's in open warfare with the Democratic National Committee.	0
He didn't look like open warfare there to me, I must say.	0
Then why doesn't he drop out?	0
Because he wants--	0
He said he promises a messy convention in Philadelphia.	0
And look, so look as Bernie Sanders is playing Robin to Donald Trump's Batman, these guys are waging a two-front war, street fight against Hillary Clinton--	0
Absolutely.	0
I hear that.	0
I hear that.	0
And that is definitely why her negatives are where they are.	0
But--	0
Unity--	0
But the point here is that I was on Hillary Clinton's campaign eight years ago, and it was a hard-fought campaign at this point.	0
And then just as the primary ended, Hillary endorsed Obama and was a strong champion for him and united the party.	0
But--	0
And there's nothing in what he said--	0
I thought what I heard in that interview was the terms of the merger being negotiated.	0
You know, here's what it’s going to take.	0
You've got to be respectful of me--	0
Very Wall Street Journal of you, by the way, in terms of the merger.	0
We all play to stereotypes, don’t we?	0
Got to be respectful to my people, you've got to give me some things on the platform, and you've got to pick a vice presidential nominee that I can say that I can live with.	0
"But what he didn't say when you asked him, ""Do you have some responsibility for making your supporters back Hillary Clinton ultimately,"" he wouldn't go there."	0
"Now maybe it's too early, but that's the real question for me, is will he tell his people, ""You've got to go there,"" or will he back off?"	0
NEERA TANDEN	0
I think he's already doing that.	0
I think he's already doing that by what he said here.	0
And he seems pretty confident, the senator, when it comes to the platform, that he's going to get some of his people on this committee.	0
But the way he answered the Tim Kaine question, he praised Senator Kaine, but this was not an enthusiastic embrace.	0
I think he's still waiting to spend his political capital on the running mate.	0
He wants a progressive in there.	0
He thinks this is the way he shaped the campaign.	0
It's not just about the platform.	0
It's about who's on the ticket, should he not win the nomination.	0
Look, part of this week though, by the way, is there is now handwringing in Democratic party world.	0
"And I will give Robby Mook his quote, the quote of the day this morning, the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, ""It wouldn't be a general election without some early bedwetting from Washington insiders."""	0
But there's a reason.	0
Present company excluded.	0
Exactly.	0
There's a reason for it, Jerry Seib, and it's how she's dealt with the email controversy.	0
Here's a compilation of just Thursday.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
I know people have concerns about this.	0
I understand that.	0
But I think voters are going to be looking at the full picture of what I have to offer.	0
You know, the fact is, people have official accounts, they have personal accounts, and when it comes to personal, people don’t want their personal email accounts made public.	0
It was allowed, and the rules have been clarified since I left about the practice.	0
"(END TAPE) The New York Times editorial board, Bernie Sanders' favorite newspaper these days, """	0
[T]	0
he nation should not be judging leadership as a measure of who is less untrustworthy.	0
Mrs. Clinton has to answer questions about the report thoroughly and candidly.	0
"That is her best path back to the larger task of campaigning for the presidency."""	0
They don't want to do this, Jerry.	0
No, they don't.	0
I mean, and I think that the hope is that it would go away.	0
But I also think the belief is that the candid answers continue to get her into trouble.	0
"But I tend to agree that with the word candidly in there, the best way to approach this probably is to just say, ""Look, here's what happened."	0
You all know what happened.	0
There's no mystery left in this.	0
I did this because I did want some privacy for my email accounts.	0
"It was a mistake, let's move on."""	0
Now, that probably won't be sufficient.	0
Look, we all know the big issue yet to come isn't what the inspector general of the State Department said, it's what the Justice Department says ultimately.	0
And what happens when she's interviewed by the F.B.I., which is almost certain to happen.	0
But it's not just the answer, it's how Secretary Clinton answers.	0
And what we saw this week was her insert herself more into the national political conversation.	0
Maybe taking a cue from Donald Trump.	0
She's appearing on different programs, she's calling into shows.	0
She's trying to not just have some rote answers.	0
She knows this is going to be a combative general election and she has to be in the arena.	0
But I have to say, and I'm curious what your guys' take on this is, the two different ways they deal with their baggage.	0
Here's Donald Trump who actually decided to talk about Trump University and he attacks the judge.	0
Here he is.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump.	0
A hater.	0
He's a hater.	0
His name is Gonzalo Curiel.	0
They ought to look into Judge Curiel, because what Judge Curiel is doing is a total disgrace, okay?	0
But we'll come back in November.	0
Wouldn't that be wild?	0
If I'm president and I come back to do a civil case?	0
(END TAPE)	0
"Kellyanne, when you attack a federal judge that's in the middle of dealing with a case you're involved in, you might get headlines like this one in The Washington Post, ""Judge bashed by Trump orders release of company records."""	0
And suddenly, in the next two weeks, there's going to be a whole lot more Trump University.	0
Now he does handle his baggage a lot differently than Hillary Clinton does.	0
But will it eventually catch up to him?	0
No.	0
And ask the 16 Republicans who ran against him in the primaries.	0
And we see Hillary and her surrogates really recycling those same arguments, including Trump University.	0
Here's something Donald Trump has mastered, which is very surprising to all of us in the political class.	0
"For somebody who's never run for office before, he understands that old axiom, ""Define yourself before you're defined."""	0
And he puts all of this out there, Chuck, himself so that when the voters hear it for the 15th time, it doesn't strike them as brand new information.	0
The inspector general's report, brand new information.	0
And let me just say this one other thing about Hillary and the inspector general's report.	0
It's a very unusual place for her because she does best when she can blame the vast right-wing conspiracy for her perils.	0
This is the inspector general of the State Department of the Obama administration.	0
This is his justice department looking at this.	0
All right.	0
Neera, I'll give you a chance to respond.	0
I know you want to.	0
Where can you respond?	0
I mean, we did have a lot of news this week, right, about Donald Trump.	0
And I would say you're right, that he was able to defeat the Republican primary.	0
But that does not mean that he will do well in the general election, because he has the highest negatives of anyone.	0
He has, just this week, we've learned all kinds of new information about him, including what we'll learn next week, he'll never return his taxes, he was betting on the housing crisis, essentially.	0
And I think the idea that he's Teflon is ridiculous, when he has the highest negatives of anyone running for president ever--	0
Neera do you know what he's got that Hillary doesn't have?	0
He's actually the nominee of his party.	0
And she's not.	0
Yes, and she will soon.	0
All right.	0
She will be.	0
And then we'll see how united the party--	0
Tell the 10 million Sanders voters that.	0
We will take a pause, because you guys will be returning.	0
We'll be back in a moment with a man who knows a little something about running for office as a celebrity outsider.	0
My interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger, about Donald Trump and his new poll in advance of the June 7th California primary.	0
And as we go to break, we continue to honor those service members who have died in conflict zones just in the last year.	0
More from Afghanistan.	0
And welcome back.	0
This election isn't the first time someone well known for being an entertainer found himself in a position of political power.	0
In fact, the state of California has brought a few of them to us, including song-and-dance man George Murphy, who became a U.S.	0
Senator.	0
And of course, Ronald Reagan, you may have heard of him.	0
You could say that our next guest helped prep this generation for taking an entertainer seriously as a political player.	0
Arnold Schwarzenegger served as the governor of California from 2003 to 2011 and he joins me now.	0
Governor Schwarzenegger, welcome back to Meet the Press.	0
Thank you, Chuck.	0
It's wonderful to be back.	0
You know, this has been a year for outsider candidates.	0
It's obviously something you're familiar with.	0
Many people have made some comparisons of your candidacy in 2003 and Donald Trump's today.	0
What similarities do you see and what are the differences?	0
Well, I don't really study that much of what is the difference between Donald Trump and my candidacy.	0
I study much more the field polls and USC Schwarzenegger polls that were just done about what do the people really think.	0
And what is the main interest in the people's minds when you have our election now on June 6th, so that is really - or June 7th I should say.	0
This is really my interest.	0
And this is why we did the poll and this is why we really came up with these wonderful studies.	0
And they're quite interesting.	0
I think when you look at it, the important thing that comes out of that is that 69 percent of the people want our politicians to work together.	0
And I think this should be a message to Democrats and Republicans to work together.	0
And this is why people are very upset about Washington today.	0
You know, I want to play something that you said in 2004 about what made you a Republican.	0
And then find out if that still holds today.	0
Here it is.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Then I heard Nixon speak.	0
He was talking about free enterprise, getting the government off your back, lowering the taxes and strengthening the military.	0
Listening to Nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air.	0
"I said to my friend, I said, ""What party is he?"""	0
"My friend said, ""He's a Republican."""	0
"I said, ""Then I am a Republican."""	0
(END TAPE)	0
Can you comfortably say that today with Donald Trump as the standard bearer for the Republican party?	0
I comfortably can say that I am a Republican and I always will be a Republican because the Republican party is a big tent and there was not always things that I agreed with or they didn't agree with me many times.	0
But the fact of the matter is that's the philosophy, and everything that I've heard is exactly the same.	0
And I think that what is more important about it is not what do I think about Donald Trump.	0
We have to talk about the bigger issue.	0
And this is what do the people really feel.	0
And the fascinating thing about the poll was that both Democrats and Republicans found that the most important is to really improve the economy and to create more jobs.	0
They were all sensing when it comes to social security, to save social security and to really take care of public schools.	0
And they're concerned about the public education in general.	0
And those are the kind of issues that Democrats and Republicans are concerned about.	0
Of course they have different ways of solving this problem, and depending if they're Democrat or Republicans.	0
Well, let me just ask it straight forward.	0
Are you ready to support Donald Trump for president?	0
I know you're a John Kasich supporter, you went and campaigned for him.	0
Are you going to support Trump?	0
And will you go to the convention in Cleveland?	0
Chuck, as I said, to me the most important thing is now to talk about the latest poll numbers and how the people of California feel and how the people in America basically feel.	0
Because I think it is important that we go and bring both of the parties together.	0
"The more we go to the left, the more we go to the right, I believe of what President Eisenhower said, ""Politics is like the road."	0
"The left and the right represents the gutter, and the middle is drivable."""	0
And I think this is exactly where the action is, is in the middle.	0
I have seen it when I was governor of the state of California.	0
I have seen it firsthand, that the only way we brought Democrats and Republicans together, we could really solve very important issues.	0
I remember that's how we really started rebuilding California and invested $60 billion in infrastructure.	0
That's when we go and created the AB 32 where we made a commitment to reducing our greenhouse gasses to 25 percent by the year 2020, where we upped our renewables and all this great stuff that is happening when both of the parties work together.	0
Governor, I can't help but notice though, you're avoiding saying anything about Trump.	0
You're not saying you're for him, you're not saying you're against him.	0
You're trying to stay out of it.	0
I get it.	0
But is that what you're trying to do here?	0
By you not saying anything, you're actually making a statement.	0
No, not really, because I try to stay focused.	0
Remember, there's one thing that I've liked over the years when I've promoted bodybuilding and fitness and my movies and politics and issues and so on is to stay focused.	0
So today I want to talk about our poll numbers.	0
Now polls that we have taken, the field polls that the USC Schwarzenegger Institute released this last week and I want to talk about that, because that is really important for the state of California.	0
It's important that the people know how they feel and in which direction to go, and it also will help the candidates to listen to the people carefully, and not to deviate from that and to really talk about those very important issues, since we have the primaries coming up in California, I think the presidential candidates, whoever they are, have to address those issues.	0
And finally, I want to ask you a question about your native country Austria.	0
Because what was fascinating is you could argue that they had an election which it came down to somebody from the far left, maybe similar to a Bernie Sanders, and someone from the far right, a nativist of sorts.	0
And nobody was happy with their choices.	0
All of a sudden, this country is experiencing an appeal of a socialist and the appeal of a nativist.	0
What lessons do you think Americans should take away from this?	0
I think that it is pretty much in many different countries I've seen that, that they're looking for an outsider and people are dissatisfied with the status quo.	0
And people are dissatisfied basically with the action that is being created in those capitalists.	0
The politicians are not keeping their promises, and politicians don't solve the problems.	0
"And this is why you see in our poll numbers that 69 percent of the people say, ""The politicians have to work together."""	0
That is the most important thing.	0
And they have to come to a compromise.	0
And in Washington, not much is getting done.	0
Some of it is getting done, but not much.	0
And I think that to spend billions of dollars on the capital, and it is the worst investment, because nothing is getting done.	0
So therefore, the people are looking for something else.	0
And they don't know where to turn to.	0
And so this is what you see in America and this is what you have seen in Austria and this is what you see in Germany and this is what you see in France.	0
And you see this all over the place.	0
All right, I'm going to ask you one last time.	0
Do you plan on publicly saying whether you'll be for Trump?	0
I will make an announcement before the election, you can be sure of that.	0
But I will do it my way.	0
Which is always an unusual way.	0
As you remember that I announced my candidacy for governor on The Tonight Show.	0
So that was very unusual, and I will do exactly the same thing also with the endorsement.	0
So I will study the various different candidates, what they represent, all that stuff, and I will then make up my mind and I would make the endorsement.	0
So I will make an endorsement, but it will not be here, because then that would be the headline.	0
Well, and I guess you're saying we're too usual of a place to do this, we're not unusual enough.	0
Anyway, Governor Schwarzenegger, it's pleasure sir, thanks for coming on.	0
Thank you very much for having me.	0
Appreciate it.	0
When we come back, is the Clinton-Trump race really as close as the latest polls indicate?	0
We've got some new data that suggests one of the candidates may soon get a very nice bump.	0
That's next.	0
And we are back.	0
It's data download time.	0
So how much is Bernie Sanders hurting Hillary Clinton?	0
Democrats, of course, still locked in their primary battle.	0
Republicans starting to get behind their nominee.	0
And recent polls of course have shown an increasingly tight race.	0
So the question is, is this tightness something that's going to last till November or is this a current Sanders phenomenon?	0
Meaning, Bernie Sanders supporters aren't coming home to the Democrats?	0
Well if history's any guide, we think that's what it is.	0
Clinton should pick up about 70 percent of the current people right now that say they're for Sanders against Trump but not yet ready to vote for Clinton.	0
Call them the Sanders-only voters.	0
We'll show you what they could mean.	0
Let's start with our latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.	0
We see a close race between Clinton and Trump, 46-43, that's margin of error stuff.	0
While Sanders, double-digit lead against Trump, 54-39.	0
It's an eight-point gap between Clinton and Sanders, so what happens if Clinton gets about 70 percent of that difference if you leave Trump's number as is.	0
Well, Clinton's lead would jump five points to 51-43.	0
Same phenomenon in other polls.	0
CBS/New York Times, they have Clinton starting with a six-point lead over Trump, they of course had Sanders up double digits as well, 51-38.	0
But if you shift the support from Sanders, Clinton would pick up another three points, and the lead would increase to nine, 50-41.	0
Finally, we'll show you what happens in the Fox News poll, where Clinton actually trailed Trump by three points, 45-42, Sanders led Trump in their poll, 46-42.	0
Well, you do the same thing, 70 percent of those Sanders-only voters, Clinton would poll even, to 45-45.	0
The point is, Sanders is hurting Clinton right now.	0
By the way, in 2008, Barack Obama picked up, you guessed it, three points against John McCain in the first NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll after Hillary Clinton dropped out.	0
Look, the polls between Clinton and Trump are tight right now.	0
That's not a surprise.	0
But it gives you an idea that if Democrats do rally around their nominee, what the race may look like just before the conventions begin.	0
We'll see if that actually happens though.	0
Sanders supporters don't seem ready to move just yet.	0
We'll be back in a moment.	0
Let me bring the panel back.	0
You know, the biggest political story of the month may be taking place right now in Orlando, the Libertarian Party Convention.	0
"Don't laugh, I know, because their place on the ballot, they could be ""none of the above,"" if that's possible."	0
And in fact, we noted, we actually put a battleground map together of what would happen if you have a third-party candidacy like the Libertarians who can get 10 percent.	0
So here's the initial battleground map, here the states that we know will be in play no matter what, those are in purple there, ten states in there.	0
If the Libertarians can get ten, we think these three red states, Arizona, Missouri, and Indiana, suddenly come into play perhaps for Clinton.	0
And then we've got two blue states to put in Minnesota and Maine, under the same scenario that those are states that suddenly get put into play for Trump.	0
Jerry, do you think the Libertarians are going to make a splash this year?	0
I think they could.	0
"As you know, in our polling, Wall Street Journal/NBC News, or NBC News/Wall Street Journal as you call it, we found that there were so many respondents asked about a choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who were responding, ""I won't vote in that race,"" that we had to create a new answer."	0
If those people find someplace else to go, even if it's only to make a statement, it could be a significant enough number to tip some states.	0
And that matters.	0
Kellyanne, are you nervous about the Libertarians hurting Trump?	0
Yes, because I think Hillary Clinton can get to 43, 44 percent before she gets out of bed in the morning, but getting her to 51 percent in a two-person race seems to be roiling her.	0
So yes, if they grab some votes.	0
"But this convention, based on the public reports, I mean, Bill Welds as vice president running mates has had a hard time,"" he's confusing Libertarian with liberal Republicans."	0
So I think the party--	0
What's interesting--you do that.	0
You gave me a segue.	0
Let me first show you, there is a primary of sorts that is taking place.	0
They had a debate last night.	0
First let me give you a little of Gary Johnson, the 2012 nominee, former New Mexico Republican governor, who is trying to be the mainstream Libertarian nominee this time.	0
Here was him yesterday.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
The Libertarian Party is growing.	0
What I'd like to do is I'd like to fill up your current weekly meeting that's occurring in the treehouse to an auditorium.	0
Here it is, we're at a threshold here, a real threshold to grow this party and to make it better.	0
(END TAPE)	0
So that's Gary Johnson's argument.	0
Here's a compilation of some of his opponents that were on that debate stage.	0
I believe in a world where gay, married couples can protect their marijuana fields with fully-automatic machine guns, baby.	0
As a physician, I think it's a very good idea to have two separate bathrooms, one for people who wash their hands, and one for people who don't.	0
Everything should be as legal as tomatoes.	0
I think people are smart enough to know not to give heroin to a child unless under the direct supervision of a doctor.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Robert, there actually is a real chance what Kellyanne was bringing where Gary Johnson could get rejected by his party, and the Libertarians then suddenly are not a factor.	0
He could.	0
When I was on Capitol Hill this week, he talked to some members of the House and Republican senators.	0
And they were inching close to the idea of maybe supporting the Libertarian ticket.	0
But then they watched these candidates, they watched this convention, and they realized it's an imperfect vessel.	0
And this is a problem for many of these never-Trump Republicans.	0
They’re considering Libertarian but they just don't fit into that culture.	0
Neera, where do you think this sort of neither, the none-of-the-above vote goes?	0
Does it go to greens and Libertarians and sort of split?	0
Do they not show up?	0
Does turnout actually go down, not up?	0
I think actually a lot of the negativity of this race is designed to lower turnout.	0
And I think that's actually Trump's strategy, to be so negative about everything that he actually lowers Democratic turnout.	0
But I think, look, going into this race, it's a crazy year.	0
So if it's not Johnson and somebody else, I think that still could attract some Republicans, even though you would think that some of these statements would disqualify them.	0
You know, we shouldn't forget, there's another place the none-of-the-above vote can go, and that's to the Green party.	0
And that some of the Sanders voters could drift there, just again, to make a statement.	0
That's a potential problem.	0
Yeah, we have a history there with Democrats, which is Ralph Nader.	0
And a lot of people feel like Ralph Nader actually is turning the election towards--that Republicans don't have.	0
Because you look at Trump as a non-interventionist on foreign policy, and some of those Ron Paul, Rand Paul supporters have drifted toward Trump because they see the main Republican party as too hawkish.	0
Actually, Kellyanne, I could make an argument he’s more -- Trump would be more comfortable in the Libertarian party than he would in the Republican.	0
Well, but that's because the Libertarians are comfortable with Trump as their nominee.	0
And I think they will be.	0
Look, none of the above, this year is no more outsiders, it's who is the change agent.	0
And I don't think there's a single hidden Hillary vote in the country.	0
I think there are many hidden Trump votes.	0
People who just don't want to engage at the cappuccino counter or water cooler --	0
It's a fascinating debate.	0
I've had people swear to me there's hidden Hillary votes on the right.	0
There aren't.	0
Hidden Trump votes on the left.	0
We'll find out in November.	0
We'll see.	0
We'll be back, 45 seconds, endgame segment, with a look at what a Trump/Sanders debate might have looked like had it happened.	0
And a quick programming note, my colleague Richard Engel got rare access into America's drone warfare operation.	0
And a sit-down with the C.I.A.	0
Director John Brennan to talk about our country's drone strategy.	0
You can watch that report on On Assignment, which airs tonight at 7:00 Eastern, 6:00 Central on NBC.	0
We'll be right back.	0
Endgame time, panel is here.	0
You know, there was another player in the Trump/Clinton campaign this week, and it was President Obama, overseas in Japan, historic visit, by the way, to Hiroshima.	0
But he was asked about what foreign leaders at the G7 meeting are saying about Donald Trump.	0
Here's what he said.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
It's fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee.	0
They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements.	0
But they're rattled by it.	0
And for good reason.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Jerry, there's a couple of unusual things about that statement.	0
Number one, that he did it overseas.	0
And there was some criticism was that appropriate or not.	0
At the same time, Trump embraced the attack.	0
Yeah, exactly, well, which is what Donald Trump does.	0
But A) you do hear that a fair amount from people who go overseas, U.S. officials and business leaders, frankly, do tell me that they get the same thing.	0
B) it also suggests to you that Barack Obama is raring to go to campaign for Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump.	0
He does not want his legacy to be named Donald Trump.	0
"Well, except I thought the most remarkable thing President Obama said later on there was that the quote ""eventual Democratic nominee,"" leaving open the possibility that it may not be Hillary Clinton."	0
So I didn't hear him say that he's campaigning for Hillary Clinton and he's endorsed her.	0
He said the eventual Democratic nominee, why?	0
We'll see in a few weeks.	0
I think he went through his own experience, which is we had a long Democratic primary eight years ago, and then Hillary was really unified with him.	0
And I expect President Obama to be campaigning, and the fact that his numbers are up now is going to be very helpful.	0
That’s what’s--	0
We talk about the Bernie Sanders bump in the polling, and once President Obama gets and the campaign trail--	0
Endorses Hillary.	0
No question.	0
And you see the Republican party, the elders in the Republican party are just not with Trump in a significant way.	0
And that's been amazing, as President Obama, nobody maybe has benefited more from this topsy-turvy primary campaign than Barack Obama.	0
Or Donald Trump.	0
Right.	0
And the Clinton campaign people, you know this Neera, will tell you that most of the Trump rise in the polls in the last few weeks has been consolidation of the Republican vote.	0
That's the biggest portion of his rise.	0
And she will get her share of that when there's a consolidation on the Democratic side.	0
How big, we'll find out.	0
Right.	0
You might see Donald Trump's high-water mark, 42 percent, 43 percent, 44 percent.	0
She has a lot more room to move.	0
But it may be the case.	0
We do have two conventions.	0
And it's like, you know, I think we know where the race will be right before the convention, the question is where is it going to be after.	0
But we're not going to get Trump/Sanders debate, but we thought we'd put together a facsimile.	0
Here it is.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
We're going to run against crazy Bernie.	0
Donald Trump is toast.	0
This socialist-slash-communist.	0
It is not a wild, socialist idea.	0
He's a crazy man.	0
But he claims, he claims to be a billionaire.	0
A lot of the Bernie Sanders people have said they're voting for Trump.	0
We defeat Donald Trump by very large numbers.	0
Big, big, huge victory.	0
A huge voter turnout.	0
Huge victories all over the place.	0
Huge, and I mean huge.	0
(END TAPE)	0
09:57:37;06 Pay-per-view, would you have paid?	0
Oh yeah.	0
Yeah?	0
Oh yeah.	0
In a minute.	0
Whatever it's worth, 25 bucks?	0
I think so.	0
And Hillary would have been the odd man out.	0
But yet it didn't happen.	0
I wonder why it didn't happen.	0
I don't understand, Robert, why didn't Trump say yes to this?	0
Trump's explanation is that he doesn't want to go against someone he thinks is going to come in second in the Democratic race.	0
But Trump's a showman.	0
I'm surprised it didn't happen.	0
I was stunned.	0
Sanders is a good debater.	0
Maybe he recognized that he couldn't handle it.	0
A lot of downside in that for Donald Trump I think.	0
I don't know.	0
The only person that was the loser was going to be--	0
Hillary Clinton.	0
Hillary Clinton.	0
No, I don’t think so.	0
I don’t think so--	0
--But doesn’t it show you the kind of populism that's popular out there?	0
Well, we shall see.	0
Oh well.	0
Maybe for another campaign here.	0
That's all for today though.	0
We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.	0
This Sunday, a $353,000 ticket to a Hillary Clinton fundraiser.	0
My exclusive interview with the host of that event, George Clooney.	0
advertisement	0
I think it's an obscene amount of money.	0
And it's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics.	0
George Clooney on Clinton, Trump, and all that money in politics.	0
But I think there is a difference between the Koch brothers and us.	0
Plus, the Republican party at war with itself.	0
This is a rigged system, folks.	0
The Republican system is a rigged system.	0
advertisement	0
The Trump campaign is trying to be more disciplined.	0
But is it too late for the candidate to change the script?	0
Republican chairman Reince Priebus joins me.	0
"Also, North Carolina's new so-called ""bathroom"" law."	0
Does it discriminate against the L.G.B.T.	0
community?	0
I'll ask the governor, Pat McCrory, if he now regrets signing a bill that has cost is state so much money.	0
And joining me for insight and analysis are MSNBC's Chris Matthews, Kathleen Parker of The Washington Post, radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt, and Perry Bacon of NBC News.	0
Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.	0
From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.	0
Good Sunday morning.	0
Donald Trump got wiped out in the delegate race in yet another state yesterday.	0
In Wyoming, Ted Cruz won all the delegates that were up for grabs at yesterday's Wyoming state convention.	0
"Now Trump says it would have been a waste of time and money for him to campaign there, claiming, ""The system is rigged,"" and that the Republican establishment is simply trying to take the nomination away from him."	0
We're going to get to that story later in the show.	0
But we're going to begin with the Democrats and the intersection of money, politics, and Hollywood.	0
And my surprisingly frank conversation with George Clooney.	0
Last night in Los Angeles, and the night before in San Francisco, George and Amal Clooney hosted fundraisers for Hillary Clinton, where the top ticket sets you back $353,000.	0
For that price, you got to sit at the same table with Hillary Clinton and the Clooneys.	0
It was very much an event for the 1 percent of the 1 percent.	0
This big-money fundraiser did not escape the attention of the Bernie Sanders campaign or his supporters who last night threw dollar bills, real ones, at Clinton's motorcade.	0
advertisement	0
Sanders, of course, has made opposing Wall Street and money in politics the centerpiece of his campaign.	0
I got a chance yesterday to talk to George Clooney from his home outside of L.A. And he was very open and candid about what he thought about all that money that is pouring into campaigns at events like the one he hosted.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Mr. Clooney, welcome to MeetthePress.	0
Thank you, Chuck.	0
Let me start with dinner you co-hosted on Friday night, a big fundraiser.	0
I know that you have plans for later tonight.	0
"Do you look at how much is being raised and, I think the cost of the friday night dinner $353,000 a couple to be a co-chair, do you look at it yourself and think, ""That's an obscene amount of money?"""	0
Yes.	0
I think it's an obscene amount of money.	0
I think that, you know, we had some protesters last night when we pulled up in San Francisco and they're right to protest.	0
They're absolutely right.	0
It is an obscene amount of money.	0
The Sanders campaign when they talk about it is absolutely right.	0
It's ridiculous that we should have this kind of money in politics.	0
I agree completely.	0
advertisement	0
You know, it was interesting.	0
We caught, our camera caught you having a conversation with the protesters last night.	0
What did you say to them?	0
Well, it was a funny thing.	0
I went over to try to talk to them and you said I was some corporate shill which, you know, me that's one of the funnier things you could say about me.	0
"And then he just said, you know, ""You sucked as Batman."""	0
"And I was like, ""Well, you kind of got me on that one."""	0
And then I walked away and that was basically it.	0
But, you know, I think what's important and what I think the Clinton campaign has not been very good at explaining is this and this is the truth: the overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for President, it's going to the down-ticket.	1
It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress.	0
And the reason that's important and the reason it's important to me is because we need, I'm a Democrat so if you're a Republican, you're going to disagree but we need to take the senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again.	0
And that's why I'm doing it.	0
So you don't enjoy doing these fundraisers?	0
No, I don't think anybody does.	0
I don't even think politicians do.	0
You know, I'm sure you've covered them before.	0
It's not the most fun thing to do.	0
You know, I spend probably a quarter of my time now raising millions and millions of dollars to fund my foundation which is basically chasing and looking for money that these corrupt politicians all around the world are hiding.	0
The Panama papers have been actually incredibly helpful.	0
We have forensic accountants so this is all a very big part of things that are important to me.	0
I really want Citizens United.	0
I think it's the worst, one of the worst laws passed, since I've been around.	0
You know, Bernie Sanders, obviously you've noted that his campaign was criticizing this and he was asked about your fundraiser specifically and he tried he backed off and he said this:	0
It's not a criticism of Clooney; it's a criticism of corrupt campaign finance system where big money interests and it's not Clooney, it's the people who are coming to this event that end up having undue influence over the political process.	0
Do you think people that are coming to your event tonight and went last night, that they think they're gonna get extra access to Hillary Clinton, to a President Clinton?	0
No.	0
I actually don't think that's true.	0
I think there is a difference between the Koch brothers and us, you know?	0
The difference is if I succeed, if we succeed in electing an entire Congress which would be quite a success but a Senate and a President, you know, the tax policies that they would enact would probably cost us a lot more money quite honestly.	0
The Koch brothers would profit if they get their way and that's what, you know, there's no profit for us in this.	0
You know, understanding this: Koch brothers have said that they're gonna spend $900 million not on the presidency but on the down-ticket, on the senators and the congressman and the gubernatorial races and local races.	0
And so our job is to try and counter that in some way.	0
You actually have plenty of nice things to say about Bernie Sanders.	0
I think you did an interview with TheGuardian where you said you like the issues he was bringing up, you thought he was actually pushing Hillary Clinton in a certain way.	0
I am curious; why did you pick Clinton over Sanders?	0
Well, I've worked with Secretary Clinton as Secretary particularly when the Sudan and South Sudan were looking to vote for their own independence and it was an incredibly dangerous time for that country.	0
And there were, you know, hundreds of thousands of people's lives at risk.	0
And between the Secretary and the Security Council and some of the people on the ground and Kofi Anan and Jimmy Carter and people like that and thousands of people on the ground, we worked very hard to make sure that that didn't happen.	0
She understood it.	0
She understood the issues even though we don't have any great reason to pay much attention to Sudan.	0
We don't trade with them.	0
We don't get money from them.	0
I found her to know, to be knowledgeable and to be-- and to care about the issues.	0
And we've worked together since then and I've been a very big fan of hers.	0
But I want to say this: I really like Bernie.	0
I think what he's saying in this election is important if you're a Democrat.	0
Again to have these conversations, I hope he stays in for the entire election and if he were to win the nomination, I will do whatever I can including if asked a fundraiser like this again to try to give him or her, Hillary, I hope she wins a Senate because honestly we see what happens when a President tries to get their Supreme Court justice confirmed without the Senate.	0
You have minced no words about your feelings about Donald Trump.	0
"I think you called him a, ""xenophobic fascist."""	0
I hope I'm quoting you correctly.	0
I think you're pretty close.	0
Okay.	0
Fair enough.	0
What have your interactions been with him?	0
You ever have any personal interaction?	0
I met him once.	0
I've met him once.	0
I was sitting down at a table and he was nice.	0
And we talked a couple of times, I think.	0
And then he went on Larry King and told everybody I was very short.	0
"I wish I had said ""I met you sitting down."""	0
But, no.	0
It's not about that.	0
You know, here's the point about what's going on right now on the other side.	0
Trump and Cruz are making this a campaign of fear.	0
We have to be afraid of everything.	0
We have to be afraid of refugees.	0
We have to be afraid of Muslims.	0
We have to be afraid of minorities.	0
And the question is and this is an important one, are we really going to be scared of the very things that have made our country great?	0
"And if the answer is, ""Yes,"" then we have history to answer to because we're not afraid."	0
We are not a country that is afraid and I refuse to accept that.	0
Why do you think fear has been working at least in the Republican party?	0
Because fear's always worked one way or another.	0
In elections, fear has always been a great -- one of the great tools of any election.	0
But the reality is we are not the descendants of fearful people.	0
We're not.	0
So no, we're not going to ban Muslims from this country.	0
That's never going to happen.	0
And we're not going to go back to torture and we're not going to kill the families of terrorists or suspected terrorists because that is not who we are.	0
And if we did, our grandparents and their parents would be ashamed of us.	0
I'm curious; Hollywood and a lot of movie studios were very aggressive in putting pressure on the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that would have perhaps made it easier to discriminate gays and lesbians and transgender folks.	0
Some of that same pressure is being applied to North Carolina.	0
First of all do you approve of pressure like that, number one, and what do you make of the North Carolina law?	0
Well, I'm a protester from way back.	0
I got arrested in DC a couple years ago with my father protesting.	0
I'm a big believer in protests.	0
I think it matters from the '56 Montgomery bus protest to the apartheid protests that I was a part of when I was a young man.	0
But I find these to be really effective because these are big corporations that are protesting.	0
And when you have IBM and Walmart of all people and General Electric and people like that coming at you, it affects people.	0
And you can see it because we saw it with Mike Pence in Indiana.	0
We saw it with Jan Brewer in Arizona.	0
I think they can have some great effect and I think the law is ridiculous, of course.	0
All right.	0
George Clooney, I've kept you long enough.	0
Thanks for coming on.	0
Appreciate it.	0
Thank you, Chuck, I appreciate it.	0
You got it.	0
As you saw there, that was George Clooney, a Clinton supporter, striking an unusually conciliatory tone towards Bernie Sanders these days.	0
But Thursday night's debate between the candidates got pretty heated and it was not so conciliatory.	0
(BEGIN VIDEO)	0
You know, wait a minute, wait a minute, come on.	0
That's just not accurate.	0
Come on.	0
I have stood on the debate stage--	0
Wolf!	0
Wolf!	0
Can I--	0
--with Senator Sanders eight prior times.	0
I have said the exact same thing--	0
Wolf.	0
Wolf.	0
Excuse me, Wolf?	0
Secretary, Senator, please.	0
(END TAPE)	0
There you go.	0
The New York primary is on Tuesday.	0
Joining me now is the chair of the Democratic party, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, as well as our panel is going to be joining in here with the questioning.	0
But Madam Chairman, nice to see you.	0
Nice to see you, too.	0
Let me start with what George Clooney said.	0
He agreed this fundraiser, which benefits a big chunk of the DNC, obscene.	0
Do you agree with him?	0
Absolutely.	0
We agree as a party that there is an obscene amount of money in politics.	0
And that's why our members, I'm a co-sponsor, along with many of my colleagues of a constitutional amendment that would overturn Citizens United.	0
We need to make sure that we can keep elections that, like we did with changing congressional districting and redistricting across the country, that voters can choose their representatives and that we don't have outside undue influence come in and swoop in and, uh, make decisions on behalf of the majority of voters.	0
As I said, people see the panel is here.	0
Chris Matthews of Hardball, Kathleen Parker of The Washington Post, Perry Bacon of NBC News, Hugh Hewitt, the radio program Hugh Hewitt Show.	0
Chris, fire away.	0
Well, I think one thing Bernie Sanders is saying in his ads I don't think is true.	0
He's talking about members of Congress, people in Washington, taking money for speeches.	0
You're not allowed to do that.	0
You’re not allowed to do that.	0
You guys voted that out years ago.	0
That's right.	0
They're not allowed to do that.	0
There are no honorariums.	0
And, look, the bottom line here is that we have two candidates who are at the more narrow end of the funnel now as we end the primary election contest.	0
And it's going to get more heated.	0
But look, compared to the Republicans who are in utter chaos, our two candidates have been substantive and robust, they've kept largely to the issues that are important to the American people, talked about how they want to build on President Obama's congressional delegates, uh, congressional Democrats' legacy, and we want to move the country forward and help people reach the middle class.	0
And they have slightly different approaches to how to get there, but it's been a substantive discussion.	0
Yeah, slightly.	0
Okay.	0
Perry, go ahead.	0
Chairman, Bernie Sanders this week has really attacked the 1990s in some ways.	0
He says the crime bill of '94 and the welfare reform bill of 1996 were bad legislation.	0
Do you agree with that?	0
You know, I think that the impact of the crime bill has had some important effects and some detrimental effects.	0
And so, you know, both of our candidates voted for the crime bill.	0
And I think most Democrats would agree that there needs to be reforms so that we can make sure that sentencing and the way we manage our criminal justice system is a lot more equitable and fair than it is today.	0
Kathleen?	0
Yeah, going back to the financing of political campaigns, everybody loves to talk about how much we dislike Citizens United, you'll find people on both sides, Republicans dislike it too, at least a lot of them do.	0
Certainly, but that’s certainly not reflected in how they vote--	0
Well, Mitt Romney was one who spoke out about, you know, how much he disliked it because it gives so much power to people who are sort of marginal participants	0
While benefiting from it handsomely.	0
But that's not really my question.	0
I'm just laying that out as the prefatory note.	0
What I want to know is, is there ever any serious consideration given to a possibility of just limiting campaigns as other countries do, to two months, say?	0
And make them completely publicly funded.	0
Is that ever anything that gets serious consideration and would it be possible?	0
Only by Democrats.	0
I mean, certainly, Democrats have supported public financing of campaigns, I know I do, and many of my colleagues do.	0
And we do need to, you know, have an effort that both sides come together, and try to make that reform.	0
But Republicans have no interest in changing the campaign finance system.	0
They support the hundreds of millions of dollars of outside undue influence swooping in and weighing heavily on the outcome of any election contest.	0
It's obscene and we need to elect majorities in Congress so Democrats can make a difference in changing it.	0
Hugh, last question.	0
Chairwoman, let me bring up something that did not come up in the more cowbell debate from Thursday night.	0
And that is if after Lewandowski was charged, many Democrats and many Republicans said of Donald Trump's campaign manager that he should be fired, and he wasn't.	0
If any of Secretary Clinton's aides are indicted in the F.B.I.	0
server investigation, should they also be fired?	0
Should the same standard apply?	0
That is a question that I'm not even going near.	0
I don't think that's going to happen.	0
And at the end of the day, we are going to have a campaign that will play out.	0
Our nominee will ultimately be elected president of the United States because we are on the side of the American people, and ultimately our candidate--	0
It's not about whether or not it's going to happen, it's about the standard.	0
If a senior aide is ever indicted in a campaign, as Mr. Lewandowski was, should they be fired immediately?	0
Again, I don't think that that's going to happen.	0
So it's not a question that is one that I think makes sense to answer.	0
I'm focused on making sure that when we get to the end of our primary, we're preparing for the general election and we can and will elect our nominee, the 45th president of the United States.	0
I'm going to leave it there.	0
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Madam Chairwoman.	0
Thank you.	0
Thanks for coming in.	0
Thanks for having me.	0
And coming to the table.	0
Absolutely.	0
Any time.	0
And I appreciate it.	0
All right.	0
Thanks.	0
When we come back, the Republican race.	0
Donald Trump loses a delegate contest, and yet another state at a convention.	0
If he can't stop the bleeding, can he beat Ted Cruz at this summer's convention if he can't win on the first ballot?	0
If you want to know why Donald Trump is so frustrated with the delegate selection process, here's yet another example.	0
Yesterday in Wyoming, Ted Cruz, without a primary or a caucus, won all 14 delegates available at the state convention.	0
It means Cruz wound up with 23 pledged delegates from Wyoming with Trump and Marco Rubio each receiving just one.	0
So what happened in Wyoming has been typical of this campaign.	0
Though Trump is winning the overall battle for votes, and delegates say in primaries, he's losing the hand-to-hand combat over delegates that are awarded at state conventions.	0
And as a result, Trump has ricocheted between trashing the Republican National Committee and trying to make peace with it.	0
And it's clear now though that Donald Trump realizes the game is about winning on the first ballot at the convention, or he's doomed.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
The Republican National Committee, they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap.	0
The fight between the Republican frontrunner and the Republican party, smoldering for days, is turning to an all-out war.	0
The system, folks, is rigged.	0
It's a rigged system.	0
Because it's a rigged system, folks.	0
The Republican system is rigged, okay?	0
An on-again/off-again feud with party leaders is ratcheting up, even as Trump tries a campaign reboot.	0
After a crushing 13-point defeat in Wisconsin, Trump turned a page, sidelining campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.	0
He wasn't quite as effective for the past couple of months.	0
Hiring a new delegate wrangler, Paul Manafort, and a political director with close ties to the R.N.C.	0
Reaching out to members of Congress, and limiting exposure to the media to just friendly interviews.	0
When I take them out, I will be so presidentialyou won't believe it.	0
But even as Trump's new team attempts to keep him scripted--	0
Get him out.	0
Don't hurt him.	0
See how nice I am?	0
I'm saying don't hurt him.	0
--putting out a Wall Street Journal op-ed, promising to work closely with the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and top G.O.P.	0
officials to reform our election policy, Trump himself shows no sign of letting up.	0
The Republican National Committee, they better get going.	0
Because I'll tell you what, you're going to have a rough July at that convention.	0
But can Trump afford to alienate the party insiders he needs to unite the party and win a general election?	0
He's already struggling with swing voters.	0
Who's going to pay for the wall?	0
79% of Hispanic voters now view Trump unfavorably.	0
"No, I'll use the word ""anchor baby."""	0
Excuse me.	0
"I'll use the word ""anchor baby."""	0
So do 67 percent of suburban women, and 72 percent of moderates.	0
You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.	0
Your Twitter account--	0
Only Rosie O'Donnell.	0
Three years ago, after Mitt Romney's defeat, the party charted a path back to the White House that imagined a big-tent Republican party, and recommended new appeals to women and minority voters.	0
A welcoming attitude that we need to have in our party.	0
I think that we had some biologically stupid things that were said in the last election.	0
(END TAPE)	0
I'm joined now by the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.	0
Chairman Priebus, welcome back to Meet the Press.	0
Good morning.	0
Thank you.	0
Let me start with your Republican frontrunner continually calling the process that you're overseeing rigged.	0
How do you tell Republican voters you are running a fair process when the frontrunner is calling what you're doing rigged?	0
You know, look, I don't know what the motivation is.	0
There's really nothing that's rigged or being changed or altered.	0
These are the same rules that were in place basically for over a century.	0
But at the very least, there's no way around the fact that all of these states submitted their delegate allocation plans by October 1st of 2015.	0
And not a single thing has changed about it.	0
These conventions that people talk about, number one, it's not common.	0
But a few states out West use a convention system where delegates start competing at the county level a month ago, and they go through the county, the precinct, the congressional district in a state convention.	0
And the candidates participate the whole way through.	0
And no one was complaining, except for when it was all over.	0
And look, every state is different.	0
And you can reform the system.	0
I mean, look, this has been an ongoing debate.	0
But you have to go state by state by state.	0
It's a pretty extraordinary task.	0
"How concerned are you when Donald Trump says, ""The R.N.C."	0
"better be prepared for a rough July."""	0
And are you concerned about reports of threats being made to delegates?	0
What do you say to any campaign doing that?	0
Well, sure, I mean, look, there's no room for threatening the delegates or the convention or anybody that would be going to our national convention.	0
But I also think some of this is rhetoric and hyperbole.	0
And the truth is, is that the delegates themselves are the ones that write the rules for the convention.	0
The R.N.C.	0
doesn't write any rules.	0
The R.N.C.	0
has basically an administrative role at the convention.	0
It's by majority rule, the delegates can run the convention.	0
So it's on them to decide what they want to do about a lot of these issues, not us.	0
Who's picking this nominee?	0
The voters or the delegates?	0
You know, I think it's a combination, but it's empowered by the voters.	0
So the voters empower the delegates.	0
But ultimately, the delegates who, in most cases are bound by the outcome of caucuses and primaries and conventions, make the decisions at the conventions.	0
"Think about this, I think we lose sight of what the word ""convention"" means."	0
It's not a four-day party.	0
A convention, in its legal sense, is the members of the party coming together every four years to write the rules of the party, to elect officers of our party, and a nominee.	0
It has a legal value.	0
It's no different than when, like, you know, the boy scouts have a national convention.	0
They do similar things.	0
And that's what's happening.	0
But the media never covers the fact that we actually do a lot of business at the convention.	0
But now everyone's interested in this business of a national convention.	0
Yes, they are.	0
That's for sure.	0
Look, we just have a brand new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll out.	0
Among Republican voters, we asked this simple question who should be the winner.	0
Should it be the candidate with the most primary votes, regardless of whether it's a majority, or the candidate who is the choice of the delegates.	0
By two to one, Chairman Priebus, Republican voters say it's got to be the one who has the most primary votes.	0
And that's going to be Donald Trump by a lot.	0
What do you tell those voters if it's not Trump?	0
Well, look, if Donald Trump, if he was winning the majority of votes, he'd likely have the majority of delegates.	0
But that's not actually what's happening.	0
He's winning a plurality of votes, and he has a plurality of delegates.	0
And under the rules and under the concept of this country, a majority rules on everything.	0
Majority rules on the electoral college.	0
Majority rules at the D.N.C., at the R.N.C.	0
And I don't know too many places where majority doesn't rule.	0
And I would suppose that if people were asked a question like that, it makes sense, but it only tells you half the story.	0
Very quick chariman-- very quick, I've got a couple of campaigns that are worried you're going to allow Trump to bully you.	0
What do you say to that?	0
Bully you and cave to his demands.	0
No, listen, the rules are set.	0
I've been pretty clear.	0
I think I've done more TV in the last two weeks than I have in two years, and it's because I'm not going to allow anyone to rewrite the rules of our party.	0
All right.	0
Chairman Priebus, thanks for coming on Meet the Press this morning, good to see you.	0
You bet.	0
When we come back, check out this sign.	0
Welcome to North Carolina.	0
Due to our stance on LGBT rights, please set your clock back 100 years.	0
Obviously a protest sign, and that of course refers to the bill that North Carolina's governor Pat McCrory signed into law, that many critics say discriminates against the LGBT community.	0
Governor McCrory joins me next exclusively.	0
North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has found himself on the frontlines of the latest battle for LGBT rights.	0
Here’s what happened: the state’s largest city, Charlotte, passed an ordinance that prevented businesses from discriminating against lesbians, gays and transgender people.	0
In response, Governor McCrory quickly signed into law a bill that’s being called by some, anti-gay -- the so-called “bathroom law.”	0
The law does a few things.	0
First, it invalidates the Charlotte ordinance and prevents other municipalities in the state from passing similar protections.	0
Second, it requires that transgender people use the bathroom and locker room matching their birth-certificate gender, rather than the gender they identify with.	0
Governor McCrory has been forced to defend and clarify the law's intent, which goes much further than just repealing the Charlotte ordinance.	0
All while he faces a tough reelection fight this November, and the governor of North Carolina joins me now.	0
Governor McCrory, welcome to Meet the Press.	0
Thanks for having me.	0
I appreciate it.	0
Uh, since you signed the executive order, and it was intended to try, I think you were trying to ratchet back some of the controversy here, you still had more companies joining the boycott here, Bloomberg, Capital One, United Airlines, William Sonoma.	0
That's just on Friday.	0
160 companies have called for its repeal.	0
You still have an NBA commissioner that is not yet committing to keeping the All-Star game in Charlotte.	0
Any estimates we have of lost revenue so far, we have come up with calculated, conservative calculations, $39.7 million, $186 million perhaps in revenue, and some have suggested billions in lost revenue.	0
All of this now, do you have regrets signing this law?	0
I'm going to, as governor, as I did with mayor, I will always call out government overreach.	0
And this example, the city of Charlotte, where I was mayor for 14 years, did government overreach.	0
And what your pre-clip didn't mention was it was the left that brought about the bathroom bill, not the right in the city of Charlotte, like the city of Houston tried to do and was rejected by 61 percent of the vote.	0
The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private sector employer in Charlotte, North Carolina, one of the largest, 15th, 16th-largest cities in the United States of America.	0
And I think that's government overreach.	0
It's not government's business to tell the private sector what their bathroom, locker room, or shower -- um -- practices should be.	0
Not only the private business, but also the Y.M.C.A.	0
and other non-profit organizations.	0
And by the way, this is what 29 other states also do not have, these types of restroom, locker room, and bathroom policies.	0
So--	0
But I thought, you know, you talked about overreach.	0
Okay, you say Charlotte overreached.	0
Right.	0
How did the state of North Carolina, the state government, not overreach in just the same way.	0
You mentioned Houston.	0
Voters made that decision.	0
Right.	0
You can make a case, voters made the decision in Charlotte.	0
Charlotte rejected it, then elected two new members of the city council.	0
This has been a long debate in the city of Charlotte, this is where they came down.	0
You guys debated for, like, ten seconds.	0
I mean, don't you regret the time of debate?	0
Actually, Charlotte's vote was a very little debate.	0
They just had a lot of public speakers speaking for and against--	0
No, that night.	0
But this has been months -- this has been months of a debate.	0
Look, when Charlotte had originally turned it down, just like Houston has.	0
And there hasn't been outrage, there wasn't outrage towards Charlotte when they turned it down initially.	0
There was an outrage towards Houston, Texas, when they turned it down recently.	0
But I tell you what I have learned through this, is we've got to have more dialogue and not threats.	0
You know, I was in Hamlet, North Carolina, a small town that can be at any town in the United States of America.	0
"I walked into a buffet restaurant, African American buffet restaurant, and the people just welcomed me with open arms and said, ""Thanks for protecting us."""	0
"I got back in my car, and I got a call from someone in corporate America going, ""Man, you've got to change this."	0
"We're getting killed."""	0
And it showed me the disconnect we have between the corporate suites and main street on a very complex subject, and a very personal subject regarding government policy of all things, which didn't exist before this group brought this up.	0
It's a very thoughtful thing for you to say about dialogue.	0
Where was the dialogue in this?	0
I mean, first of all, you didn't--	0
Well, let me tell you.	0
Your legislature--	0
I didn't want to--	0
But legislature, to their defense--	0
What dialogue?	0
We had an April 1st deadline in which the Charlotte law was coming into effect.	0
And they had to pass the law prior to--	0
But you had said you weren't worried about that deadline.	0
I wasn't.	0
The legislature, according to their lawyers, were, because they were afraid once it became into effect, it would be harder to overturn.	0
And we can have the debate a longer time.	0
But again, I don't think government should be telling the private sector what their restroom and shower law should be, to allow a man into a woman's restroom, or a shower facility at a Y.M.C.A., for example.	0
However, in government, and I'm not going to tell the private sector any manufacturing plan, any bank can have their own policies.	0
NBC can have their own policy in Charlotte, North Carolina, or anywhere in North Carolina.	0
But I do believe in our high schools, in our middle schools, in our universities, we should continue to have the tradition that we've been having in this country for years.	0
And we have a women's facility and a men's facility.	0
You know, it's worked out pretty well.	0
And I don't think we need any further government interference.	0
But this, as we talked about, this law went further than that.	0
It wiped away the city of Charlotte's ability to govern, to do some things on their own.	0
For instance, they can't even have their own minimum wage now.	0
Why'd you do that?	0
Why'd you sign that?	0
You're a former mayor of Charlotte.	0
Could you accept all these limitations that big-state government has put on city and local control?	0
I made a point when I was mayor of Charlotte for 14 years, we dealt with fire and police and airports and roads and light rail lines, we didn't impose new regulations on businesses.	0
And I don't think the government ought to be the H.R.	0
director for every business, whether it be in Charlotte or whether it be in Greensboro or whether it be in Boone, North Carolina.	0
And this is that fine line between how much does government tell the private sector in a regulatory way what to do, and in this case, a city which I still proudly call home, I think overstepped.	0
And, you know, I've called out my own Republican legislature in the past, with magistrates and I've said no the magistrates need to marry after the Supreme Court case, and what the Supreme Court said.	0
I understand that.	0
But you didn't, you know, in your executive order, you didn't, and you're not calling for a passage of protecting gay North Carolinians from discrimination if they're fired in the private sector.	0
Why?	0
Because I'm not the private sector's H.R.	0
director.	0
I am the H.R.	0
director and the governor of all state employees.	0
And I signed an executive order which protects all state employees, in the ninth-largest state in United States of America, the same executive order that the Louisiana governor just signed, and got praised for it.	0
I just happen to be a Republican governor, and I got criticized for doing the same thing.	0
I have to say, there are a little bit of politics involved here.	0
But with all due respect--	0
Sure.	0
Barry Goldwater had said this when they were debating whether to have the Civil Rights act, and debating whether government should be involved in dealing with racial discrimination.	0
"And he said, ""I am unalterably opposed to discrimination of any sort."	0
"But not law that embodies features like these provisions which fly in the face of the constitution, and which require for their effective execution, the creation of a police state."""	0
The same argument was used to try to defeat laws that would -- are now considered untouchable, right?	0
Laws that protect minorities from discrimination in the private sector.	0
Why don't gays and lesbians qualify?	0
I don’t -- first of all, I don't know of any business right now in North Carolina, and very similar to what Nikki Haley said about South Carolina, that is doing this.	0
But at the same time, what we've got to do is deal with this extremely new social norm that has come to our nation at a very quick period of time, and have these discussions about the complexity of equality while also balancing the concept of privacy, including even privacy in the most private of areas of our life, which is a restroom, locker room, or shower facility in our high schools.	0
But gender identity is the same privacy.	0
It's the same issue --	0
Well, now, the folks that are-- if that’s the case --	0
It's dealing with that same privacy.	0
I mean, do you want somebody who identifies as a woman, born on their birth certificate as a man, may look like a woman, going into a men's bathroom?	0
All I'd say is we have 27 states--	0
Is that fair to them?	0
We have 27 states, not just -- this is not just a North Carolina debate.	0
This is a national debate that's just come on in literally the last three months.	0
No one had heard of this debate until the Houston ordinance was defeated by the people of Houston.	0
We have 27 to 29 states that also don't have this type of mandate on private business, including the state of New York.	0
I'm curious about due diligence.	0
Sure.	0
Did you meet with any transgender people?	0
I have.	0
Before you signed that law?	0
Not with -- but I’ve met with transgender people in the past, and I've met with them since, and have had very positive conversations.	0
Now the conversation with a very powerful group called the Human Relations, uh, Human Rights Council, my gosh, they're more powerful than the N.R.A., and they have millions of dollars, which makes me want to overturn United, ‘cause I don't know who their donors are either.	0
But they are putting on a lot of pressure, instead of having good dialogue.	0
And I had wonderful dialogue with a transgender woman who was, and we talked about each other's issues.	0
There's passion on each side of this issue.	0
All right, but does it bother you at all though, Georgia defeated it, South Carolina--	0
Wait a minute.	0
Does it bother you at all that basically North Carolina and Mississippi is the only other state to side with you on this.	0
Well, let me correct you.	0
Georgia and Mississippi was religious freedom bill.	0
This was not a religious freedom bill.	0
In fact, we have not had any religious freedom bill introduced in the state of North Carolina.	0
One reason is because I'm governor.	0
So the confusion by the national media and The New York Times of the Indiana religious freedom bill, Mississippi, and Georgia religious freedom bill, that's not the case.	0
This is basically a restroom privacy issue, versus equality.	0
And these things need to be discussed, not threatened by Hollywood or anyone.	0
You know, Hollywood, with all due respects to the Hollywood, the new Batman and Robin movie is playing in China, which has anti-gay, terrible, terrible human rights violations.	0
This is not like an issue of bathroom privacy or restroom privacy in North Carolina.	0
And let's have this dialogue and I welcome that dialogue.	0
All right, Governor McCrory, is there any way this gets repealed?	0
I don't think the restroom, I do believe that--	0
But you'll repeal other parts of this bill?	0
There is one part of the bill that I do disagree with, where I signed it, and that is you're not able to sue within state courts.	0
And that needs to be repealed.	0
It was very poorly thought out.	0
All right, we'll be watching for more.	0
Governor McCrory--	0
Thanks for bringing me here, appreciate it.	0
Appreciate it.	0
When we come back, we'll have much more on the 2016 race.	0
And then there was this, last night on S.N.L.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Once I'm elected president, I'll have a nice schvitz in the White House gym, then I'll go to the big banks, I'll sit them down and yada yada yada, they'll be broken up.	0
What?	0
"No, no, you can't ""yada yada"" at--"	0
(END TAPE)	0
When we come back the Republican party has 31 governorships, the most senators since 2005 and the most members of the House since the Hoover presidency.	0
So why does it seem the party has the death wish when it comes to trying to win the White House?	0
Panel is back, we’re going to discuss the Republican presidential race, we’ve got a lot going on in this show.	0
Hugh Hewitt, Reince Priebus is trying very hard to claim that the process is not rigged.	0
Donald Trump is trying very hard to paint it as rigged.	0
Who has got the better PR case?	0
RNC has the better facts as Reince Priebus pointed out in your interview.	0
They have instructed the committee this week not to make any rule changes.	0
Any rule changes will be done by the delegates themselves.	0
Look, Donald Trump does very well building skyscrapers ,not building state delegation majorities.	0
He got beat in Georgia last night, cue Vicki Lawrence the night the lights went out in Georgia, I think the Cruz campaign has won twelve consecutive victories over five states, including delegations.	0
I’ll put up a little graphic right now actually we put together.	0
He has beaten on delegates 2 to 1 since March 22nd.	0
He’s netted 66 but guess what, that advantage is erased on Tuesday with New York.	0
Trump is coming back because Ivanka has returned to the trail.	0
I think she is a tremendous, there is a piece in the New York Times this morning by Jonathan Moller, on how she is poised and disciplined and bringing that to her father’s campaign.	0
So the solution here is a fusion ticket Cruz Trump but Ivanka is the Vice President.	0
That’s insanity.	0
Let me tell you, Trump has got the same trump card that Bernie has-- democracy.	0
Ever since at least since the Kennedy-Humphrey fight over the nomination in Wisconsin and West Virginia.	0
Certainly through Reagan against Bush, certainly Obama against Hillary.	0
We watched the primaries to see who the nominee is and now we’re told don’t watch the primaries anymore, there’s this thing at the convention with the rules and you have to have a majority vote.	0
The numbers do show overwhelmingly, the Republican people believe in democracy and Trump makes that case.	0
Bernie makes it against the billionaires and Citizens United and it’s the same argument, the people should vote.	0
You know the problem Perry, is the political parties modeled their nominating process after the electoral college which, by the way, isn’t one person one vote either.	0
PERRY BACON JR.	0
But I think Trump has had a really good week in making this argument.	0
If you look at, we have these primaries for a reason and they’re not for fun.	0
The idea is that they matter to some extent.	0
I disagree with Chris a little bit in that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are winning the most delegates and the most states.	0
And I think that for most people that’s who the winner is and I think Reince has got to make a better argument than the rules are the rules are the rules.	0
How do you disagree with me?	0
PERRY BACON JR.	0
Because Chris, because Hillary Clinton not Bernie Sanders is the one winning the primary so I don’t think democracy is for…	0
No I said the rhetorical argument is for one man one vote.	0
They have the same rhetorical argument, yes.	0
For the record I agree with Chris on that because it is a good argument.	0
Look we care about people's’ votes right, oh no not really.	0
But I think Trump is actually going to have a very good week and, actually a couple of really good weeks, because he’s obviously going to take New York.	0
He’s predicted to get 85 to 90 of the 95 delegates and the leftovers are out in Staten Island and who knows.	0
But, you know, after that he goes out to Pennsylvania and Maryland and on and on and Indiana going in so he’s going to build some fresh momentum and I think that’s going to make a difference.	0
By the way guys we’ve got more of our NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, a little taste of it.	0
Maybe it doesn’t surprise people, but the two most popular presidential candidates by the American public overall are John Kasich and Bernie Sanders.,	0
Right.	0
Because they’re good people	0
The lowest negative rating among all Republican candidates is Kasich. Look at that.	0
Trump’s at 65 percent negative rating among all voters, Ted Cruz at 49 percent.	0
Hugh Hewitt, those are tough numbers man.	0
And by the way let me put up Hillary Clinton, 56 percent negative rating.	0
Again, Sanders-Kasich is what the people want apparently.	0
Parties are continuing bodies, they are not the public.	0
They stand for an ideological set of principles.	0
I was at the Republican Jewish committee in Nevada where Ted Cruz got four standing ovations from a decidedly not ideologically strong conservative.	0
I believe he’s going to be the nominee because he is more consistently with the ideological spectrum that is the continuing Republican party.	0
Donald Trump’s had a good week, Kathleen’s right he's going to have a good couple of weeks.	0
He ain’t getting close to 1237.	0
Wow.	0
He’s going to win.	0
Trump will be the nominee, probably for the opposite reason you say.	0
Why is every conservative radio guy basically for Cruz?	0
Explain the culture to me.	0
Actually, they’re not.	0
They’re all over the place--	0
It’s overwhelming--	0
The only guy who’s come out actually, formally, is Mark Levin.	0
Who has an enormous-- And I’m very neutral, I’m completely--	0
You are?	0
I’m Switzerland.	0
I don’t endorse anyone	0
No and he’s been-- You said if Trump’s the nominee you said you’d support him.	0
I said I’d support him.	0
All I hear is radio talk for Cruz.	0
You’ve gotta listen.	0
Only on Mark Levin is he strong that way.	0
But I will say, those in the local markets who are long-term ideological conservatives, like Charlie Sykes in Wisconsin, like Ted Cruz because of his policies.	0
I want to add, I thought after Wisconsin maybe Ted Cruz was starting to get more popular among moderate Republicans.	0
And the polls are showing Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, Ted Cruz is not broadening his coalition and that’s a problem.	0
He’s not really doing as well as he should.	0
Kathleen, very quickly, I think New York Values kneecapped him--	0
Totally.	0
And he couldn’t figure out a way out of it.	0
No, you can’t get out of it.	0
I mean, I think he’s eating alone in a fried chicken joint in the Bronx	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I think now the Cruz campaign wishes they said, hey, New York is yours Trump, we are going to camp out in Indiana and Pennsylvania.	0
Remember the guy who did that before, Gary Hart he’s eating L.A. with a gay group, and he’s sort of making fun of New Jersey aesthetically.	0
I’m sure glad I’m here and not New Jersey in some solid waste dump.	0
And guess what happened?	0
New Jersey's delegates went to Walter Mondale, and he was the nominee.	0
Right.	0
Quick programming note, we're going to take a quick break here.	0
A quick programming note, my colleague Lester Holt's going to be anchoring Nightly News live from the Middle East tomorrow, and with it, he'll have an exclusive interview with the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter.	0
Remember, there are serious issues that we are facing besides the way we argue about this election.	0
"And when we come back in 45 seconds, we'll have Endgame and the debate over the so-called ""bathroom law” in North Carolina."	0
Endgame time.	0
Panel is here.	0
Obviously I had Governor McCrory on earlier.	0
Kathleen Parker, you and he sparred via column.	0
You had a column that hit him pretty hard.	0
He did a letter to the editor hitting back at your column.	0
And we may not make up.	0
Good to hear.	0
What did you make of the governor’s response?	0
Well, besides the fact that Governor's from Ohio, he's certainly mastered the southern arts of sweet talk and finesse.	0
You know, the fact of the matter, as you pointed out, there is still in place this prohibition that local municipalities can have their own anti -- sorry -- discrimination laws.	0
Now he's backing off of that now, and I think calling it more or less it was hasty, poor writing, crafting of the bill.	0
And so that's good.	0
I give him credit for that.	0
"But still, you're allowing, the state is allowing private businesses, for example, to say, ""I'm sorry, but we don't serve gays here."""	0
"Or, ""We don't let gay people spend the night in our hotels."""	0
You know, there's no recourse for those people, because unless these municipalities can pass their own anti-discrimination laws, then, you know, they're out of luck.	0
But on the bathroom bill, this to me seems to be such a bogus issue all together.	0
I don't know what they're afraid of, you know?	0
"It's not as though you're going to have-- on the one hand, I'll hear from readers in North Carolina say, ""So in other words, you, Kathleen Parker, think that perverts, men, ought to be able to come into bathrooms and assault ten-year-old girls,"" right?"	0
So they're being fed some kind of crazy false narrative about what this is.	0
The crazy thing is, this is nanny state at its worst, if you think about it.	0
Where do they want the transsexuals to go?	0
If someone identifies, dresses, looks like a woman, that person shows up in a men's room at National Reagan Airport.	0
What happens then?	0
I mean, if you follow the law the governor signed, what goes on then?	0
You know, confusion and everything and probably a lot of disruption.	0
Hugh, you know, one thing that I'm going to point out here is that, I don't know if this is true or not, but this yet another Republican governor that I feel as if his legislature did something that maybe he didn't want to do, and he felt as if he had no choice but to sign the legislation.	0
Do you think that's at work here?	0
It's possible.	0
I mean, he did very well in his interview.	0
"He leaned into the problem, quoting Chris Matthew, ""Hang a lantern on your problem,"" showing up at Meet the Press on the Sunday after the controversy is very smart."	0
He'll probably be reelected.	0
But this is not the terrain the Republican party wants to fight this election on.	0
Going back to your Clooney interview, and by the way, I thought he was a better Batman than Ben Affleck at least, so--	0
The bathroom debate and batman debate here today, okay.	0
I want to argue about campaign financing.	0
Absolutely, Michael Keaton.	0
I want to point out that Charles Koch lives in Wichita, Kansas, in the same house that he has since 1974.	0
I want to argue that Tom Steiner is trying to buy.	0
I don't want to argue about bathroom bills.	0
I want to argue about ISIS and Libya going downhill.	0
This is not our terrain.	0
We should not fight.	0
You know I heard somebody say to me, Perry Bacon?	0
This is what happens because Republicans overdid it on redistricting.	0
And so yes, these folks are listening to their constituents, but only their constituents.	0
Almost a narrow band of them.	0
That’s right.	0
I'm not sure in this case that’s even true.	0
"As you pointed out though Georgia, South Carolina, Nikki Haley said, ""We're not doing that law here."""	0
She was very explicit about that.	0
I just think the Governor of North Carolina, the legislature missed the boat here.	0
"He used the phrase ""changing social norms."""	0
He's right.	0
People who are transgender are more accepted today.	0
Last year was a big year for gay rights.	0
"I just think he might have, you know, you asked him, ""Have you talked to anyone who was transgender before this bill passed?"""	0
"And he all but said, ""No."""	0
I just think he made a political mistake here without sort of thinking through the contours of the issue.	0
Any time you have to send an executive order to a bill you signed three weeks before, you probably didn't think about it through the first time very carefully.	0
Alright.	0
Let's lighten things up a little bit, besides our Batman debate.	0
Before we go, last night's S.N.L.	0
was a real treat for Seinfeld fans, which by the way now we're getting two decades old.	0
With Larry David as Bernie Sanders encountering Julia Louis Dreyfus's Elaine.	0
Take a look.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Once I'm elected president, I'll have a nice schvitz in the White House gym, then I'll go to the big banks, I'll sit them down and yada yada yada, they'll be broken up.	0
What?	0
"No, no, you can't ""yada yada"" at a debate."	0
"Also, you ""yada yada'd"" over the best part."	0
No, I mentioned the schvitz.	0
(END TAPE)	0
That's all we have today.	0
I'm going to go have some lobster bisque.	0
We'll be back next week.	0
Because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.	0
Hey, Michael.	0
Hey Mr. President, Thank you for taking the time.	0
Absolutely.	0
How have you been, OK?	0
Yeah, it has been a wild couple months.	0
You keep us busy.	0
Yeah, it's been good though.	0
It's been good. Do you want me to give you a quick overview	0
[of the story]	0
?	0
Yeah, it's a cool story.	0
I mean it's, the concept is right.	0
I predicted a lot of things, Michael.	0
Some things that came to you a little bit later.	0
But, you know, we just rolled out a list.	0
Sweden.	0
I make the statement, everyone goes crazy .	0
The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems. Huma	1
[Abedin]	1
and Anthony	1
[Weiner]	1
, you know, what I tweeted about that whole deal, and then it turned out he had it, all of Hillary's email on his thing .	1
NATO, obsolete , because it doesn't cover terrorism.	1
They fixed that, and I said that the allies must pay.	1
Nobody knew that they weren't paying.	0
I did.	0
I figured it.	0
Brexit, I was totally right about that .	0
You were over there I think, when I predicted that, right, the day before.	0
Brussels, I said, Brussels is not Brussels.	0
I mean many other things, the election's rigged against Bernie Sanders.	0
We have a lot of things.	0
But there's other things you said that haven't panned out. The peg for this story is the wiretapping hearing on Monday, in which	0
[FBI Director James]	0
Comey and	0
[NSA Director Mike]	0
Rogers testified about your tweets there.	0
Yeah well if you'd look at, in fact I'll give you the front page story, and just today I heard, just a little while ago, that Devin Nunes had a news conference , did you hear about this, where they have a lot of information on tapping.	0
Did you hear about that?	0
I have not, no.	0
Now remember this.	0
When I said wiretapping, it was in quotes.	0
Because a wiretapping is, you know today it is different than wire tapping.	0
It is just a good description.	0
But wiretapping was in quotes.	0
What I'm talking about is surveillance. And today,	0
[House Intelligence Committee Chairman]	0
Devin Nunes just had a news conference.	0
Now probably got obliterated by what's happened in London .	0
But just had a news conference, and here it is one of those things.	0
The other one, election, I said we are going to win, we won.	0
And many other things.	0
And I think this is going to be very interesting.	0
So you don't feel like Comey's testimony in any way takes away from the credibility of the tweets you put out, even with the quotes?	0
No, I have, look.	0
I have articles saying it happened.	0
But you have to take a look at what they, they just went out at a news conference.	0
Devin Nunes had a news conference.	0
I mean I don't know, I was unable to see it, because I am at meetings, but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance.	0
Now again, it is in quotes.	0
That means surveillance and various other things.	0
And the New York Times had a front-page story, which they actually reduced, they took it, they took it the word wiretapping out of the title, but its first story in the front page of the paper was wiretapping.	0
And a lot of information has just been learned, and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time.	0
We will see what happens.	0
Look.	0
I predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of Time.	0
"Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times , ""Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides."""	1
That's a headline.	0
Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning.	0
They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap.	0
Wiretapped data used in inquiry.	0
Then changed after that, they probably didn't like it.	0
And they changed the title.	0
They took the wiretap word out.	0
One of my ideas here is that throughout the campaign and now as president, you have used disputed statements, this is one of them that is disputed, the claim that three million undocumented people voted in the election...	1
Well I think I will be proved right about that too.	0
The claim that Muslims celebrated on 9-11 in New Jersey...	1
Well if you look at the reporter, he wrote the story in the Washington Post .	0
But my idea is that whatever the reality of what you are describing, the fact that they are disputed makes them a more effective message, that you are able to spread the message further, that more people get excited about it, that it gets on TV.	0
Well now if you take a look at the votes, when I say that, I mean mostly they register wrong, in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, and/or illegally.	0
And they then vote.	0
You have tremendous numbers of people.	0
In fact I'm forming a committee on it.	0
But there's no evidence that 3 million people voted with...	0
We'll see after the committee.	0
I have people say it was more than that.	0
We will see after we have.	0
But there will be, we are forming a committee.	0
And we are going to do a study on it, a very serious problem.	0
Is there anything different about making these kinds of predictions without having the factual evidence as President?	0
I'm a very instinctual person, but my instinct turns out to be right.	0
When everyone said I wasn't going to win the election, I said well I think I would.	0
You know it is interesting, somebody came up to me and said the other day, gee whiz, the New York Times and other people, you know other groups, had you down at one percent, well, I said no I think I am going to win, and people smiled, George Stephanopoulos laughed , you remember.	0
He thought it was very cute, and very funny.	0
Other people smiled.	0
And some people, the smart people or the people that know me didn't laugh at all.	0
There are people that know me, like Carl Icahn and many others, that didn't laugh at all, they thought I was going to win, because they understand how I, they understand me.	0
They get it.	0
But you take a look and guess what, I won, and I won easily.	0
I predicted Brexit.	0
Remember they said there was no way to get to 270?	0
Well I ended up at 306.	0
I had election night, 306.	0
But there was no way to get to, in fact I went to Maine four times, four times I went to Maine, because I had to get one vote, because there was no way to get to 270, but I ended up getting to 306.	0
Brexit, I predicted Brexit, you remember that, the day before the event.	0
I said, no, Brexit is going to happen, and everybody laughed, and Brexit happened.	0
Many many things.	0
They turn out to be right.	0
And now today, Devin Nunes, just had a news conference.	0
I'll look that up.	0
Yeah, just had it.	0
Now the problem, the thing is, I'm not sure they are watching anything other than that, let's see members of Donald Trump transition team, possibly, oh this just came out.	0
This is a Politico story .	0
Members of the Donald Trump Transition team possibly including Trump himself were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November's election.	0
House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes told reporters, wow.	0
Nunes said, so that means I'm right, Nunes said the surveillance appears to have been ... incidental collection, that does not appear to have been related to concerns over Russia.	0
But so incidental collection would not be wiretapping of you, it would be wiretapping of...	0
Who knows what it is?	0
You know, why, because somebody says incidental.	0
Nunes is going to the White House.	0
Nunes has also said that he has no evidence that your tweet was right, previously.	0
Well, he just got this information.	0
This was new information.	0
That was just got.	0
Members, of, let's see, were under surveillance during the Obama Administration following November's election.	0
Wow.	0
This just came out.	0
So, ah, just came out.	0
Mitch McConnell has said he'd rather you stop tweeting , that he sees it as a distraction.	0
Mitch will speak for himself.	0
Mitch is a wonderful man.	0
Mitch should speak for himself.	0
But you don't see any problems caused by these kinds of controversies.	0
Does this, when we are talking in the press about whether the president was wiretapped or not, is this good for you or bad for you?	0
Probably neither.	0
Probably neither.	0
What I said, look I said, Donna Brazile had information , and she had information on Hillary's debate questions.	0
I said why didn't Hillary apologize.	0
Donna Brazile just admitted that that was right.	0
I said the election was rigged against Bernie, a lot of people agree with that one, a lot of people hated the statement when I made it.	0
But I grant you some of those.	0
But you would agree also that some of the things you have said haven't been true.	0
You say that Ted Cruz's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald .	0
Well that was in a newspaper.	0
No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he's a friend of mine.	0
But that was in the newspaper.	0
I wasn't, I didn't say that.	0
I was referring to a newspaper.	0
A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast.	1
That gets close to the heart...	0
Why do you say that I have to apologize?	0
I'm just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano, I quoted Judge Napolitano , just like I quoted Bret Baier, I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap.	0
Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know.	0
But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term.	0
I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right.	0
I don't know where he has gone with it since then.	0
But I'm quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks.	0
But traditionally people in your position in the Oval Office have not said things unless they can verify they are true.	0
Well, I'm not, well, I think, I'm not saying, I'm quoting, Michael, I'm quoting highly respected people and sources from major television networks.	0
Did you see the Wall Street Journal opinion page today , the editorial page?	0
I thought it was, I thought it was a disgrace that they could write that.	0
But let me just, the hypothetical they started with, you have to announce to the country or to the world that some serious national security event has happened, and...	0
The country believes me.	0
Hey.	0
I went to Kentucky two nights ago , we had 25,000 people in a massive basketball arena.	0
There wasn't a seat, they had to send away people.	0
I went to Tennessee four nights ago.	0
We had a packed house, they had to send away thousands of people.	0
You saw that, right.	0
Did you see that?	0
Yes I did.	0
The country's not buying it, it is fake media.	0
And the Wall Street Journal is a part of it.	0
Ok.	0
So you don't worry that your credibility, that if you've cited things that later turn out to be wrong, based on anonymous sources that that hurts you.	0
Name what's wrong!	0
I mean, honestly.	0
Fox News said...	0
Brexit.	0
Wait a minute.	0
I predicted Brexit.	0
What I said about NATO was true, people aren't paying their bills.	0
And everyone said it was a horrible thing to say.	0
And then they found out.	0
And when Germany was over here I said, we are going to have a great relationship with Germany but you have to pay your NATO bills, and they don't even dispute it, ok.	1
So what have I said that is wrong?	0
Everyone, I got attacked on NATO and now they are all saying I was right.	0
I got attacked on Brexit, when I was saying, I said long before the day before, I said the day before the opening, but I was saying Brexit was going to pass, and everybody was laughing, and I turned out to be right on that.	0
I took a lot of heat when I said Brexit was going to pass.	0
Don't forget, Obama said that U.K. will go to the back of the line, and I talked about Sweden, and may have been somewhat different, but the following day, two days later, they had a massive riot in Sweden, exactly what I was talking about, I was right about that.	0
But even in that Sweden quote, you said look at what happened on Friday in Sweden.	0
But you are now saying you were referring to something that happened the following day.	0
No I am saying I was right.	0
I am talking about Sweden.	0
I'm talking about what Sweden has done to themselves is very sad, that is what I am talking about.	0
That is what I am talking about.	0
You can phrase it any way you want.	0
A day later they had a horrible, horrible riot in Sweden and you saw what happened.	0
I talked about Brussels.	0
I was on the front page of the New York Times for my quote.	0
I said Brussels is not what it used to be, very sad what has happened to Brussels.	0
I was absolutely lambasted.	0
A short Time later they had the major attack in Brussels.	0
One year ago today.	0
Exactly one year ago today.	0
And then people said you know Trump was right.	0
What am I going to tell you?	0
I tend to be right.	0
I'm an instinctual person, I happen to be a person that knows how life works.	0
I said I was going to win the election, I won the election, in fact I was number one the entire route, in the primaries, from the day I announced, I was number one.	0
And the New York Times and CNN and all of them, they did these polls, which were extremely bad and they turned out to be totally wrong, and my polls showed I was going to win.	0
We thought we were going to win the night of the election.	0
So when you...	0
And then Time magazine, which treats me horribly, but obviously I sell, I assume this is going to be a cover too, have I set the record?	0
I guess, right?	0
Covers, nobody's had more covers.	0
I think Richard Nixon still has you beat .	0
But he was in office for longer, so give yourself time.	0
Ok good.	0
I'm sure I'll win.	0
If you go back to Comey testifying that he and the Justice Department have no information to back up your tweet, the head of the NSA testifying that there is no information to back up your tweet, or the claim made by Judge Napolitano...	0
On front page of the New York Times , OK?	0
It's in the title of the front page. And I would like you to officially I know you are going to write a bad article because you always do	0
[mention]	0
wiretap data used in inquiry of Trump aides.	0
OK. Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aids.	0
Ok?	0
Can you possibly put that down?	0
Front page, January 20th.	0
Now in their second editions, they took it all down under the internet.	0
They took that out.	0
Ok?	0
But that's the way it is.	0
And then they just had a news conference now where they turned out, you watch.	0
You watch.	0
That is different...	0
I'm not criticizing anybody, I'm just saying.	0
That is different that the president wiretapping you which would be a crime outside of a court.	0
Well I don't know where these wiretaps came from.	0
They came from someplace.	0
That is what they should find out.	0
And you know the real story here is about the leakers.	0
OK?	0
You don't write about that.	0
But the real story here is, who released General Flynn's name?	0
Who released, who released my conversations with Australia, and who released my conversation with Mexico?	0
To me, Michael, that's the story, these leakers, they are disgusting.	0
These are horrible people.	0
And apparently there is an investigation into that as well.	0
Well should be, because that's where the whole, who would think that you are speaking to the head of Mexico, the head of Australia, or General Flynn, who was, they are not supposed to release that.	0
That is the most confidential stuff.	0
Classified.	0
That's classified.	0
You go to prison when you release stuff like that.	0
And who would release that?	0
The real story is, they have to work, intelligence has to work on finding out who are the leakers.	0
Because you know what?	0
When things get involved with North Korea and all the problems we have there, in the Middle East, I mean, that information cannot be leaked out, and it will be by this, this same, and these people were here in the Obama years, because he had plenty of leakers also.	0
But intelligence has to find out, who are these people.	0
Because the biggest story here is, who is leaking this classified information.	0
But isn't there, it strikes me there is still an issue of credibility.	0
If the intelligence community came out and said, we have determined that so and so is the leaker here, but you are saying to me now, that you don't believe the intelligence community when they say your tweet was wrong.	0
I'm not saying no, I'm not blaming.	0
First of all, I put Mike Pompeo in.	0
I put Senator Dan Coats in.	0
These are great people.	0
I think they are great people and they are going to, I have a lot of confidence in them.	0
So hopefully things will straighten out.	0
But I inherited a mess, I inherited a mess in so many ways.	0
I inherited a mess in the Middle East, and a mess with North Korea, I inherited a mess with jobs, despite the statistics, you know, my statistics are even better, but they are not the real statistics because you have millions of people that can't get a job, ok. And I inherited a mess on trade.	1
I mean we have many, you can go up and down the ladder.	0
But that's the story.	0
Hey look, in the mean Time, I guess, I can't be doing so badly, because I'm president, and you're not.	0
You know.	0
Say hello to everybody OK?	0
Thank you very much, Mr. President.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
I am thrilled to be back in the very, very beautiful state of West Virginia.	0
And I am proud to stand before you and celebrate the hard working people who are the absolute backbone of America.	0
Thank you.	0
I love the people of the states.	0
I love your grit, your spirit, and I love our coal miners.	0
They are coming back strong.	0
[Applause]	0
I made you a promise during the campaign.	0
You all remember.	0
Many of you were here.	0
I actually think we have more people here tonight with thousands outside than we had during the campaign, if you can believe it.	0
[Applause]	0
And as you've seen, I've kept that promise.	0
As President, we are putting our coal miners back to work.	0
We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.	0
We've stopped the EPA intrusion.	0
American coal exports are already up.	0
Think of this.	0
Think of this.	0
American exports of coal are already up more than 60% this year.	0
Did you ever hear of anything like that?	0
What you voted for is happening every single day.	0
Everyone in the arena is united by shared values.	0
[Applause]	0
We believe in God, we believe this team, we believe in country.	0
We support the Constitution of the United States of America.	0
We cherish and defend the second amendment.	0
We believe school should teach students to love our country, to have pride in our history, and to respect our great American flag.	0
We stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement.	0
Thank you.	0
We believe strongly that a nation must defend and protect its borders.	0
And above all else, we believe we must take care of our own citizens, and put America first.	0
Day after day, we are keeping the promises that we made during the campaign.	0
That includes our promises to our great veterans.	0
Thank you, veteran... veterans.	0
Today we announce new telehealth services to help the veterans get the care when and where they need it.	0
It is so popular.	0
This state has many retired military members.	0
We thank them.	0
We thank their family and spouses for their patriotic service.	0
They have been incredible.	0
We in America honor our great heros.	0
This week in the East Room of the White House, I awarded the Medal of Honor to a true American hero.	0
Specialist 5, James C. McCloughan.	0
Many of you watched as I gave Jim the medal.	0
He courageously saved the lives of his fellow soldiers in Vietnam.	0
His story is now enshrined forever.	0
Earlier this morning the former Marine named Woody Williams lead everyone here in the Pledge of Allegiance.	0
Thank you, Woody.	0
[Applause, Crowd chants USA]	0
Woody received a Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman for his actions in Iwo Jima.	0
We honor you and salute you and thank you for what you've done for all of us.	0
Thank you, Woody.	0
We must protect them with their put, sweat, tears, and bravery.	0
All across the country Americans of every kind are coming together with one simple goal.	0
Make America great again.	0
The stock market reached yet another all time in history.	0
All time high today.	0
Boosting at the retirement savings, hope any, of everybody in the room.	0
Have you all been helped?	0
I think so.	0
Unemployment is at a 16-year low don't forget.	0
I'll never forget the millions and millions of people out there that want jobs that don't register on the unemployment rolls, because they gave up looking for jobs.	0
So I accept the number, but honestly, we all know there are millions of people out there that we love.	0
The forgotten men and women and they are looking for jobs.	0
They are going to have them.	0
I have factories coming back into the country.	0
You've seen that.	0
They are coming back.	0
[Cheers]	0
We have auto plants expanding and coming back they are coming into Michigan. They are really coming into Michigan. And they are coming into Ohio and Pennsylvania. Economic growth has surged to 2.6% nationwide. You have to understand what that means. Nobody thought that number was going to happen. And at 3% growth in West Virginia. I wonder how that happened. 3% growth. West Virginia, you are leading the average. When was the last time you heard that, West Virginia? You are leading the country's average. Remember I told you don't sell your homes. Don't sell your homes. You are doing great. I'm so proud of you. You know, we won the state by 42 points. Can you believe that? 42 points. I asked your Republican party leader how would we be doing today versus November 8th and Election Day. He said honestly, President Trump, you are doing better. I said better? 42 points since our election, not mine, since our election we've added more than one million new jobs. And the good news keeping on pouring in. In fact, we have a very important announcement to make tonight. Does anybody know what that announcement is? Does anybody know what that announcement is? We have a very, very large announcement. Do you understand? Large. So I would like to invite my good friend and your Governor, Jim Justice, up to the stage to share this news with all of you. Jim, come on up. Come on up, Jim. Look at this guy. Jim is going to say a few words. These words have not been spoken by a major political figure, meaning Governor or Senator in our country for a long time. Thank you. First of all, it is a real honor. Thank you for coming. Thank our great President for being here. I've got to tell you a couple of stories real quick. I've been to the Oval Office twice in the last few weeks. I've been to present an idea on coal and manufacturing. I've had the great opportunity to be with our President. Let me tell you just this. I have to be serious with you just a moment. I have to tell you at the last session of our legislature I tried with all of my soul. Now I can tell you if you'll just give me just a moment. This man and myself are are not politicians. We ran to get something done. We ran and gave up part of our lives. We ran, because we want nothing. We ran as our founding fathers did years and years ago to serve now I will promise you until my soul that no one loves West Virginia more than I. In the last session, I would tell you that there was something greatness to passed with our rows and so on. But there was way too much pain. Now listen to me and listen really good. We hurt a lot of people. We hurt our vets and our teachers and our disabled and our weak and we walked away from at the old. Now I can promise you just this, I came -- I came to only get something done. Let me just say this to you as bluntly as I can say it. West Virginia, at the altar when we had it done, like it or not like it, but the Democrats walked away from me. Now today I would tell you with los of prayers and lots of thinking, today I'll tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you being a Democrat Governor. So tomorrow I will be changing my registration to Republican. Applause, Cheers]	0
As a coach, I would tell you it is time to run another play.	0
I would also tell you this, please pay close attention to this.	0
My mom and dad were staunch lovers of Ronald Reagan.	0
Staunch Republicans.	0
My mom and dad are no question in my mind in heaven right now and their both saying the same thing.	0
But my mom is saying it more profoundly.	0
That is she's saying, Jimmy, it's about damn time you came to your senses.	0
Now let let me go one step further and say just this.	0
What in the world is wrong us as people?	0
Have we not heard enough about the Russians?	0
I mean to our God in heaven above.	0
The stock market is in 22,000.	0
And this country has hope.	0
We're on our way.	0
This man is the really dear friend of mine.	0
But you know what else is unbelievable?	0
This man now has a Chief of Staff that all of us can pronounce his first name.	0
And you know what that name is today?	0
"It is ""Sir""."	0
Think about that.	0
Now I'll end by saying we're a long ways from being perfect.	0
There's mistakes made and change is tough.	0
I can tell you this tough.	0
I can tell you this: This man is a reflection of his kids.	0
Eric Trump has been in the back of the woods changing a tire, I've talked with Donald Junior, and Ivanka and Jared, -- even though Jared is our great son-in-law, are so good at being in charge.	0
Now I'll end by saying very quickly this man is a good man.	0
He's got -- he's got a backbone, he's got real ideas.	0
We cares about America, he cares about us in West Virginia.	0
And most importantly of all, you know what?	0
He has made us as common, every everyday Americans, feel good and be proud of who we are.	0
My friend, our great President, Donald J. Trump.	0
[Applause]	0
I want to thank your great Governor.	0
Having big Jim as a Republican is such an honor.	0
I will tell you.	0
Such an honor.	0
It is a fantastic man.	0
A fantastic guy.	0
And thank you, Jim, very much all over the nation.	0
They are watching.	0
They really appreciate that.	0
And we have another friend with us tonight who voted for us on health care and honestly, how the Republicans and the Democrats let us down on that is hard to believe.	0
Repeal and replace.	0
Hard to believe.	0
Hard to believe.	0
Senators.	0
A Senator who voted for us, Shelley Moore, who is here with us tonight.	0
Thank you, Shelley.	0
Jim came to the Oval Office a couple of weeks ago.	0
We talked about how we are working together to open up the coal mines in this state and also very importantly to create jobs in furniture manufacturing, and other forms of manufacturing very important to Jim.	0
But Governor Justice did something else very important tonight.	0
He showed the country that our agenda rises above left or right it is an agenda for all of the people, especially for the tens of millions of forgotten Americans.	0
They are not so forgotten anymore.	0
I will tell you.	0
He approved that.	0
You proved it.	0
They are not forgotten anymore.	0
Countless citizens, Democrats, and Republicans, independents, have been neglected and ignored by Washington.	0
But we will make sure they are never ignored again.	0
We know there are powerful forces in Washington who want to stomp us.	0
But we won't let them.	0
We are fighting for every American who has been overlooked, pushed aside, or told to put their dreams on hold but we will win and we're winning though.	0
The failed voices in Washington who oppose our movement are the exact same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another.	0
Who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another, and who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs.	0
They gave them away.	0
We don't need advice from the Washington swamp.	0
We need to drain the swamp.	0
[Applause]	0
Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.	0
You know it better than most.	0
I didn't come to Washington for me.	0
I came to Washington for all of you.	0
That I can tell you.	0
[Applause]	0
Your dreams are my dreams.	0
Your hopes are my hopes.	0
And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day.	0
The question for Democrats -- all Democrats, including those in Congress, is whether they are on the side of the voters or are they on the side of the special interests?	0
The reason why Democrats only talk about at the totally made up Russia story is because they have no message, no agenda, and no vision.	0
They don't talk about the all time high stock market.	0
They don't talk about reforms to the V.A.	0
Or about manufacturing jobs we're bringing back to America by the hundreds of thousands.	0
They don't talk about the Keystone pipeline that I immediately approved or the Dakota Access Pipeline.	0
Russia story is a total fabrication.	0
It is just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics.	0
That's all it is.	0
It is just makes them feel better what they have nothing else to talk about.	0
What the prosecutor should be look at are Hillary Clinton's 33,000 deleted e-mails, and they should be looking at the paid Russian speeches.	0
And the owned Russian companies.	0
Or let them look at at the uranium she sold that's now in the hands of very angry Russian.	1
Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign.	0
There never were.	0
We didn't win because of Russia.	0
We won because of you.	0
That I can tell you.	0
We won because we totally out worked the other side.	0
We won because millions of patriotic Americans voted to take back their country.	0
Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania?	0
Are there any Russians here tonight?	0
Any Russians?	0
They can't beat us at the voting booths.	0
They are trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.	0
They are trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us and most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.	0
I just hope the final determination is a truly honest one.	0
Which is what at the the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve.	0
And what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve Democrat lawmakers will have to decide.	0
They can continue their obsession with the Russian hoax, or they can serve the interests of the American people.	0
Try winning a the voter booth.	0
Try winning at the voter booth.	0
Not going to be easy.	0
But that's the way you are supposed to do it.	0
Our agenda is the pro-growth agenda.	0
We want to control our boarders and lift our people from welfare to work.	0
We want to support our police and make our communities safe.	0
We want to reduce taxes and increase wages for all of our people.	0
We want to get the special interest out of politics for good.	0
And we want to bring back our plants and our factories and our manufacturing and that's what is happening right now.	0
You see it, and so does every other state in our union.	0
That is why in the proud tradition of America's great leaders from Washington to Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt, we are protecting American workers and we are protecting American industry for the first time in many, many decades.	0
No longer will we allow other considerations to close our jobs, steal our factories, and drain our wealth.	0
We are building our future with American labor and hands and aluminum and steel and, what else, coal.	0
We will buy American and we will hire American.	0
To protect our jobs and our industry, I withdrew the United States from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
And to protect our workers and coal miners, I also withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.	0
But not only are we bringing back our jobs, we are bringing back our safety.	0
We have seen the bloodshed and devastation inflicted by terrorists in America, in Europe, and all across the world I said it during the campaign.	0
I will say it again right here tonight.	0
We will keep radical, Islamic terrorists out of our country.	0
[Applause, Crowd chants USA]	0
we only want to admit people in our country who love our people and who share our values.	0
We're also keeping our country safe from criminal gangs and violent crime.	0
We are taking the fight to the drug smugglers.	0
Human traffickers.	0
And the vile criminal cartels like MS-13 who are being thrown out of our country so quickly you can't even count.	0
Just last week I visited Long Island.	0
MS-13 has brought violence to a once-peaceful and beautiful neighborhood right where I grew up.	0
We are liberating American communities from the vicious, violent gangs.	0
One by one we're finding the drug dealers, gang members, thieves, criminals, and predators, and we're throwing them out of our country.	0
Once they are gone, we will not let them back in.	0
We are stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.	0
You have a big problem in West Virginia and we are going to solve that problem.	0
We are cracking down strongly on sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens.	0
And in order to stop the drugs, gangs, and traffickers, we are building a wall on the southern border.	0
I also proudly announced legislation this week with Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue to perform our immigration system to protect American workers and American taxpayers.	0
It is called the raise act.	0
R-A-I-S-E.	0
The Raise Act.	0
For many years America has issued most of the green cards to lower-skilled immigrants.	0
And people who had no hope of getting a job.	0
Undermining blue collar workers and wages and costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars a year.	0
The Raise Act switches to a merit-based system.	0
You come in largely based on merit.	0
Doesn't that sound nice?	0
Wouldn't that be nice?	0
It is about time.	0
Our proposal prevents new immigrants from going on welfare for at least five years.	0
So you don't come in and go on welfare.	0
Our plan favors applicants who can speak English, who can support themselves financially, and who demonstrate valuable skills that will strengthen our economy and strengthen our country.	0
We believe decisions on who immigrants are in our country should be based on the best interest of America and the best interest of the American people.	0
You.	0
We are working to honor millions and million of workers who came out and voted for us.	0
That's why I will repeat again tonight that Congress must do its job, keep its promise, live up to its were, and repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
You have to do it.	0
Fog in life is easy.	0
But Congress must not give in.	0
They must not give up.	0
But instead, Congress must get to work and deliver Americans the great health care that they deserve, the great repeal and replace that they've been talking about for seven years.	0
Incredible.	0
One vote.	0
Incredible.	0
But we'll get it.	0
We'll get it, folks.	0
They can't give up.	0
Call your Congressman, call your Senators, call everybody.	0
Get them to have the guts to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
Which is a disaster.	0
To be a prosperous nation, it is critical we lower the tax burden on our workers and businesses.	0
The United States has the highest tax rate on business anywhere in the world.	0
We want to bring it down to one of the lowest, because we want more growth, more jobs, and high er pay.	0
That's what's doing to happen.	0
And importantly, we also want to let Americans keep more of their own money.	0
Not take it from them.	0
It is time to pass a tax cut for middle class families.	0
Finally, and you'll see very soon what you are hearing about it, my administration is committed to rebuilding the deleted infrastructure of the United States.	0
Think of it.	0
We've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East and the Middle East is a hundred times worse than it was 16 years ago when we started.	0
Can you believe this?	0
What a shame.	0
That's why we are pushing a $1 trillion new infrastructure investment bill.	0
We're going to fix our roads, we're going to fix our bridges, we're going to fix our highways and our schools and our airports we will create amazing monuments that inspire awe and wonder in our people.	0
It used to be that way.	0
It is not that way any longer.	0
We have airports that look like third world countries.	0
It is not going to be that way anymore.	0
American workers will build this great future.	0
And American energy and American clean coal will power this future.	0
We are the nation that put a man on the moon that dug out the Panama Canal, and that won two world wars.	0
We can do anything, we can build anything with and we can dream anything.	0
We share one home and one glorious destination.	0
Where we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood.	0
We all salute that same great American flag.	0
And we are all made by the same almighty God.	0
As long as we remember these truths and who we are and what we are fighting for, we will never fail.	0
America will triumph.	0
Freedom will prevail.	0
Our values will endure.	0
Our citizens will prosper.	0
And our nation will thrive as never before.	0
With patriotism in our soul and with love for West Virginia in our hearts, we say these words again tonight.	0
We will make America strong again.	0
We will make America wealthy again.	0
We will make America proud again we will make America safe again.	0
And we will make America great again.	0
Thank you, West Virginia.	0
God bless you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
What a crowd.	0
And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK. That I can tell you.	0
A lot of people in here, a lot of people pouring right now.	0
They can get them in.	0
Whatever you can do, fire marshals, we'll appreciate it.	0
And I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, for the introduction.	0
As well as my friend Dr. Ben Carson.	0
And thank you to a very, very special man, Franklin Graham, Reverend Franklin Graham, for leading us in prayer.	0
And thank you too Alveda King, the niece of the great Dr. Martin Luther King.	0
It really shows you that America is indeed a nation of faith, we know that.	0
Well, I'm thrilled to be back in Phoenix, in the great state of Arizona.	0
With so many thousands of hard-working American patriots.	0
You know I'd love it if the cameras could show this crowd, because it is rather incredible.	0
It is incredible.	0
It is incredible.	0
As everybody here remembers, this was the scene of my first rally speech, right?	0
The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight, that the people said right at the beginning, you know, there's something special happening here.	1
And we went to center stage almost from day one in the debates.	0
We love those debates.	0
But we went to center stage and we never left, right?	0
All of us, we did it together.	0
You were there at the start.	0
You've been there every single day since, and I will never forget.	0
Believe me, Arizona, I will never forget.	0
And I'm here tonight to send a message: We are fully and totally committed to fighting for our agenda, and we will not stop until the job is done.	0
This evening, joined together with friends, we reaffirm our shared customs, traditions and values.	0
We love our country.	0
We celebrate our troops.	0
We embrace our freedom.	0
We respect our flag.	0
We are proud of our history.	0
We cherish our Constitution, including, by the way, the Second Amendment.	0
[Crowd chants USA]	0
We fully protect religious liberty.	0
We believe in law and order.	0
And we support the incredible men and of law enforcement.	0
And we pledge our allegiance to one nation under God.	0
You always understood what Washington, D.C. did not.	0
Our movement is a movement built on love.	0
It's love for fellow citizens.	0
It's love for struggling Americans who've been left behind, and love for every American child who deserves a chance to have all of their dreams come true.	0
From the inner cities to the rural outposts, from the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt, from east to west and north to south, our movement is built on the conviction that every American from every background is entitled to a government that puts their needs first.	0
It is finally time to rebuild our country, to take care of our people, and to fight for the jobs our great American workers deserve, and that's what we're doing.	0
[Crowd chants USA]	0
After our amazing election victory, the forgotten men and women -- remember we used to talk about the forgotten men and women before the election?	0
Guess what?	0
They're not forgotten... anymore, right?	0
Anymore.	0
No, they're not forgotten anymore folks.	0
In fact, they're trying to figure you out.	0
They're saying the obstructionists, how do we get them to vote for us?	0
I don't think that's going to happen any time soon.	0
We believe that every American has the right to live with dignity.	0
Respect for America demands respect for all of its people.	0
Loyalty to our nation requires loyalty to each other, We all share the same home, the same dreams and the same hopes for a better future.	0
A wound inflicted upon one member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all.	0
You saw last night.	0
You saw last night.	0
Did anybody watch last night?	0
Yes.	0
When one part of America hurts, we all hurt.	0
And when one American suffers an injustice, all of America suffers together.	0
We're all together.	0
It's time for us to follow the example of our brave American soldiers.	0
And I was with a lot of them last night, Fort Myers.	0
No matter where they come from, no matter what faith they practice, they form a single unbreakable team.	0
That's what we are.	0
We're a team.	0
As a nation, we're a team.	0
They're all united by their devotion to our country and to their mission.	0
It's time for all of us to remember that we are all on the same team.	0
We are all Americans, and we all believe right now in America first.	0
And it's happening, and it's happening fast.	0
I see all those red hats and white hats.	0
It's all happening very fast.	0
"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""	0
You see what's going on.	0
It's coming back, very fast.	0
We want every child to succeed, every community to prosper and every struggling American to have a chance for a better life.	0
What happened in Charlottesville strikes at the core of America.	0
And tonight, this entire arena stands united in forceful condemnation of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and violence.	0
But the very dishonest media, those people right up there with all the cameras.	0
[Booing]	0
So the -- and I mean truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media, they make up stories.	0
They have no sources in many cases.	0
"They say ""a source says"" -- there is no such thing."	0
But they don't report the facts.	0
Just like they don't want to report that I spoke out forcefully against hatred, bigotry and violence and strongly condemned the neo-Nazis, the White Supremacists, and the KKK.	0
I openly called for unity, healing and love, and they know it because they were all there.	0
So what I did -- So what I did is I thought, I'd take just a second, and I'm really doing this more than anything else, because you know where my heart is, OK?	0
I'm really doing this to show you how damned dishonest these people are.	0
[Booing]	0
So here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville -- and I have a home in Charlottesville, a lot of people don't know.	0
Here's the first -- can't believe they haven't figured that one out yet.	0
Now they know.	0
Now they finally know.	0
But I -- I just -- I don't want to bore you with this, but I -- it shows you how dishonest they are.	0
And most of you know this anyway.	0
"So here's what I said, really fast, here's what I said on Saturday: ""We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia"" -- this is me speaking."	0
"We condemn in the strongest, possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence."""	0
That's me speaking on Saturday.	0
Right after the event.	0
"So I'm condemning the strongest, possible terms, ""egregious display,"" ""hatred, bigotry and violence."""	0
OK, I think I can't do much better, right?	0
OK.	0
But they didn't want to put this on.	0
They had it on initially, but then one day he talked -- he didn't say it fast enough.	0
He didn't do it on time.	0
Why did it take a day?	0
He must be a racist.	0
It took a day.	0
[Booing]	0
Dishonest people.	0
So here is -- here is me -- I hope they're showing how many people are in this room, but they won't.	0
They don't even do that.	0
The only time they show the crowds is when there's a disrupter or an anarchist in the room.	1
I call them anarchists.	0
Because, believe me, we have plenty of anarchists.	0
They don't want to talk about the anarchists.	0
"So this is me -- ""it has no place in America."""	0
I'm talking about hatred, bigotry and violence.	0
It has no place in America.	0
What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.	0
No citizen should ever fear for their safety, security in our society, and no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play or be with their parents and have a good time.	0
This is me speaking.	0
Here's further.	0
This is on Saturday, the first one.	0
I did this three times.	0
"We have to come together as Americans with love for the nation and true affection, really -- and I say this so strongly -- ""true affection for each other."""	0
I didn't say true affection for you and you.	0
I said for each other, all of us.	0
All of us.	0
All of us.	0
But they don't report it.	0
They don't -- they just let it go.	0
Above all else, we must remember this truth, no matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first.	0
We love our country, we love our God, and we love our flag.	0
[Crowd chants USA]	0
And then I went on, this is my first statement, and they said, remember they said, well, he wasn't specific enough.	0
Why wasn't he more specific?	0
So in my second statement, I got really specific, and they said, why didn't he do it faster?	0
The -- I'm telling you folks, look, look, I know these people probably better than anybody.	0
And a lot of people have a problem with it, because look, what happens with them, if they're doing a story about me, I know if it's honest or false.	0
If you're reading a story about somebody, you don't know.	0
You assume it's honest, because it's like the failing New York Times, which is like so bad.	0
It's so bad.	0
[Booing]	0
Or the Washington Post, which call a lobbying tool for Amazon, OK, that's a lobbying tool for Amazon.	0
Or CNN, which is so bad and so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.	0
[Booing]	0
Right?	0
[Crowd chants CNN Sucks]	0
But all the networks -- I mean, CNN is really bad, but ABC this morning -- I don't watch it much, but I'm watching in the morning, and they have little George Stephanopoulos talking to Nikki Haley, right?	0
Little George.	0
And -- and he talks about the speech I made last night, which believe it or not, got great reviews, right?	0
They had a hard time.	0
They were having a hard time because it was with soldiers, we were somber, we were truthful, we were doing -- we were saying things -- and it really did.	0
"So, he talked about it for like that much, then he goes, ""Let's get back to Charlottesville."""	0
Charlottesville.	0
And Nikki was great.	0
She's doing a great job, by the way.	0
So now, I say we have to heal our wounds and the wounds of our country.	0
I love the people of our country, the people, all of the people.	0
It says I love all of the people of our country.	0
I didn't say I love you because you're black, or I love you because you're white, or I love you because you're from Japan, or you're from China, or you're from Kenya, or you're from Scotland or Sweden.	0
I love all the people of our country.	0
"So, I said here's my -- this is -- by the way folks, this is my exact words: ""I love all the people of our country."	0
"We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make it great for all of the people of the United States of America."""	0
And then they say, is he a racist?	0
Is he a racist?	0
Then, I did a second one.	0
So then I did a second one.	0
Don't bother, it's only a single voice.	0
And not a very powerful voice.	0
How did he get in here?	0
He's supposed to be with the few people outside.	0
How about -- how about all week they're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside.	0
Where are they?	0
Well, it's hot out.	0
It is hot.	0
I think it's too warm.	0
You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything -- Antifa!	0
So on August the 14th -- so that was it, and I said all people, I love all people, everything, right?	0
Now I figure I'm going to do it again.	0
I'll be even more specific.	0
So I said, based on the events that took place over the last weekend in Charlottesville, I'd like to provide the nation with an update.	0
Because that was right after the event, the first one, right?	0
An update on ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everybody.	0
To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable, justice will be delivered.	0
That's what I said.	0
Listen to that, I said that, but they don't show that.	0
They don't show it.	0
They take -- they'll take one thing, like, seriously, he was late was the best thing.	0
He was late.	0
So I said, to anyone who acted criminally in this weekends racists violence.	0
OK, then I go, we must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.	0
We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans, right?	0
Then I said, racism is evil.	0
Do they report that I said that racism is evil?	0
You know why?	0
Because they are very dishonest people.	0
So I said, racism is evil.	0
Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am.	0
But, I mean do you ever see anything -- and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings.	1
Because they're putting like seven people all negative on Trump.	0
And they fired Jeffrey Lord, poor Jeffrey.	0
Jeffrey Lord.	0
I guess he was getting a little fed up, and he was probably fighting back a little bit too hard.	0
They said, we've better get out of here; we can't have that.	0
And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold true as Americans.	0
Now let me ask you, can it be any better than that, in all fairness?	0
And you know I mention that, but to the best of my knowledge when there was a big problem, Barack Obama never said it took place because of radical Islamic terrorists, he never said that, right. He doesn't have to say...	0
[Booing]	0
You know why?	0
Because they have a double standard.	0
Because the media is totally dishonest, and they have a double standard.	0
You never heard them say that.	0
And in fact, if you use the term you'd get criticized.	0
But with me, they wanted me to say it, and I said it.	0
And I said it very clearly, but they refused to put it on.	0
Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike the very core of America.	0
These are my words.	0
This was on Monday, August 14th.	0
So you had Saturday; you had Monday.	0
You know, I was going to do one of these every week, but you would never get it right.	0
In times such as these, America has always shown its true character.	0
Responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.	0
"And then I finished, I said, ""We will defend or protect the sacred rights of all Americans."""	0
All is capitalized times five.	0
Not just you.	0
And we will work together so that every citizen -- every citizen is free to follow their dreams and their hearts and to express the love and joy in their souls.	0
OK now, I mean -- so they were having a hard time with that one, because I said everything.	0
I hit him with neo-Nazi.	0
I hit them with everything.	0
I got the white supremacists, the neo-Nazi.	0
I got them all in there, let's say.	0
KKK, we have KKK.	0
I got them all.	0
So they're having a hard time.	0
So what are they say, right?	0
It should have been sooner.	0
He's a racist.	0
It should have been sooner, OK.	0
"So it should have been -- so then the last one, on Tuesday -- Tuesday I did another one: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence."	0
"It has no place in America."""	0
But they also said that he must be a racist because he never mentioned the driver of the car, who is a terrible person, drove the car and he killed Heather, and it's a terrible thing.	0
But they said I didn't mention, so these are my words.	0
The driver of the car is a murderer, and what he did was a horrible, inexcusable thing.	0
They said I didn't mention it.	0
And then they asked me, just to finish it, they asked me, what about race relations in the United States?	0
Now I have to say they were pretty bad under Barack Obama, that I can tell you.	0
But, they asked me the question.	0
And I said, well, I think jobs can have a very big and positive impact.	0
I think if we continue to create jobs like I've done -- over one million since I've been in office...	0
Way over one million.	0
I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I'm creating jobs, I think that's going to have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.	0
I do.	0
I do.	0
And the other thing -- very important -- I believe wages will start going up, because we now have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in 17 years, so you're going to see wages go up, right?	1
They haven't gone up for a long time.	0
I believe wages now, because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up, and I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations.	0
So that was my words.	0
Now, you know, I was a good student.	0
I always hear about the elite.	0
You know, the elite.	0
They're elite?	0
I went to better schools than they did.	0
I was a better student than they were.	0
I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great.	0
I think -- you know what?	0
I think we're the elites.	0
They're not the elites.	0
So the point is -- and I didn't want to bore you, because you understand where I'm coming from.	0
You people understand.	0
But the point is, that those were three different -- there were two statements and one news conference.	0
The words were perfect.	0
They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain.	0
But they don't put on those words.	0
And they don't put on me saying those words.	0
The media can attack me.	0
But where I draw the line is when they attack you, which is what they do.	0
When they attack the decency of our supporters.	0
You are honest, hard-working, taxpaying -- and by the way, you're overtaxed, but we're going to get your taxes down.	0
You're taxpaying Americans who love our nation, obey our laws, and care for our people.	0
It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions, and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions.	0
And yes, by the way -- and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage.	0
You see that.	0
[Booing]	0
And -- and I say it, and you know, we're all pros.	0
We're all, like, we have a certain sense.	0
We're smart people.	0
These are truly dishonest people.	0
And not all of them.	0
Not all of them.	0
You have some very good reporters.	0
You have some very fair journalists.	0
But for the most part, honestly, these are really, really dishonest people, and they're bad people.	0
And I really think they don't like our country.	0
I really believe that.	0
And I don't believe they're going to change, and that's why I do this.	0
If they would change, I would never say it.	0
The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news.	0
Oh, that's so funny.	0
Look back there, the live red lights.	0
They're turning those suckers off fast out there.	0
They're turning those lights off fast.	0
Like CNN.	0
CNN does not want its falling viewership to watch what I'm saying tonight, I can tell you.	0
I mean, the advantage I have -- the advantage I have is that we do have a big voice.	0
And you know, they're always saying, like Twitter or social media -- if I didn't have social media, I wouldn't be able to get the word out.	0
I probably wouldn't be standing here, right?	0
I probably wouldn't be standing here right now.	0
If I don't have social media, I probably would not be standing.	0
"And do you ever notice, when I go on and I'll put, like, out a tweet or a couple of tweets, ""He's in a Twitter-storm again!"""	0
I -- I don't do Twitter-storms.	0
"You know, you'll put out a little tweet: ""I'm going to be with the veterans today."""	0
"They'll say, ""Donald Trump is in a Twitter-storm."""	0
These are sick people.	0
You know the thing I don't understand?	0
You would think -- you would think they'd want to make our country great again, and I honestly believe they don't.	0
I honestly believe it.	0
If you want to discover the source of the division in our country, look no further than the fake news and the crooked media, which would rather get ratings and clicks than tell the truth.	0
I mean, the New York Times has written some stories.	0
How about this?	0
The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election, because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized.	1
I would say they did.	0
They say, well, it wasn't really that much of an apology.	0
Because they were losing so many people, because they were misled.	0
And I figured, this is great.	0
And for about two weeks I got good coverage.	0
Then they reverted back into worse than ever before.	0
You know, it's like one of those things.	0
The Washington Post is terrible.	0
But these are dishonest -- but let me tell you, you have some great, honest papers.	0
You have some great networks.	0
I must tell you, Fox has treated me fairly.	0
Fox treated me fairly.	0
They've treated me fairly.	0
Hey, I'll let you know.	0
You know what?	0
Some day they might not treat me fairly, and I'll tell you about it, OK?	0
But they've treated me fairly, and I don't mean all good.	0
I get plenty of bad on Fox, too.	0
But at least it's within reason.	0
And Hannity?	0
How good is that?	0
How good is Hannity?	0
And he's a great guy, and he's an honest guy.	0
"And ""Fox and Friends in the Morning"" is the best show, and it's the absolute, most honest show, and it's the show I watch."	0
Not only does -- oh boy, those cameras are going off.	0
Oh, wow.	0
Why don't you just fold them up and take them home?	0
Oh, those cameras are going off.	0
Wow.	0
That's the one thing, they're very nervous to have me on live television, because this can happen.	0
Now, you know what?	0
I'm a person that wants to tell the truth.	0
I'm an honest person, and what I'm saying, you know is exactly right.	0
Not only does the media give a platform to hate groups, but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets, the failures of our public school, the destruction of our wealth at the hands of the terrible, terrible trade deals made by politicians that should've never been allowed to be politicians.	0
And the unaccountable hostility against our incredible police, who work so hard at such a dangerous job.	0
My administration is committed to the idea that all Americans have the right to live in safety, security and peace.	0
We believe in the rule of law, because we know that freedom cannot exist if our people are not safe.	0
And how safe are you at a Trump rally?	0
Remember at the beginning, remember when this already started?	0
When this started at the beginning, they used to send in thugs.	0
They had -- our people are tougher than them, so it wasn't always very good for them.	0
But they'd send in thugs, and our people would protect themselves, and then you'd go home and you'd watch this violence.	0
Let me tell you, see this room?	0
You've got people outside, but not very many.	0
But see this room?	0
You're safe in this room.	0
You're very safe in this room.	0
It's a big room.	0
The most sacred duty of government is to protect the lives of its citizens, and that includes securing our borders, and enforcing our immigration laws.	0
By the way, I'm just curious.	0
Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?	0
So, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?	0
That's why...	0
He should have had a jury, but you know what?	0
I'll make a prediction.	0
I think he's going to be just fine, OK?	0
But -- but I won't do it tonight, because I don't want to cause any controversy.	0
Is that OK?	0
All right?	0
But Sheriff Joe can feel good.	0
The people of Arizona know the deadly and heartbreaking consequences of illegal immigration, the lost lives, the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking.	0
MS-13 -- we're throwing them out so fast, they never got thrown out of anything like this.	0
We are liberating towns out on Long Island.	0
We're liberating.	0
Can you imagine, in this day and age -- in this day and age in this country, we are liberating towns.	0
This is like from a different age.	0
We are taking these people.	0
They don't shoot people, because it's too fast and not painful.	0
They cut them up into little pieces.	0
These are animals.	0
We are getting them out of here.	0
We're throwing them in jails, and we're throwing them out of the country.	0
We're liberating our towns.	0
You're seen it.	0
You've lived it, and you elected me to put a stop to it.	0
And we are doing a phenomenal job of putting a stop to it.	0
That I can tell you.	0
After years of defending other countries borders -- can you believe we fight for other countries; we want to defend their borders -- we're finally defending our own borders.	0
And we're showing compassion for these struggling American workers who are now starting to see the light because plants are coming pouring back into our country.	0
And by the way, we're doing a lot of good work on that, but a lot of people are coming back in.	0
We have Foxconn, they make the iPhones, as you know, for Apple, and so many companies are building now in our country.	0
Including the auto companies who are coming back.	0
Years of uncontrolled immigration have placed enormous pressure on the jobs and wages of working families, and they've put great burdens on local schools and hospitals.	0
While this may be good for a handful of special interests, it's unfair to working people of all backgrounds all throughout our country.	0
We want every American community to succeed, including our immigrant communities, but they can't do that if we don't control our borders.	0
Earlier today, I visited with the incredible men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol during a visit to Yuma Sector.	0
I was over at the Yuma Sector.	0
It was hot.	0
It was like 115 degrees.	0
I'm out signing autographs for an hour.	0
I was there.	0
That was a hot day.	0
You learn if you're in shape if you can do that, believe me.	0
And they actually told me -- actually, sir, it's relatively cool today.	0
Can you believe that?	0
[Laughter]	0
But it was great.	0
And I met with the Border Patrol and I met with ICE, and these are incredible people; the job they do.	0
And in fact, General Kelly, who was in charge of Homeland Security, where people coming in down 78 and almost 80 percent.	1
He did so good, I made him my chief of staff, right?	0
That made sense.	0
John, where's John?	0
Where is he?	0
Where's General Kelly?	0
Get him out here.	0
He's great.	0
He's doing a great job.	0
But we did a lot before anything happened, we did a lot.	0
We respect and cherish our ICE officers and our Border Patrol agents, and we respect and cherish our police officers, and our firemen, and all of our uniform services.	0
But during that visit, I heard first hand from the frontline agents about the security threats they confront each and every day, and I pledged my continued resolve to them, and all of you, to keep our country safe.	0
All around the nation, I have spent time with the wonderful Americans whose children were killed for the simple reason that our government failed to enforce our immigration laws, already existing laws.	0
And I promised these families, the deaths of their loved ones will not have been in vain.	0
I promised them.	0
I know so many of them.	0
One by one we are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminals who prey on our people.	0
We are throwing them out of the country or we're putting the hell, fast in jail.	0
We are cracking down on these sanctuary cities that shield criminal aliens, finally.	0
And we are building a wall on the southern border which is absolutely necessary.	0
[Crowd Chants Build that Wall]	0
Build that wall.	0
Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it.	0
But believe me, if we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.	0
Let me be very clear to Democrats in Congress who oppose a border wall and stand in the way of border security: You are putting all of America's safety at risk.	0
You're doing that.	0
You're doing that.	0
Again, the Border Patrol today, I said, how important is the wall to some of the folks?	0
I met with a lot of them.	0
And they looked at me, they said, it's vital.	0
It's vital.	0
It's so vital.	0
And you know, we have walls.	0
I don't know if you know, we're already starting to fix a lot of the walls we already have, because we don't have to rebuild them.	0
And we want walls that you can see through in a sense.	0
You want to see what's on the other side.	0
But we're starting to fix a lot of the walls.	0
We've done a lot of work.	0
But I said to them, how are we doing and how important are the walls?	0
And they said, Mr. President, you have no idea.	0
It is desperately needed.	0
We're going to have our wall.	0
We're going to get our wall.	0
And that wall is also going to help us, very importantly, with the drug problem, and the massive amounts of drugs that are pouring across the southern border.	0
My administration will never back down in demanding immigration control.	0
The American people voted for immigration control.	0
That's one of the reasons I'm here, and that is what the American people deserve, and they're going to get it.	0
So you put pressure, but believe me, one way or the other, we're going to get that wall.	0
Immigration security is also a matter, remember this, of national security.	0
That's why we're implementing tough new vetting and screening protocols to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.	0
You look at what just happened in Spain and so many other places.	0
Nope.	0
We're really vetting.	0
We're tough. Does anybody want me to be soft on the vetting or would you like --	0
[Crowd yells No]	0
Extreme vetting -- I came up with that term.	0
That's what it has to be.	0
So I have a message for Congress tonight: You're job is to represent American families, American people, American workers.	0
That's your job.	0
You need to represent them on the border, on taxes, on healthcare -- one vote -- and on every other issue that affects their lives.	0
And for our friends in the Senate, oh boy -- the Senate, remember this -- look, the Senate, we have to get rid of what's called the filibuster rule; we have to.	0
And if we don't, the Republicans will never get anything passed.	0
You're wasting your time.	0
We have to get rid of the filibuster rule.	0
Right now, we need 60 votes and we have 52 Republicans.	0
That means that eight Democrats are controlling all of this legislation.	0
We have over 200 bills.	0
[Booing]	0
And we have to speak to Mitch and we have to speak to everybody.	0
And I want to tell you, we have some great, great Republican senators.	0
We really do, and they fought like hell to get that thing approved.	0
They fought.	0
They really did.	0
They really fought.	0
Now, even on healthcare, because of reconciliation, which, if you don't know, it doesn't matter.	0
It's a trick.	0
We needed 51 votes.	0
But when you need 51, and you have 52, and we include the vice president, who always votes with us.	0
He's the greatest.	0
But you have no margin.	0
But some of the best things in healthcare require 60 votes.	0
So even when you say we're voting on healthcare, like across state lines, purchase across state lines.	0
One of the most important things, I've been talking about it for two years during debates.	0
It gives competition.	0
Insurance companies come in, your prices go way down.	0
Arizona is a disaster in terms of the price increase of your insurance, 116 percent interest.	1
You got to get rid of the filibuster rule.	0
You've got to go to a majority.	0
You've got to go to 51 votes, and if they don't do that they're -- they're just wasting time.	0
All of the Democrats in Congress, that's the only thing they do well.	0
They do one thing well.	0
You know what it's called?	0
They have no ideas.	0
They have no policies.	0
They obstruct.	0
That's all they do.	0
They're word is, we resist.	0
They don't resist; they obstruct.	0
It's all they're good at.	0
It's all they're good at.	0
That's all they do.	0
On healthcare, they have 48 Democrats.	0
We got no votes.	0
We got no votes.	0
And it would have been great healthcare.	0
And by the way, would have been great healthcare for Arizona.	0
Would have been great.	0
So the Democrats have no ideas, no policy, no vision for the country other than total socialism and maybe, frankly, a step beyond socialism from what I'm seeing.	0
[Booing]	0
Under they're plan for America, your taxes will double or triple, your service will diminish and your borders will be left wide open for everybody to come in and enjoy our country.	0
[Booing]	0
Obamacare is a disaster and think -- think, we were just one vote away from victory after seven years of everybody proclaiming repeal and replace.	0
One vote away.	0
One vote away.	0
We were one vote away.	0
Think of it, seven years the Republicans -- and again, you have some great senators, but we were one vote away from repealing it.	0
[Crowd chanting]	0
But, you know, they all said, Mr.	0
President, your speech was so good last night, please, please, Mr. President don't mention any names.	0
So I won't.	0
I won't.	0
No I won't vote -- one vote away, I will not mention any names.	0
Very presidential, isn't' it?	0
Very presidential.	0
And nobody wants me to talk about your other senator, who's weak on borders, weak on crime, so I won't talk about him.	0
[Booing]	0
Nobody wants me to talk about him.	0
Nobody knows who the hell he is.	0
And now -- see, I haven't' mentioned any names.	0
So now, everybody's happy.	0
But we are going to get rid of Obamacare.	0
I will never stop -- one vote -- I will never stop.	0
We're going to get rid of Obamacare.	0
Every day we're keeping our promises, and that includes our promises to our great, great veterans.	0
Who's a veteran here?	0
It's getting better, getting really good.	0
Nobody's fixed it -- nobody's been able to do it.	0
And remember, I'm only here for less than eight months, you know.	0
When they talk about Obamacare, it was years. When they talk Hillary Clinton spent eight years trying to get...	0
[Booing]	0
Eight years trying to get health care.	0
[Crowd chanting]	0
Well, it's obvious that we won the state of Arizona, do you agree with that?	0
It's pretty obvious.	0
And we won it by a lot.	0
And I hear we're winning it by even more right now.	0
But if you think about it, Clinton, they spent eight years that they weren't able to get health care.	0
Other administrations spent all of their time, they weren't able to get it.	0
Obama, what he did to get it.	0
What he did to get it, including the guy, Gruber.	0
Did you see Gruber got fired yesterday?	0
He got fired because he defrauded somebody or something.	0
Something very bad happened.	0
Check it out.	0
Something happened.	0
Gruber, who lied about Obamacare, who called everybody fools for believing it.	0
Obamacare is gone.	0
It's a disaster.	0
It's gone.	0
Premiums in other states are going up in numbers that are even higher than the state of Arizona.	0
Insurance companies are fleeing, and it's gone.	0
So we're going to -- I really believe that the Republicans -- and maybe we'll get a couple of senators that think they're going to lose their race on the Democratic side, maybe, but we'll get it fixed.	0
One vote -- speak to your Senator, please.	0
Speak to your Senator.	0
We're reforming the V.A.	0
to ensure our veterans have the care they so richly deserve, including choice -- choice -- choice.	0
In other words, if you've got to wait for seven days and you're not feeling well, you go see a doctor and we pay for your doctor.	0
Isn't that good?	0
And we've got legislation approved that everybody said was impossible.	0
It's called V.A.	0
Accountability.	0
If somebody treats our veterans badly, we can fire them.	0
We say you're fired; get out of here.	0
Everybody said -- everybody said you couldn't get that -- they've been trying to get that passed for 40 years.	0
We got great legislation.	0
You ever hear of these liars back there, where they say, but Trump hasn't gotten -- I think we've gotten more in a short period of time, in this seven months,	0
I think we've gotten more than anybody, including Harry Truman, who was number one, but they will tell you we've got none.	0
So we got V.A.	0
Accountability so that you can fire people that are treating our veterans badly or aren't doing their jobs.	0
Isn't that great?	0
We've also obtained historic increase in defense spending to prevent and deter conflict.	1
We believe in peace through strength.	0
We're building up our military like never before.	0
Thousands and thousands of brave Americans have paid the ultimate price for our freedom.	0
Now it's up to us to preserve and protect their legacy.	0
Last night, as you know, I laid out my vision for I'm honorable and enduring outcome in a very tough place, a place where country has failed, Afghanistan.	0
This is the place where terrorists are trained, where you have people that are not exactly United States fans, can I say that?	0
And I will tell you then what we're going to do with our incredible military, they're going to make unbelievable sacrifices, and they've already made, in some cases, the ultimate sacrifice.	0
But we're fighting for them.	0
Our warfighters deserve the tools they need, and the trust they've earned to fight and to win.	0
Fight and to win.	0
And you see what's going on in North Korea.	0
All of a sudden, I don't know -- who knows.	0
But I can tell you, what I said, that's not strong enough.	0
Some people said it's too strong, it's not strong enough.	0
But Kim Jong Un, I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us.	0
I respect that fact very much.	0
Respect that fact.	0
And maybe -- probably not -- but maybe something positive can come about.	0
They won't tell you that, but maybe something positive can come about.	0
Every American deserves a government that protects them, honors them, defends them, and fights for them.	0
And by the way, speaking of that, you have three congressman in the audience and your governor who met me at the plane, and he's now inside, but he said I want to spend my time outside on security.	0
I said, I think that's a great idea, governor.	0
But not that many people showed up so I don't think it should be much of a problem.	0
But you have a hell of a governor, Governor Ducey.	0
You have a great governor.	0
And we have three congressman, a friend of mine who has been so great to me, Trent Franks.	0
Where is Congressman Franks?	0
Where is he?	0
Get over here.	0
Paul Gosar, Congressman, Congressman Andy Biggs.	0
Get up here, fellow.	0
Thank you, fellows.	0
Thank you, congressman.	0
Never let them go, folks.	0
Never let them go.	0
Don't ever lose them.	0
Thank you, fellows.	0
So, in Washington, we're taking power out of the hands of donors and special interests, and putting that power back into the hands of the people that voted for us, OK?	0
For us.	0
The same failed voices in Washington who opposed our movement are the same people who gave us one terrible trade deal after another; who gave us one foreign policy disaster after another; who sacrificed our sovereignty, our wealth, and our jobs.	0
We don't need advice from the Washington, D.C. swamp.	0
[Booing]	0
We need, right now, to drain the swamp.	0
That's what's happening, too, believe me.	0
Washington is full of people who are only looking out for themselves.	0
But I don't come to Washington for me.	0
You know, I've had a great life.	0
I've had great success.	0
I've enjoyed my life.	0
Most people think I'm crazy to have done this.	0
And I think they're right.	0
But I enjoy it, because we've made so much -- I don't believe that any president -- I don't believe that any president has accomplished as much as this president in the first six or seven months.	0
I really don't believe it.	0
Including -- including a great Supreme Court justice, Justice Gorsuch. Big	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
I came to Washington for you.	0
Your dreams are my dreams.	0
Your hopes are my hopes.	0
And your future is what I'm fighting for each and every day.	0
It's so important.	0
Our agenda is the pro-worker agenda.	0
We've accomplished historic amounts in a short period of time.	0
We've signed more than 50 pieces of legislation.	0
They said we've signed none -- none.	0
We've signed 50; appointed Justice Gorsuch; nominated 31 new federal judges, with many more on the way.	0
So, importantly, we have aggressively canceled job-killing regulations, and we're unleashing job-creating American energy like we've never unleashed before.	0
We've ended the war on beautiful, clean coal, and it's just been announced that a second, brand-new coal mine, where they're going to take out clean coal -- meaning, they're taking out coal.	0
They're going to clean it -- is opening in the state of Pennsylvania, the second one.	0
And the state of West Virginia, which was way behind and lagging, was now, in terms of GDP increase, second last quarter to the state of Texas.	0
How about that?	0
West Virginia.	0
And they have a great governor in West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice, who just quit the Democrats and joined the Republican Party.	0
In the proud tradition of America's great leaders, from George Washington -- please, don't take his statue down, please.	0
Please.	0
Does anybody want George Washington's statue?	0
No.	0
Is that sad?	0
Is that all sad?	0
To Lincoln, to Teddy Roosevelt, I see they want to take Teddy Roosevelt's down, too.	0
They're trying to figure out why.	0
They don't know.	0
They're trying to take away our culture.	0
They are trying to take away our history.	0
And our weak leaders, they do it overnight.	0
These things have been there for 150 years, for 100 years.	0
You go back to a university, and it's gone.	0
Weak, weak people.	0
We are going to protect American industry.	0
We are going to protect the American worker.	0
No longer will we allow other countries to close our factories, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth.	0
We are building our future with American hands, American labor, American iron, aluminum, and steel.	0
We will buy American, and we will hire American.	0
I immediately withdrew the United States from the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
Would have been a disaster.	0
And you know, that one of the worst deals that anybody in history has ever entered into.	0
We have begun formal renegotiation with Mexico and Canada on NAFTA.	0
And I must be honest, and I've been talking about NAFTA for a long time, and I'm sorry it's taken six months, but we have to give notice.	0
You have to see this.	0
We have to give notice, and after the notice is given, you have to wait a long time.	0
Then you have to give another one, then you have to wait a long time.	0
Anyway, we started two days ago, Bob Lighthizer.	0
Personally, I don't think we can make a deal, because we have been so badly taken advantage of/ They have made such great deals, both of the countries, but in particular, Mexico, that I don't think we can make a deal.	0
So I think we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA at some point, OK?	0
Probably.	0
But -- but I told you from the first day, we will renegotiate NAFTA, or we will terminate NAFTA.	0
I personally don't think you can make a deal without a termination, but we're going to see what happens, OK?	0
You're in -- you're in good hands, I can tell you.	0
We are unleashing American energy, and I withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.	0
People have no idea how bad that was for this country.	0
Great for other countries.	0
We were like the lap dog.	0
Great for other countries.	0
Our country was so behind.	0
Since I took the oath of office, we've added far more than one million jobs in the private sector.	0
Unemployment is, right now, at almost a 17-year low.	0
Wages are rising.	0
The stock market is at its all-time high in history, and economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent.	0
Remember, everybody said you won't bring it up to 1 percent.	0
You won't bring it up to 1.2 percent.	0
And we've just started.	0
Those regulations that we've gotten rid of, which -- and we're going to have some regulation, but it's going to be sensible regulation.	0
Those regulations are unleashing our economy.	0
So we have a GDP, it was shocking, about two weeks ago it was announced for the quarter: 2.6 percent.	0
Remember, I said we're going to try and hit 3 percent?	0
We're already at 2.6.	0
Maybe I'll have to increase my offer.	0
And so many of those people, you know, the Economic Council?	0
When it got a little heat with the lies from the media, they sort of said, Oh, we'll take a pass.	0
Not all of them, but some of them did.	0
But I remember the ones that did.	0
But they'll say, We take -- oh, we'll take -- but people are now calling me, people that have been, like, we'll take a pass -- Don, can we get together for lunch?	0
Let's do it privately, instead of through a council.	0
These people just don't get it.	0
They are calling, and they're saying, how about getting together privately?	0
They like it better.	0
Why should they be on a council?	0
You know, that's the way it is, folks.	0
That's the way it is.	0
To bring more jobs and industry to our shores, we are committed to passing the first major tax reform in over 30 years.	0
Now, we need the help of Congress, please.	0
OK?	0
We need the help of Congress.	0
And we really could use some Democrat help.	0
We're giving you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.	0
The Democrats are going to find a way to obstruct.	0
If they do, remember, they are stopping from getting a massive tax cut.	0
Just remember that, OK?	0
America's crushing business tax is a massive, self-inflicted, economic wound.	0
We have one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, pushing jobs and wealth out of our country.	0
That is why we are going to lower the tax on American business, to bring back those companies, bring them back to America.	0
"We want more products stamped with the letters, ""Made in the U.S.A.""."	0
We also want everyday Americans to be able to keep more of their own money.	0
So for the Democratic senators, especially the ones where I won their states by 20 and 30 points, I really hope you're going to come over to our side.	0
Because again, when you have 52 Republicans, if you lose like two, that's the end.	0
You know what, as good as something is, it's hard to get 51 out of 52.	0
So I hope some of the Democrats that are going to lose their election will come over and give everybody a big beautiful tax cut, which is going to be great for the economy.	0
It's time to pass a tax cut for the middle-class families.	0
We will make America the best place in the world to hire, grow and start a business again.	0
We want to lift our people from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.	0
We're going to do an infrastructure bill.	0
We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, waterways, all across our beautiful land.	0
Our greatest creations, our most incredible buildings, our most beautiful works of art are just waiting to be brought to life.	0
American hands will build this future.	0
American energy will power this future.	0
We have become an energy exporter for the first time ever just recently.	0
And American workers will bring this future to life.	0
We are the nation that dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, put a man on the moon, and defeated communism.	0
We can do anything, we can build anything and we can dream anything.	0
It's time to remember what our brave soldiers never forgot.	0
Americans share one flag, one home and one glorious destiny.	0
We live according to the same law, raise our children by the same values, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.	0
As long as we remember these truths, as long as we have enough strength and courage in ourselves, then there is no challenge too great, no task too large, no dream beyond our reach.	0
We are Americans, and the future belongs to us.	0
The future belongs to all of you.	0
This is our moment.	0
This is our chance.	0
This is our opportunity to recapture our dynasty like never before, to rebuild our future, to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in America.	0
Freedom will prevail, our values will endure, our citizens will prosper, Arizona will thrive, and our beloved nation will succeed like never, ever before.	0
So to Americans young and old, near and far, in cities small and large, we say these words again tonight: We will make America strong again.	0
We will make America wealthy again.	0
We will make America proud again.	0
We will make America safe again.	0
And we will make America great again.	0
Thank you Arizona.	0
God bless you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.	0
We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire.	0
Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this.	0
Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.	0
And neither party has seen this yet.	0
These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president.	0
Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.	0
And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions—show us the differences between them.	0
That's the whole reason that we're here tonight.	0
We're not here for talking points.	0
We're to learn about the difference between the candidates.	0
And with that, let's get going.	0
Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.	0
[ applause ]	0
First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire Union Leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we'll be addressing tonight.	0
The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.	0
And with that, that's it.	0
We're going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates.	0
And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we're going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.	0
Rachel, thank you very much.	0
Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process.	0
And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.	0
They are working longer hours for low wages.	0
They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.	1
Not what America is supposed to be about.	0
Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about.	0
And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.	0
Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United.	0
One person, one vote.	0
That's what American democracy is about.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Secretary Clinton.	0
Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.	0
I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed.	0
And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.	0
Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans.	0
Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.	0
But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.	0
I believe that we can get back on the right track.	0
I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.	0
I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep.	0
All right.	0
Let's get started.	0
"Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, ""It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable."""	0
So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.	0
Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals.	0
I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it.	0
I don't want us to start over again.	0
I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.	0
I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage.	0
And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar.	0
So we have a difference.	0
I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs.	0
What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college.	0
I want to get the economy going again.	0
It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is.	0
I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power.	0
I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.	0
And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work.	0
But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing.	0
That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.	0
Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do.	0
A progressive is someone who makes progress.	0
That's what I intend to do.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed.	0
Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?	0
Well, I haven't quite run for president before.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made.	0
And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here.	0
I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.	0
Here is the issue.	0
Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are.	0
So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.	0
I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.	0
Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce.	0
This is 2016.	0
When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade.	0
I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free.	0
Well, how do we pay for that?	0
It's an expensive proposition.	0
I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people.	0
We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.	0
The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need.	0
Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class.	0
[ applause ]	0
If I could just follow up on that.	0
[ applause ]	0
There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.	0
The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it.	0
I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down.	0
Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again.	0
This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country.	0
It is helping people right now.	0
I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding.	0
Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me...	0
Go.	0
... this is a good discussion here.	0
Yes, go ahead.	0
And let me just say this.	0
As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee.	0
That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act.	0
The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate.	0
The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.	0
So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here—I helped write that bill—but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right, thank you both.	0
Rachel.	0
Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee.	0
He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer.	0
Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?	0
Well because I am a progressive who gets things done.	0
And the root of that word, progressive, is progress.	0
But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.	0
Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact.	0
Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.	0
You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country.	0
But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.	0
[ applause ]	0
I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.	0
I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform.	0
So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do.	0
That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress.	0
That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?	0
No, not at all.	0
Here's the reality of American economic life today.	0
The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process.	0
The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.	0
The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing.	0
So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution—contributors.	0
Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas.	0
Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States.	0
Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.	0
That is not a radical idea.	0
What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors.	0
When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.	0
Thank you Senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator.	0
President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty.	0
President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can't be both.	0
Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?	0
Let me just pick up on this point.	0
This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary.	0
She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been—I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate.	0
Well, I am a moderate.	0
That's where this came from.	0
It wasn't me paraphrasing her.	0
It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate.	0
But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive.	0
In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit.	0
The world's financial system on the verge of collapse.	0
I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job.	0
We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago.	0
That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.	0
Do I think President Obama is a progressive?	0
Yes, I do.	0
I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement.	0
But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.	0
Well, Chuck...	0
...Secretary Clinton, go ahead...	0
...	0
If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.	0
Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund.	0
It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies.	0
Before it was called Hillarycare—I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program.	0
Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.	0
So, again...	0
[ applause ]	0
...I think it's important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself.	0
I understand that, that's what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let's not be—in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I've always stood.	0
It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.	0
And, that's what we ought to be celebrating.	0
Let's talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
30 seconds, and then we'll move.	0
That's right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let's talk about...	0
... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...	0
... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk.	0
I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...	0
[ applause ]	0
... And special interests.	0
I am enormously proud.	0
Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece.	0
That is what the political revolution means.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire.	0
But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.	0
In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.	0
How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?	0
Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn't accurate.	0
In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points.	0
I came in second.	0
It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat.	0
In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me.	0
And it is true...	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
...it is true, it's not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress.	0
People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent.	0
That is true.	0
But on the other hand, I have—when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats.	0
In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course.	0
And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I'm very proud of.	0
And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.	0
I am running for president as a Democrat.	0
And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.	0
I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn't exist now.	0
And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton.	0
You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials.	0
Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator.	0
I really appreciate that.	0
And I think it's because they've worked with me, they've seen what I do.	0
They know what kind of a colleague I am.	0
They want me as their partner in the White House.	0
And that's exactly what I will do.	0
We'll get things done together.	0
Democrats, Republicans, independents, we're going to make progress together when I'm president.	0
[ applause ]	0
So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats.	0
She's implying that that says something about the people who know you best.	0
Well, I don't see it quite like that.	0
How do you see it?	0
I am—will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House.	0
She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her.	0
That's a fact.	0
I don't deny it.	0
But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece.	0
That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out.	0
That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.	0
So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment.	0
I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.	0
Secretary.	0
Well, look, I've got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.	0
And I've got to tell you that it is...	0
[ applause ]	0
...it is really quite amusing to me.	0
People support me because they know me.	0
They know my life's work.	0
They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders.	0
And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.	0
[ applause ]	0
I am not going to make promises I can't keep.	0
I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.	0
A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.	0
I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead.	0
That is not my agenda.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, you'll have 30 seconds to respond to that.	0
What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.	0
To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.	0
Yeah, but I—I think it's fair to really ask what's behind that comment.	0
You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign.	0
I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.	0
But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to—you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.	0
And I just absolutely reject that, Senator.	0
And I really don't think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you.	0
And enough is enough.	0
If you've got something to say, say it directly.	0
But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.	0
What...	0
[ applause ]	0
And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I'm very proud of that.	0
... you know...	0
So I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
[ applause ]	0
... in recent weeks, and let's talk...	0
[ booing ]	0
...let's talk about about the issues.	0
Let's talk about the issues that divide us.	0
Let's talk about—OK, let's talk...	0
And let's—let's...	0
... let us talk about issues.	0
... we both agree with campaign finance reform.	0
Let's talk about issues.	0
I—I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.	0
Let's...	0
I want to reverse Citizens United.	0
... let's—let's—let's talk about issues.	0
And so—let's talk about issues.	0
Let's talk—let's talk about issues, all right?	0
Let's talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated.	0
Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided—spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?	0
Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Let's ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there's nothing that the government can do to stop it.	0
You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry?	0
Let's talk about climate change.	0
Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system?	0
Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?	0
That is what goes on in America.	0
I am not—I like...	0
[ applause ]	0
...there is a reason.	0
You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system.	0
And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.	0
Well, you know, Senator, I don't think—I don't...	0
[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
... Secretary, we're gonna...	0
...	0
I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.	0
And I'm proud of that.	0
You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance.	0
Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you.	0
I know this game.	0
I'm going to stop this game.	0
But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.	0
So I don't know—I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives.	0
People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage.	0
What we've got to do as Democrats—what we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems.	0
And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.	0
That's what this election should be about.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thirty seconds.	0
[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder.	0
I was on the House Financial Committee at that time.	0
I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans—Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan—about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.	0
Go to YouTube today.	0
Look up Greenspan-Sanders.	0
Listen to what I told them then.	0
I helped lead the effort against deregulation.	0
Unfortunately, we lost that.	0
The result is—was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.	0
Thank you both.	0
Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously we've touched a nerve.	0
We're going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this.	0
Stay with us.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
All right, welcome back.	0
Let's get right to it.	0
Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform.	0
You rail against big money in politics.	0
But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is—it is in place to run for president.	0
Why aren't you walking the walk on that?	0
Why aren't you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?	0
Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster.	0
The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well.	0
But in terms of the early states—Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states—it just doesn't work.	0
Your point is well taken.	0
I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely.	0
But this system is—I don't know if the secretary would agree—is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.	0
Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got—and all this when it is—you know, that's the system?	0
I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing—public financing system...	0
But if the...	0
... and being able to set—being able to set an example.	0
—but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated.	0
It no longer works.	0
Nobody can become president based on that system.	0
So what's the alternative?	0
There are two alternatives.	0
And, you know, we looked at it.	0
Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn't want it.	0
So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign.	0
And you know what?	0
We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece.	0
I think that's pretty good.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...	0
On the issue of Wall Street.	0
... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.	0
Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that's what they offered.	0
Have you been too dismissive of voters' concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?	0
Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record.	0
You know, I did—when I left the secretary of State's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit.	0
I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street.	0
They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.	0
But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash.	0
I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages.	0
I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy.	0
I proposed changes in CEO compensation.	0
I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created.	0
And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary.	0
They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads.	0
Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.	0
And why are they doing that?	0
These are guys who try to make smart investments.	0
They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it.	0
And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.	0
So I do want people to know that, and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street.	0
What about her defense of her record?	0
Let me just say this.	0
Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country.	0
You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.	0
Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans.	0
But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about.	0
These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.	0
Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record.	0
A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record.	0
That is what power is about.	0
That is what corruption is about.	0
And that is what has to change in the United States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change.	0
It has to change.	0
And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that.	0
And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.	0
I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall.	0
But I do not believe that that is enough.	0
And in fact, I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.	0
You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks.	0
And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk.	0
But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.	0
So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem.	0
We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed.	0
My plan takes us further and it would do the job.	0
[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
I would say that—that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation.	0
And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were—significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.	0
And that is what I believe and many economists believe.	0
Time to break them up.	0
[ applause ]	0
Look we have a law—look, you know, I—I appreciate the senator's advocacy.	0
We have a law.	0
It was passed.	0
It was signed by President Obama.	0
It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.	0
And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he's a responsible president.	0
So we have a law in place.	0
If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it.	0
And from what you say, I know you will as well.	0
But that is not enough.	0
And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me—the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys—is because I've got their number on all of that.	0
And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.	0
You know, we can't just fight the last war.	0
We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans.	0
And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.	0
Well, we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation.	0
And here's where we are.	0
The American people can judge.	0
Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.	0
That is a lot of money.	0
They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.	0
That is a lot of power for six financial institutions.	0
That's it.	0
I think it is too much power.	0
Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.	0
Thank you both.	0
Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.	0
Secretary Clinton, it's addressed to you, and it's about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs.	0
This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.	0
"I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money, and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, ""Don't you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?"""	0
But, let's make that bigger.	0
Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches?	0
We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches.	0
In full disclosure, would you release all of them?	0
I will look into it.	0
I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it.	0
But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs.	0
I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.	0
My view on this is look at my record.	0
Look at what I am proposing, and—we have a vigorous agreement here.	0
We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street.	0
I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.	0
I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health.	0
Now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies.	0
We're missing other big energy companies.	0
We're missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.	0
Senator, you sound like you want to respond.	0
Go ahead.	0
Yeah, I do.	0
I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak.	0
Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.	0
That's a fact.	0
And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people.	0
In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud.	0
It's fraud.	0
I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...	0
... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen.	0
I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.	0
This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again.	0
We have no disagreement about this.	0
But, I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people.	0
And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again.	0
Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system.	0
You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart.	0
But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans.	0
That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business.	0
The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.	0
Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you've approached them in this campaign?	0
Of course I can work with them, but let's be clear.	0
When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage.	0
I suspect the secretary agrees request me.	0
Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.	0
And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year?	0
Zero.	0
Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.	0
So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do?	0
We're going to end that loophole.	0
They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.	0
We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.	0
Can I work with corporations?	0
Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development?	0
Absolutely they are.	0
And we should be proud of them.	0
But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do.	0
I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
And with that, we're going to take a break.	0
We'll be right back.	0
And we're going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back—welcome back to the Democratic candidates' debate.	0
We're going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.	0
And Secretary Clinton, we're going to start with you.	0
There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS.	0
It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America's military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.	0
Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that's fighting ISIS right now?	0
Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.	0
I agree with the president.	0
I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq—that is off the table.	0
But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.	0
And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting.	0
We're doing the support and enabling.	0
And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.	0
So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me.	0
We just have to keep—try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back.	0
To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you're describing requires considerably more of Americans—an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?	0
No.	0
I mean, of course that's a theoretical question, and we don't know what it would be for, and we don't know how many numbers there are.	0
I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.	0
I support special forces.	0
I support trainers.	0
I support the air campaign.	0
And I think we're making some progress.	0
I want to continue to intensify that, and that's exactly what the president is doing.	0
Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
Go ahead, Senator Sanders—30 seconds, your response.	0
OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.	0
Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website, berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002.	0
And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.	0
All right.	0
Senator, I want to stay, though...	0
If I could—if I could...	0
Go ahead.	0
30 seconds.	0
... respectfully add—look, we did differ.	0
A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.	0
We have to look at the threats that we face right now...	0
[ applause ]	0
...and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.	0
Let me—let—we're gonna—we're staying—we're staying basically on this topic.	0
Obviously you've been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.	0
Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan.	0
How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?	0
Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq.	0
And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen.	0
I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen—and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said.	0
I think he hit the nail on the head.	0
And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam.	0
And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers—U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.	0
So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate.	0
"But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, ""Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans."""	0
The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support.	0
We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.	0
Can you address a question on Afghanistan?	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
How long are these troops going to be there?	0
If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think they're going to be there?	0
Well, you can't simply withdraw tomorrow.	0
Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country.	0
But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi.	0
ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.	0
Hopefully, and you know, one can't predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.	0
Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan?	0
We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.	0
Oh, absolutely.	0
The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan.	0
We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top—his top partner, Abdullah.	0
And they are doing their very best.	0
And the Afghan army is actually fighting.	0
The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.	0
And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need.	0
Because it's not just the Taliban.	0
We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.	0
So, we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it.	0
And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.	0
You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are.	0
You haven't given a major foreign policy speech.	0
And it doesn't sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when you're asked about it, and you say you're going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.	0
You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet.	0
Why?	0
Well, that's not quite accurate.	0
I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy.	0
Maybe I shouldn't have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn't get much attention.	0
So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.	0
I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq.	0
And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone.	0
We cannot be the policeman of the world.	0
We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense.	0
We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.	0
So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel.	1
Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.	0
So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief.	0
And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.	0
All right, Senator, 30 seconds.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ off-mike ]	0
I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience—hat is not arguable—in foreign affairs.	0
But experience is not the only point, judgment is.	0
And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn't.	0
In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other.	0
That's no great secret.	0
But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.	0
Well, let me just add that, you know, I've said this before and I'm very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State.	0
And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.	0
Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one.	0
There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I'll get to that when I can.	0
That is just not an acceptable approach.	0
Well...	0
Secretary Clinton, at the—at the last Democratic debate in Charleston—I want to get specific here—Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran.	0
Your campaign has criticized him for saying that.	0
Now that he's standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldn't try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?	0
Absolutely.	0
You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions.	0
I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.	0
I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement.	0
It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program.	0
We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it.	0
But that is not our only problem with Iran.	0
We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.	0
They are destabilizing governments in the region.	0
They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel.	0
A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard.	0
I'm prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.	0
If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior.	0
The president doesn't think we should.	0
I certainly don't think we should.	0
I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.	0
Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow?	0
I never said that.	0
I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.	0
And you're right.	0
They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that.	0
But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea.	0
They're Communists, they are our enemy.	0
Well guess what?	0
Change has come.	0
So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow.	0
We don't.	0
But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen.	0
And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary—and you can correct me if I'm wrong.	0
When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies.	0
I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can.	0
You know—let me correct the record.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
30 seconds, madam secretary.	0
As I—as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions.	0
And you're right, I was against that.	0
I was against it then I would be against it now.	0
OK.	0
Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants.	0
"Of course you've got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don't just rush in, open the door, and say, ""Here I am."	0
"Let's talk and make a deal."""	0
That's not the way it works.	0
I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions.	0
But, of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...	0
... Well, we set conditions on Iran.	0
We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked.	0
That's exactly the right...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...and, that's what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.	0
[ applause ]	0
Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.	0
Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, you've got to prioritize potential threats to the United States.	0
Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia.	0
How would you rank them in order of their threat to America's security right now...	0
... ISIS...	0
...	0
Starting with the biggest threat.	0
ISIS, you forgot one...	0
...	0
I didn't say that...	0
... No, no...	0
... No...	0
... ISIS would be ...	0
... We already had that.	0
I'm talking about these three countries.	0
How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.	0
Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid.	0
And, who had nuclear weapons.	0
And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure.	0
China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China.	0
I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.	0
I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.	0
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat.	0
Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that.	0
Do you agree with his decisions...	0
... No, I don't.	0
I worry very, very much about an isolated country.	0
That's what makes me nervous.	0
Russia lives in the world.	0
China lives in the world.	0
North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with.	0
Dealt with effectively.	0
Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.	0
He's basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.	0
I haven't talked to Secretary Carter, but here's what I would think he's planning.	0
We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that's an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on.	0
We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.	0
We do have to worry about North Korea.	0
They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they're working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.	0
And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast.	0
We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.	0
But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia's putting on our European allies.	0
The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe.	0
The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea.	0
Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.	0
We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East.	0
They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria.	0
They want to hang on to that.	0
I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I'm glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense.	0
We've got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to.	0
The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they're actually contributing more to their own defense.	0
Thank you both, Rachel?	0
Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home.	0
There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.	0
If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Party's nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A.	0
It's a newly popular idea in conservative politics.	0
How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A.	0
in the last few years?	0
What's your argument that the V.A.	0
should still exist and should not be privatized?	0
Well, first of all, I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.A.	0
And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.A.	0
There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.	0
But you're absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda.	0
They've actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.	0
I will fight that as hard as I can.	0
I think there's where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let's fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, you've worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues.	0
Is the right contour of the fight, the way she's talking about this issue?	0
Let me agree.	0
You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired—I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.	0
And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans.	0
I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America.	0
That's what I did.	0
And I brought it to the floor of the Senate.	0
Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans.	0
We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn't get the 60 votes that I needed.	0
That is pathetic.	0
This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.	0
So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.	0
What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise.	0
I did work with John McCain.	0
I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House.	0
And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A.	0
health care bill in the modern history of this country.	0
Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers.	0
The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s.	0
Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.	0
The last point that I'd make.	0
I had a hearing.	0
I had all of the veterans groups in front of me.	0
And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?	0
Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good.	0
We've got to strengthen the V.A.	0
We do not privatize the V.A.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, we're going to take another break.	0
We'll be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
And we are back.	0
We're gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit.	0
Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Monday's Iowa caucuses—narrowest of margins.	0
"Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, ""what happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period."	0
"The results were too close not to do a complete audit."""	0
Senator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa?	0
And do you—or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?	0
Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let's not blow this out of proportion.	0
This is not a—this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.	0
I think where we now stand—correct me if I'm wrong—you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates.	0
We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.	0
[ laughter ]	0
You know, so this is not—this is not the biggest deal in the world.	0
We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.	0
What the Des Moines Register said—you know, there were coin—I think there were half a dozen coin flips—a fairly chaotic type situation.	0
At the end of the day, no matter how it's recounted, it will break roughly even.	0
And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa.	0
See, and I don't have to say it, because they voted already.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven't voted, but...	0
[ applause ]	0
...but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion.	0
But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.	0
Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if that's what the party wants to do?	0
You good with that?	0
Whatever they decide to do, that's fine.	0
That's fair enough.	0
OK.	0
All right.	0
Good, we move on.	0
We're happy with that.	0
We have more questions.	0
Senator—Senator Sanders, in 1964...	0
Oh	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
[ laughter ]	0
See, when you are old, then they go back all these years.	0
All right.	0
What have you got?	0
In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement.	0
He was, however, far to the right of most of that party.	0
In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his party's mainstream.	0
Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election.	0
Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election.	0
And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now.	0
We know that.	0
But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you're running right now to try to get the nomination?	0
Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process.	0
But let me just say this.	0
In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire.	0
For example, the last poll I saw—there may have been a new one—last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one.	0
There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.	0
These are polls.	0
Polls go up.	0
Polls go down.	0
But here's why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate.	0
Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.	0
Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression.	0
I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.	0
If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate.	0
We win governors' chairs up and down the line.	0
So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House.	0
With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?	0
I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I say that with great—with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running.	0
I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign.	0
I hope that I will be able to earn their support.	0
They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together.	0
But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election.	0
And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight.	0
I've been vetted.	0
There's hardly anything you don't know about me.	0
And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.	0
So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job.	0
I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans.	0
And I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much electability.	0
It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.	0
And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to.	0
And that's what I'm prepared to...	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
We'll stay on this issue.	0
We'll stay on this topic.	0
Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders' ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again they're worried about the emails issue, not because they don't believe your explanation, but because it's a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.	0
They see your numbers right now and they think it's the email issue as to why you're not polling very well.	0
So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn't going to blow up your candidacy if you're the nominee?	0
Absolutely I can.	0
You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that.	0
And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions.	0
They basically said yeah, didn't get her.	0
We tried.	0
That was all a political ploy.	0
Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts.	0
and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material.	0
They are retroactively classifying it.	0
I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity.	0
And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity.	0
I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open—there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material.	0
Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?	0
I am 100 percent confident.	0
This is a security review that was requested.	0
It is being carried out.	0
It will be resolved.	0
But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me, there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.	0
Honest to goodness, this is—this just beggars the imagination.	0
So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here, and I hope that will happen.	0
Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didn't give a darn about her emails; I think you used another	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
[ off-mike ]	0
You're right.	0
I'm trying to—it's a—it's a family hour still right now.	0
After 11:00, I'll say it the other way.	0
And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well she's getting slapped with the email controversy.	0
Are you—how are you feeling about these darn emails now?	0
I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate.	0
There's a process under way.	0
I will not politicize it.	0
OK.	0
Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
And by the way—and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, thank you.	0
Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign.	0
You apologized for that when the incident was made public.	0
Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.	0
None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece.	0
Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?	0
Not losing control of our campaign.	0
You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.	0
In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper.	0
Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did.	0
So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not.	0
What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.	0
Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.	0
But that was only for—that was not to be on television.	0
That's an important point.	0
That was just something—as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.	0
Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue?	0
No.	0
And with that, we will	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates' debate.	0
Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer.	0
It's a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.	0
The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide.	0
Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?	0
Yes, I do.	0
And—you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.	0
I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism.	0
I have strong feelings about that.	0
I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.	0
I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it.	0
If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.	0
Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clinton's support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...	0
... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are—all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes.	0
It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.	0
Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty.	0
That's number one.	0
We have to be very careful about making sure about that.	0
But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there.	0
But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing.	0
So, when somebody commits...	0
[ applause ]	0
...somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key.	0
They're never going to get out.	0
But, I just don't' want to see government be part of killing.	0
That's all.	0
[ applause ]	0
Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states.	0
I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan.	0
On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it.	0
You have both been outspoken on that.	0
The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it.	0
There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today.	0
Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today.	0
If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?	0
Absolutely.	0
Absolutely.	0
You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before.	0
I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall.	0
I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.	0
This is an emergency.	0
Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life.	0
I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.	0
I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient.	0
We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring.	0
That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan.	0
If Michigan won't do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing?	0
President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?	0
Absolutely.	0
I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.	0
You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day.	0
In fact, I think I never have in my life.	0
But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...	0
[ applause ]	0
...was so outrageous.	0
What we are talking about are children being poisoned.	0
That's what we're talking about.	0
We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted.	0
We don't know how many thousands.	0
The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension.	0
And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.	0
And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.	0
Last point on this.	0
And I suspect the secretary agrees.	0
One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.	0
[ applause ]	0
Flint, Michigan, is a poor community.	0
It is disproportionately African-American and minority.	0
And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade.	0
In the '90s you supported NAFTA.	0
But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008.	0
As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then—which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.	0
If elected, should Democrats expect that once you're in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?	0
You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator.	0
And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.	0
I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements.	0
And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.	0
I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration.	1
Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.	0
Now I have a very clear view about this.	0
We have to trade with the rest of the world.	0
We are 5 percent of the world's population.	0
We have to trade with the other 95 percent.	0
And trade has to be reciprocal.	0
That's the way the global economy works.	0
But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy.	0
So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.	0
I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea.	0
We go the UAW on board because of changes we made.	0
So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.	0
Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you've been in Congress.	0
Absolutely right.	0
But if you do that as president...	0
[ applause ]	0
If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?	0
Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade.	0
I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.	0
I was not only in opposition to NAFTA—and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements.	0
I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood—I don't think this is really rocket science.	0
We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created.	0
I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.	0
I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour.	0
I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.	0
So, do I believe in trade?	0
Of course, I believe in trade.	0
"But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay?"	0
"We're going to China."""	0
Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages.	1
Trade is one of the reasons for that.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Thank you both.	0
We're going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we'll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing.	0
We'll be right back.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
All right.	0
Welcome back here in the final minutes.	0
The home stretch.	0
The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.	0
Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question.	0
Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half.	0
You're going to have to make choices.	0
And there's a lot of heavy lifts.	0
And he made choices.	0
He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform.	0
Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn't.	0
So there are three big lifts that you've talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change.	0
What do you do first?	0
Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.	0
Well, I—I don't accept that premise, Chuck.	0
I think that we've got so much business we have to do.	0
We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against—we're against income inequality.	0
We're against the abuses of powerful interests.	0
We're against a lot of things.	0
I'm for a lot of things.	0
I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening.	0
And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.	0
I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.	0
[ applause ]	0
I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years.	0
I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.	0
I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.	0
[ applause ]	0
Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses.	0
I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces—because that's the way Congress is set up.	0
You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.	0
Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure—we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.	0
All right, but Senator Sanders...	0
[ applause ]	0
...you've still got to do something first.	0
As you know, history said—shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.	0
No, let...	0
Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.	0
...	0
I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows.	0
All right?	0
We got to do that.	0
[ applause ]	0
But you miss—when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important.	0
And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.	0
[ applause ]	0
So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families.	0
So let me be very clear.	0
No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.	0
[ applause ]	0
Second point—second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country—largely African-American and Latino—the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.	0
No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell.	0
"Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, ""Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class."	0
"Start listening to working families."""	0
And as president, that's what I will work hard on.	0
[ applause ]	0
OK.	0
Thank you.	0
Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government—which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president.	0
The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops—is—is there a department of government that you would get rid of?	0
Or is there a whole new one that you would create?	0
The answer to both of those is no.	0
I'm interested in making what we have work better.	0
I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant.	0
I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work.	0
I have had the opportunity to run a big agency.	0
I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better—better than anybody had run it in a long time.	0
So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.	0
"And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say ""I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do."	0
But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do.	0
And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it.	0
We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.	0
But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry.	0
So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows—	0
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
—it will actually raise wages.	0
You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way.	0
That's what I want to do.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these.	0
Secretary Clinton, you've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see—	0
I never said that.	0
But do you see—do you see a vice president?	0
[ laughter ]	0
Look...	0
Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?	0
Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not—I'm not getting ahead of myself.	0
I think that would be a little bit presumptuous.	0
If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator, would you consider the secretary?	0
I agree with what the secretary said.	0
We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves.	0
And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand.	0
I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual.	0
And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.	0
[ applause ]	0
That's true.	0
That's true.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Secretary Clinton, closing statements.	0
You are first.	0
Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary.	0
I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.	0
You know, we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities.	0
Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.	0
So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
I—my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland.	0
Didn't have any money, couldn't speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.	0
I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money.	0
But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people, that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.	0
We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth.	0
We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.	0
I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.	0
I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.	0
Thank you all.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, there you have it.	0
I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just don't have any more time, unless we could	0
[ inaudible ]	0
a third hour, but I don't think so.	0
Our debate coverage—[	0
inaudible ] debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.	0
We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire.	0
You guys get to vote in just five days.	0
I can't wait to see how it turns out.	0
Don't screw up.	0
We'll see you in a few minutes.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
I do want to talk to you about the 100 days.	0
Good.	0
I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview. Did you see Aya	0
[Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years]	0
...	0
Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about?	0
No, just -- you know, I asked the government to let her out...	0
You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.	0
How did you hear about this story?	0
Many people, human rights people, are talking about it.	0
It's an incredible thing, especially when you meet her.	0
You realize -- I mean, she was in a rough place. Did you have to strike a deal with	0
[Abdel-Fattah]	0
el-Sissi over this?	0
No.	0
No deal.	0
He was here.	0
"He -- I said, ""I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out."""	0
And as you know, she went through a trial.	0
And anyway, she was let go.	0
And not only she, it was a total of eight people... Yeah, it's funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with	0
[Angela]	0
Merkel.	0
[Crosstalk	0
Really?	0
Chancellor Merkel.	0
"And I guess somebody shouted out, ""Shake her hand, shake her hand,"" you know."	0
But I never heard it.	0
But I had already shaken her hand four times.	0
You know, because we were together for a long time.	0
Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?	0
No.	0
Because, um, I'm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I'm at odds on immigration.	0
We had unbelievable chemistry.	0
And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi...	0
So it was a great thing to see that happen.	0
Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?	0
I think the 100 days is, you know, it's an artificial barrier.	0
It's not very meaningful.	0
I think I've established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I'm here.	0
I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I've established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown.	0
Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they've never seen anything like what's going on right now.	0
I really liked him a lot.	0
I think he liked me.	0
We have a great chemistry together...	0
I've developed great relationships with all of these leaders.	0
Nobody's written that.	0
"In fact, they said, ""Oh, well, he's not treating them nicely,"" because on NATO, I want them to pay up."	0
But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up.	0
"In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, ""Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up."""	0
He'll pay.	0
Did he say that?	0
In your meeting?	0
Your private meeting?	0
He's going to end up paying.	0
But you know, nobody ever asked the question.	0
Nobody asked.	0
Nobody ever asked him to pay up.	0
So it's a different kind of a presidency.	0
Do you feel like that's one thing that you've changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?	0
Yeah.	0
Let me give me an example.	0
A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet.	0
It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.	0
It was seven years behind schedule.	0
It was a disaster.	0
"So I called in Lockheed and I said, ""I'm sorry, we're going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,"" or whoever else."	0
But Boeing.	0
And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth...	0
I saved $725 million on the 90 planes.	1
Just 90.	0
Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered.	0
On 90 planes I saved $725 million.	0
It's actually a little bit more than that, but it's $725 million.	0
"Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, ""I've never seen anything like this in my life."""	0
We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut.	0
And the reason they cut -- same planes, same everything -- was because of me.	0
I mean, because that's what I do.	0
Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes.	0
In fact, when the Prime Minister Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those...	0
"The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, ""Could I thank you?"""	0
"I said, ""What?"""	0
"He said, ""You saved us $100 million."""	0
Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they bought.	0
Nobody wrote that story.	0
Now you know that's a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of -- it's between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order.	0
But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.	0
And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?	0
More.	0
I'm gonna get more than that.	0
This was a thing that was out of control and now it's great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn	0
[Hewson]	0
, she was great.	0
But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing.	0
You know?	0
Do you feel like you've been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?	0
I have great relationships with Congress.	0
I think we're doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things.	0
We're going to be applying, I shouldn't tell you this, but we're going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform.	0
And it's -- we've worked on it long and hard.	0
And you've got to understand, I've only been here now 93 days, 92 days.	0
President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare.	0
I've been here 92 days but I've only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right?	0
Health care started after 30 day, so I've been working on health care for 60 days...You know, we're very close.	0
And it's a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.	0
Is it this deal that's between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you're looking at?	0
So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people.	0
They're great people.	0
But some are moderate, some are very conservative.	0
The Democrats don't seem to have that nearly as much.	0
You know the Democrats have, they don't have that.	0
The Republicans do have that.	0
And I think it's fine.	0
But you know there's a pretty vast area in there.	0
And I have a great relationship with all of them.	0
Now, we have government not closing.	0
I think we'll be in great shape on that.	0
It's going very well.	0
Obviously, that takes precedent.	0
That takes precedent over health care?	0
For next week?	0
Yeah, sure.	0
Next week.	0
Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier.	0
The press keeps talking about the hundred days.	0
But we've done a lot.	0
You have a list of things.	0
I don't have to read it.	0
You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan.	0
Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?	0
Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan.	0
But yeah.	0
Well, I'm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I'll talk to you ...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
But things change.	0
There has to be flexibility.	0
Let me give you an example.	0
President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship.	0
"For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, ""By the way, I'd like you to solve the North Korean problem,"" doesn't work."	0
So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One.	0
Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it's a very exact thing.	0
It's not like generalities.	0
Do you want a Coke or anything?	0
I'm OK, thank you.	0
No...	0
But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators.	0
Because there's a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever.	0
"But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, ""By the way, would you help us with North Korea?"	0
"And also, you're a currency manipulator."""	0
It doesn't work that way.	0
Right.	0
And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness.	0
But you know some of them either don't get it, in which case they're very stupid people, or they just don't want to say it.	0
"You know because of a couple of them said, ""He didn't call them a currency manipulator."""	0
Well, for two reasons.	0
Number One, he's not, since my time.	0
You know, very specific formula.	0
You would think it's like generalities, it's not.	0
They have -- they've actually -- their currency's gone up.	0
So it's a very, very specific formula.	0
"And I said, ""How badly have they been,""... they said, ""Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency."""	0
That's Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea.	0
Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't.	0
Can you imagine?	0
...	0
So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?	0
No, because much of the foundation's been laid.	0
Things came up.	0
I'll give you an example.	0
I didn't put Supreme Court judge on the 100 day plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.	0
I think it's on there.	0
I don't know...	0
Begin the process of selecting.	0
You actually exceeded on this one.	0
"This says, ""Begin the process of selecting a replacement."""	0
That's the biggest thing I've done.	0
Do you consider that your biggest success?	0
Well, I -- first of all I think he's a great man.	0
I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court.	0
I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do.	0
Don't forget, he could be there for 40 years....	0
He's a young man.	0
I've always heard that that's the biggest thing.	0
Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing.	0
You know, to be honest, there are a number of things.	0
But I've always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice.	0
I've done one in my first 70 days.	0
Our military is so proud.	0
They were not proud at all.	0
They had their heads down.	0
Now they have their heads up...	0
I'm rebuilding the military.	0
We have great people.	0
We have great things in place.	0
We have tremendous borders.	0
I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million -- look at that, that's a massive amount of money.	0
"And I'll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes -- Gen. Mattis said, ""I've never seen anything like this,"" because he had to sign the ultimate"	0
[Inaudible]	0
...	0
He had to sign the ultimate, you know.	0
"He said, ""I've never seen anything like this before, as long as I've been in the military."""	0
You know, that kind of cutting.	0
Right. Now, if I can do that	0
[Inaudible]	0
... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget.	0
That won't happen.	0
Is that something you're going to take on?	0
[Inaudible]	0
But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive...	0
Can I ask you, over your first 100 days -- you're not quite there yet -- how do you feel like the office has changed you?	0
Well the one thing I would say -- and I say this to people -- I never realized how big it was. Everything's so	0
[Inaudible]	0
like, you know the orders are so massive.	0
I was talking to --	0
You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean --	0
Number One, there's great responsibility.	0
When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria.	0
"I'm saying to myself, ""You know, this is more than just like, 79 missiles."	0
"This is death that's involved,"" because people could have been killed."	0
This is risk that's involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area -- you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away -- and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you'd normally make.	0
[Inaudible]	0
...	0
This is involving death and life and so many things....	0
So it's far more responsibility.	0
[Inaudible]	0
....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency.	0
This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world.	0
The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department.	0
The third-largest company in the world is Social Security.	0
The fourth-largest -- you know, you go down the list.	0
Right.	0
It's massive.	0
And every agency is, like, bigger than any company.	0
So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility.	0
And the human responsibility.	0
You know, the human life that's involved in some of the decisions.	0
You've talked a little bit about the way that you've brought some business skills into the office.	0
Is there anything from your business background that just doesn't translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job?	0
Well in business, you don't necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people.	0
So if you're talking about health care -- you have health care in business but you're trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera.	0
You're providing health. This is	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don't involve heart.	0
What's that switch been like for you?	0
In fact, in business you're actually better off without it.	0
What's making that switch been like for you?	0
You have to love people.	0
And if you love people, such a big responsibility.	0
[Inaudible]	0
You can take any single thing, including even taxes.	0
I mean we're going to be doing major tax reform. Here's part of your story, it's going to be a big	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
"Everybody's saying, ""Oh, he's delaying."""	0
I'm not delaying anything. I'll tell you the other thing is	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
I used to get great press.	0
I get the worst press.	0
I get such dishonest reporting with the media.	0
That's another thing that really has -- I've never had anything like it before.	0
"It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, ""Well the one thing good is now I'll get good press."""	0
And it got worse.	0
[Inaudible]	0
So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me.	0
I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.	0
But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week?	0
Well I'm going to roll probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we're putting out a massive tax reform -- business and for people -- we want to do both. We've been working on it	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful	0
[Inaudible]	0
.... We're going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case	0
[Inaudible]	0
.... And that's a big story, because a lot of people think I'm going to put it out much later.	0
Do you have any details on that in terms of rates?	0
Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut.	0
It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever.	0
Maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had...	0
Obviously, that's going to come in a week where you're going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open.	0
If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it?	0
I don't know yet.	0
People want the border wall.	0
My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it -- you've been to many of the rallies.	0
OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall.	0
My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent.	0
You know, it's funny.	0
The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college.	0
Big, big, big advantage.	0
I've always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college -- but it's a whole different campaign	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it.	0
They want to see the wall, they want to see security.	0
Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down.... That's a tremendous achievement.... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower.	0
Now, people aren't coming because they know they're not going to get through, and there isn't crime.	0
You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that?	0
[Unintelligible]	0
Now, much of that's stopped because they can't get through.	0
It sounds like maybe you're beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn't have border funding in there, you would sign it.	0
Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I'm seeing.	0
I'm seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.	0
What do you think the estimate on it would be?	0
Oh I'm seeing numbers -- $24 billion, I think I'll do it for $10 billion or less.	0
That's not a lot of money relative to what we're talking about.	0
If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in -- and we'll stop all of it.	0
But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall -- they're coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can't do it because it's a real wall.	0
That's a tremendously good investment, 1 percent.	0
The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable.	0
We're becoming a drug culture, there's so much.	0
And most of it's coming from the southern border.	0
The wall will stop the drugs.	0
But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn't have --	0
I don't want to comment.	0
I just don't know yet.	0
I mean, I have to see what's going on.	0
I really do.	0
But the wall's a very important thing to -- not only my base, but to the people.	0
And even if it wasn't, I mean I'll do things that aren't necessarily popular....	0
The wall is very important to stopping drugs.	0
If you don't have a funding stream, your message to your base is what?	0
My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall's getting built, OK?	0
One hundred percent.	0
One hundred percent it's getting built.	0
And it's also getting built for much less money -- I hope you get this -- than these people are estimating.	0
The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall.	0
It's not going to cost anywhere near that.	0
You think $10 billion or less.	0
I think $10 billion or less.	0
And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more.	0
But it's not going to be anywhere near those kind of numbers.	0
And they're using those numbers; they're using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable.	0
And the fact it's going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.	0
[Interview goes off the record]	0
They had a quote from me that NATO's obsolete.	0
But they didn't say why it was obsolete.	0
I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn't in government.	0
People don't go around asking about NATO if I'm building a building in Manhattan, right?	0
So they asked me, Wolf... asked me about NATO, and I said two things.	0
"NATO's obsolete -- not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO -- NATO is obsolete, and I said, ""And the reason it's obsolete is because of the fact they don't focus on terrorism."""	0
You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.	0
What specifically has NATO changed?	0
[Citing Wall Street Journal Article]	0
...	0
I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete -- I said two things -- obsolete, and the country's aren't paying.	0
I was right about both.	0
I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO.	0
I took heat like you wouldn't believe.	0
"And then some expert on NATO said, ""You know, Trump is right."""	0
But I said it was obsolete because they weren't focused on terror...	0
It's not fair that we're paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they're supposed to be paying 2 percent.	0
"And I'm very strong on it and I'm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month."""	0
This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election.	0
What did you mean by that?	0
Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.	0
Do you think it's going to help Marine Le Pen?	0
I think so.	0
Do you believe that she should be the president?	0
No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it'll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what's been going on in France.	0
Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to --.	0
No.	0
Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win.	0
I am no different than you, you could say the same thing...	0
I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ...	0
No, I am no different than -- no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages.	0
I think what we've done on the border discourages it.	0
I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism.	0
I'm not going to have it in this country.	0
I'm not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here.	0
And it's already largely, you know -- we have tens -- we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here.	0
They shouldn't be here.	0
We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever.	0
They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country.	0
It's a big mistake.	0
Just so that I am clear.	0
You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are --	0
I am not endorsing her and I didn't mention her name.	0
Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear.	0
I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election.	0
I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know.	0
Right now, she is in second place.	0
I have a question on the markets, actually.	0
One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress.	0
Do you worry, though -- I mean, the markets go up and down.	0
You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent.	0
But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since.	1
Five hundred thousand.... As an example, Ford, General Motors.	0
"I've had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma, he comes up, he says, ""Only because of you am I making this massive investment."""	0
Intel, only because of you....	0
The press never writes that.	0
What about NAFTA?	0
What's the plan on NAFTA?	0
What would you like to know?	0
I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.	0
I am very upset with NAFTA.	0
I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States.	0
It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico.	0
Most people don't even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada.	0
You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.	0
Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?	0
I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.	0
Termination is still on the table.	0
Absolutely.	0
If they don't treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.	0
What's a timeline for that decision?	0
It's a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it's a six-month clause.	0
If I could fit a couple of more topics.	0
Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority.	0
You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails.	0
Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States?	0
When Wikileaks came out... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it.	1
"When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, ""Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff."""	0
You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses.	0
They didn't have defenses, which is pretty bad management.	0
But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them.	0
They weren't able to get through to Republicans.	0
"No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, ""Wow."""	0
It was just a figure of speech.	0
"I said, ""Well, look at this."	0
"It's good reading."""	0
But that didn't mean that you supported what Assange is doing?	0
No, I don't support or unsupport.	0
It was just information.	0
They shouldn't have allowed it to get out.	0
If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn't even allow the FBI.	0
How about this -- they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won't let the FBI see their server.	0
But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn't	0
[John]	0
Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server?	0
They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.	0
CrowdStrike?	0
That's what I heard.	0
I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard.	0
But they brought in another company to investigate the server.	0
Why didn't they allow the FBI in to investigate the server?	0
I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about.	0
It's incredible.	0
Can I just ask you, though -- do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange?	0
I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it's OK with me.	0
I didn't know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it's OK with me.	0
On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign --	0
And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers...	0
On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail.	0
And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement.	0
When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region?	0
In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.	0
So you believe that they are complying with the agreement?	0
No, I don't say that.	0
I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement.	0
There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.	0
In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East?	0
In terms of what they are doing of all over.	0
When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal?	0
Do they want you to stay in that deal?	0
I don't talk to them about it.	0
You don't talk to them about the Iran deal?	0
I mention it, but it's very personal when I talk to them, you know, it's confidential.	0
No, they have their own opinions.	0
I don't say that they are different than my opinions, but I'd rather have you ask them that question.	0
At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal?	0
It's possible that we won't.	0
Dreamers, you've talked about them, you've talked about heart earlier.	0
This is one area where you have talked --	0
No, we aren't looking to do anything right now.	0
Look, the dreamers... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he's got some problems, it's a little different than the dreamer case, right?	0
But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country.	0
They've taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that's what we should be.	0
They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference.	0
So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after.	0
We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.	0
And that's going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?	0
Yes.	0
Yes.	0
That's our policy.	0
I am not saying... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem.	0
But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. Kelly, now Secretary Kelly.	0
We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun.	0
They are being thrown in jails and they are being... all over the country and nobody's ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that.	0
We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that's probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth...	0
A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you.	0
I don't want to give them the wrong message with this.	0
Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy.	0
OK?	0
I'll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy...	0
[An aide talks about Trump's address to Congress]	0
A lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber.	0
You seem like you enjoyed it.	0
I did.	0
I did.	0
I believed in it and I enjoyed it.	0
It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information.	0
Have you seen the tremendous success?...	0
That's another thing that nobody talks about.	0
Have you seen the tremendous success we've had in the Middle East with the ISIS? When	0
[Haider al]	0
Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years.... We have had tremendous success, but we don't talk about it.	0
We don't talk about it.	0
Do you mean you don't talk about it personally because you don't want to talk about it?	0
I don't talk about it.	0
No.	0
And the generals don't talk about it.	0
You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days.	0
I know they have sent that over.	0
Have you accepted a plan?	0
Are you moving forward on a strategy?	0
We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.	0
So you have decided on a plan?	0
Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
Mosul.	0
Four months we are going in, three months.	0
We are still fighting Mosul.	0
You know why?	0
Because they were prepared.	0
If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.	0
Can you say generally what the strategy is?	0
Should people --	0
Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS.	0
We have no choice.	0
And other terrorist organizations.	0
Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS?	0
No, not much.	0
In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals --	0
Well, they've also accepted my strategy.	0
Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like?	0
Not many.	0
So a small increase?	0
It could be an increase, then an increase.	0
But not many more.	0
I want to do the job, but not many more....	0
This is an important story.	0
I've done a lot.	0
I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier.	1
And I'm scheduled... the foundations have been set to do some great things.	0
With foreign countries.	0
Look at, look at President Xi.	0
I mean ...	0
What do you think it was about your chemistry?	0
We had good chemistry.	0
Now I don't know that I think that's going to produce results but you've got a good chance.	0
Uh-huh.	0
Look, he turned down many coal ships.	0
These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income.	0
They're coming into China and they're being turned away.	0
That's never happened before.	0
The fuel, the oil, so many different things.	0
You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera.	0
People have said they've never seen this ever before in China.	0
We have the same relationship with others.	0
There's a great foundation that's built.	0
Great foundation.	0
And I think it's going to produce tremendous results for our country.	0
One more 100 days question.	0
That's fine.	0
... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days?	0
Yes.	0
I think my team has been, well, I have different teams.	0
I think my military team has been treated with great respect.	0
As they should be.	0
I think my other team hasn't been treated with the respect that they should get.	0
We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.	0
Do you mean your White House team when you say that?	0
Yeah, my White House team.	0
I think Reince has been doing an excellent job.	0
I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me.	0
Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them.	0
You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is.	0
If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California.	0
It's just the registration, there's nothing you can do.	0
So you're losing the two biggest states, that's where you start.	0
OK.	0
The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it's very, very hard.	0
Look at Obama's number in the Electoral College.	0
His numbers on the win were... but the Electoral College numbers were massive.	0
You lose New York, you lose Illinois.	0
Illinois is impossible to win.	0
And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California.	0
Right.	0
And you say, man.	0
Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina.	0
You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.	0
Right.	0
So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent.	0
Hundreds of millions... Yeah.	0
Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion.	0
But whatever.	0
She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost.	0
Solidly lost, because you know it wasn't 270, it was 306.	0
So there's anger.	0
But there was massive anger before I got there, so it's not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes.	0
I mean, here's a judge who is No.	0
1 at Columbia, No.	0
1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar.	0
And he got three votes.	0
Three Democratic votes, but yeah.	0
Three Democratic votes.	0
OK.	0
He's an Oxford scholar at the highest level.	0
The No.	0
1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers.	0
No bad decisions with all... nothing.	0
He's like a ...	0
Do you think that you can break through that?	0
I mean this --	0
Yeah, I do.	0
Is one of the biggest challenges for a president.	0
I think I can to an extent.	0
But there's a, there's a basic hard-line core that you can't break though, OK, that you can't break through.	0
There's a hard-line group you can't break through, you can't.	0
It's sad.	0
You can't.	0
Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot.	0
Elijah Cummings.	0
I really liked him a lot.	0
And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices.	0
He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous.	0
And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that.	0
He said you will be the greatest president.	0
He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.	0
He disputed that slightly.	0
That's what he said.	0
I mean, what can I tell you?	0
Yeah.	0
There's six people sitting here.	0
What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?	0
He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then --	0
Well he said, you'll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I'll take that also, but that you could be.	0
But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other.	0
In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that.	0
Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here.	0
It's incredible.	0
I watched him interviewed a week later and it's like he was never in my office.	0
And you can even say that.	0
And that's one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it's hard to actually change how people vote or change how people --	0
No I have, it's interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings.	0
I definitely.	0
You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it's the highest in the history of the show.	0
I have all the ratings for all those morning shows.	0
When I go, they go double, triple.	0
Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning.	0
I remember, right.	0
It had 9.2 million people.	0
It's the highest they've ever had. On any, on air,	0
[John]	0
Dickerson had 5.2 million people.	0
"It's the highest for ""Face the Nation"" or as I call it, ""Deface the Nation."""	0
"It's the highest for ""Deface the Nation"" since the World Trade Center."	0
Since the World Trade Center came down.	0
It's a tremendous advantage.	0
I have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that's what I call it, the fake media.	0
And the fake media is not all of the media.	0
You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no.	0
The fake media is some of you.	0
I could tell you who it is, 100 percent.	0
Sometimes you're fake, but -- but the fake media is some of the media.	0
It bears no relationship to the truth.	0
It's not that Fox treats me well, it's that Fox is the most accurate.	0
Do you believe that?	0
That Fox --	0
I do.	0
I get treated so badly.	0
Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it's a terrorism... it may be.	0
"I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, ""He called it a terrorist attack."""	0
They thought it was a bank robbery.	0
By the way, I'm 10-0 for that.	0
I've called every one of them.	0
Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I'm... Whatever.	0
Whatever.	0
In the meantime, I'm here and they're not.	0
Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there's such real-time reaction with everything you say?	0
Yeah.	0
Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision?	0
The one thing --	0
That you have to do --	0
OK.	0
The one thing I've learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do.	0
I don't watch CNN anymore.	0
You just said you did.	0
No. No, I, if I'm passing it, what did I just say	0
[Inaudible]	0
?	0
You just said --	0
Where?	0
Where?	0
Two minutes ago.	0
No, they treat me so badly.	0
No, I just said that.	0
No, I, what'd I say, I stopped watching them.	0
But I don't watch CNN anymore.	0
I don't watch MSNBC.	0
I don't watch it.	0
Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what's going on.	0
Right.	0
In fact, they also did.	0
I never thought I had the ability to not watch.	0
"Like, people think I watch ""Morning Joe."""	0
"I don't watch ""Morning Joe."""	0
I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game.	0
I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it's about me.	0
Or pleasant.	0
But when I see it's such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I've developed an ability that I never thought I had.	0
I don't watch things that are unpleasant.	0
I just don't watch them.	0
And do you feel like that's, that's because of the office that you now occupy --	0
No.	0
That you've made that change?	0
I don't know why it is, but I've developed that ability, and it's happened over the last, over the last year.	0
That's interesting.	0
And I don't watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant.	0
CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don't watch them anymore.	0
A lot of people don't watch them anymore, they're now in third place.	0
But I've created something where people are watching... but I don't watch CNN anymore.	0
I don't watch MSNBC anymore.	0
I don't watch things, and I never thought I had that ability.	0
I always thought I'd watch.	0
Sure.	0
I just don't.	0
And that's taken place over the last year.	0
And you know what that is, that's a great, it's a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you're, you don't watch this total negativity.	0
I never thought I'd be able to do that and for me, it's so easy to do now.	0
Just don't watch.	0
That's interesting.	0
Maybe it's because I'm here.	0
I don't know.	0
Good evening, and thank you.	0
We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.	0
We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided.	0
And tonight you're going to hear some of their questions for the candidates.	0
And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook.	0
We also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.	0
We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight.	0
This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face.	0
Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be.	0
You know you're watching — whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or neither — because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you.	0
And we believe that, too.	0
With that, let's welcome the candidates to the stage.	0
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.	0
[ applause ]	0
Welcome, Senator, great to see you.	0
And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.	0
[ applause ]	0
Very good to be here with you.	0
Thank you.	0
Welcome to you both.	0
Now, a word about format.	0
There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.	0
With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America's heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin.	0
Now let's turn to the candidates for their opening statements.	0
The order was decided by coin toss.	0
And, Senator Sanders, you go first.	0
Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event.	0
And, PBS, thank you.	0
Nine months ago, our campaign began.	0
And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.	0
A lot has happened in nine months.	0
And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.	0
And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.	0
And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.	0
They are worried to death about the future of their kids.	0
And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.	0
And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.	0
They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.	0
We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.	0
They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.	0
No criminal records for them.	0
I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.	0
They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
Secretary Clinton.	0
I'm running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind.	0
I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy.	0
And for good cause.	0
Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.	1
There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.	0
And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.	0
We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.	0
But I want to go further.	0
I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now.	0
African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system.	0
Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future.	0
Guaranteeing that women's work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve.	0
I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.	0
That will be my mission as president.	0
And I think together we will make progress.	0
Thank you both.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you both.	0
And we'll be right back after a short break to begin questions.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee.	0
Let's get right to the questions.	0
Senator Sanders, to you first.	0
Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they're asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government?	0
It's already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy.	0
How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?	0
Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.	0
In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going — getting poorer.	0
What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.	0
Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.	0
I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.	0
I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.	0
Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.	0
Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.	0
But, my question is how big would government be?	0
Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...	0
... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.	0
Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.	0
Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans — let's take healthcare for example.	0
Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.	0
Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.	0
This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.	0
Well, let us level with the American people.	0
Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.	0
I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.	0
We're not going to dismantle everything.	0
But, here is the truth.	0
Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.	0
We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.	1
One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.	0
Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.	0
What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle — the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.	0
In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.	0
[ applause ]	0
I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.	0
You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.	0
And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.	0
[ applause ]	0
And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment — namely the Affordable Care Act — is because I know how hard it was to get that done.	0
We are at 90 percent coverage.	0
We have to get the remaining 10.	0
I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.	0
And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.	0
But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.	0
If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.	0
The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.	0
So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.	0
And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.	0
Final thought, Senator.	0
That is absolutely inaccurate.	0
Look, here is the reality, folks.	0
There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.	0
There is one major country — the United States — which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.	0
Please do not tell me that in this country, if — and here's the if — we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.	0
Well, let me just — let me just say, once again...	0
[ applause ]	0
...that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.	0
I believe we are on the path to doing that.	0
The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.	0
And we are not England.	0
We are not France.	0
We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.	0
So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.	0
We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.	0
I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'd like to move along.	0
I'd like to move along.	0
Secretary Clinton, you might — you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government.	0
"You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: ""The era of big government is over."""	0
You may remember that.	0
When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied.	0
Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?	0
No.	0
But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?	0
In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.	0
I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.	0
There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.	0
I'm aware of that.	0
It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.	0
So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.	0
But I haven't heard either of you put a price tag on your — you say...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I will put a price tag.	0
My price tag is about $100 billion a year.	0
And again, paid for.	0
And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.	0
I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.	0
And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.	0
But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.	0
Senator?	0
Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.	0
And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.	0
For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?	0
Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?	0
Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?	0
Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.	0
We need to create jobs.	0
So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.	0
Yes, I'm going to do away with that.	0
We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.	0
Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession — Great Depression.	0
Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.	0
We bailed them out.	0
Now it is their time to help the middle class.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.	0
And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.	0
We differ, however, on a couple of key points.	0
One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.	0
And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.	0
I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Next, we're going to...	0
A brief response.	0
Very brief, thank you.	0
Here is where we are with public education.	0
A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.	0
Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.	0
And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.	0
The world has changed.	0
This is 2016.	0
In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.	0
So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.	0
That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, your campaign — you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters.	0
You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president.	0
But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders.	0
What are women missing about you?	0
Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.	0
I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.	0
And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.	0
So I'm going to keep making that case.	0
I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.	0
But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.	0
I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.	0
That's what I'm working towards.	0
[ applause ]	0
As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there's a special place in Hell for women who don't support other women.	0
Do you agree with what she said?	0
Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.	0
But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.	0
That's what I've always stood for.	0
And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.	0
I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.	0
So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, you're in the minority, but we still want to hear from you.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.	0
We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.	0
I am very proud, if my memory is not correct — I think I am — that I have a lifetime — and I've been in Congress a few years — a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.	0
I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.	0
I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.	0
And we will join the rest of the other — the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?	0
Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, I have said — I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.	0
I'm asking people to support me because I think I'm the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander-in-chief.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.	0
And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.	0
I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.	0
I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.	0
Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.	0
So I'm asking women, I'm asking men, to support me because I'm ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges.	0
[ applause ]	0
Final comment.	0
Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.	0
And I will tell you something that really galls me.	0
I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.	0
Just a little bit.	0
All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.	0
Government is the enemy.	0
We're going to cut Social Security to help you.	0
We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.	0
But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.	0
If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you both.	0
We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook.	0
They were selected from a curated group of people we've been following of undecided voters.	0
The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin.	0
"And she writes: ""Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study."	0
They found that Wisconsin's incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country's rate.	0
"What can we do across the nation to address this?"""	0
Senator Sanders.	0
This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.	0
And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.	0
It has to be dealt with.	0
Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.	0
That is beyond unspeakable.	0
So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.	0
[ applause ]	0
What we have to do is end over-policing in African-American neighborhoods.	0
The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.	0
The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.	0
Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.	0
The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.	0
We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.	0
I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.	0
What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.	0
The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.	0
The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.	0
And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.	0
His family certainly believes that.	0
And so do I.	0
So we have work to do.	0
There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.	0
President Obama's policing commission came out with some.	0
I have fully endorsed those.	0
But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.	0
And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.	0
But, I would also add this.	0
There are other racial discrepancies.	0
Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.	0
So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.	0
[ applause ]	0
Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.	0
This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.	0
It takes away discretion from judges.	0
We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.	0
And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.	0
People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up — we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.	0
So, we have a lot of work to do.	0
But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.	0
When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.	0
Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.	0
We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example.	0
Hardly anyone believes that they have.	0
Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency?	0
What would you do that the nation's first African American has not been able to?	0
Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.	0
I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.	0
We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.	0
So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.	0
I think President Obama has set a great example.	0
I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.	0
Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.	0
We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.	0
We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.	0
I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.	0
But, we can't rest.	0
We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.	0
So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.	0
Nobody can deny them.	0
To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.	0
So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders?	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.	0
People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.	0
Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.	0
As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.	1
So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration — which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother — clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.	0
We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.	0
And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.	0
So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they've been?	0
Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.	0
We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.	0
And I think when you give low-income kids — African-American, white, Latino kids — the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.	0
They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color.	0
I want to talk about white people, OK?	0
White people?	0
I know.	0
[ laughter ]	0
So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country.	0
By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite.	0
Our public schools are already there.	0
If working-class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don't they have a reason to be resentful, Senator — Secretary Clinton?	0
Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.	0
People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.	0
This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.	0
And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.	0
You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?	0
Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?	0
And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.	0
I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has — the 10-20-30 proposal — to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.	0
And you know what?	0
If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.	0
So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans — particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have — you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.	0
And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator — Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to — am I wrong?	0
Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?	0
Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.	0
So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.	0
But it is a general economic issue.	0
And here's what the economic issue is.	0
The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.	0
Why is that?	0
Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.	0
But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.	0
Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.	0
But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.	0
You once had a pension.	0
Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.	0
They're off to China.	0
Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.	0
What have you got now?	0
You are working at McDonald's?	0
That is why there is massive despair all over this country.	0
People have worked their entire lives.	0
They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.	0
Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.	0
And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.	0
Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants.	0
President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits.	0
Would you go further than that?	0
And if so, how specifically would you do it?	0
Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?	0
The answer is yes.	0
We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.	0
I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.	0
I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.	0
I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.	0
I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.	0
And in fact I would go further.	0
What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.	0
And let me say this also.	0
Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.	0
And I would not support those.	0
Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.	0
[ applause ]	0
I strongly support the president's executive actions.	0
I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.	0
I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.	0
I am against the raids.	0
I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.	0
We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.	0
I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.	0
Have been ever since I was in the Senate.	0
I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.	0
I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.	0
Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.	0
Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.	0
And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.	0
Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.	0
And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.	0
If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.	0
That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.	0
In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.	0
I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.	0
Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.	0
So it wasn't just me who opposed it.	0
It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.	0
It was the AFL-CIO.	0
It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.	0
But we are where we are right now.	0
And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.	0
What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.	0
Two quick responses.	0
One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.	0
I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.	0
And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.	0
And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.	0
And I was proud to stand with him and support it.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'd like...	0
Well, let me just respond.	0
I worked with Ted Kennedy.	0
He was the chairman of my committee.	0
And I loved Ted Kennedy.	0
But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don't apologize for that vote.	0
But in terms of the children, I don't know to whom you're sending a message.	0
Who are you sending a message to?	0
These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake.	0
That was the fact.	0
I don't think we use them to send a message.	0
I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, that just wasn't — that just wasn't the fact, Senator.	0
The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.	0
So we have a disagreement on this.	0
I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.	0
[ applause ]	0
If you would allow me now to move on, we've been talking about children.	0
I want to talk about seniors.	0
"That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, ""My father"" — she's a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee."	0
"And she writes, ""My father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid's family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors."	0
"How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?"""	0
Start with you, Senator Sanders.	0
OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.	0
And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.	0
We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.	0
And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors — and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country — who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.	0
And you know what?	0
You do the arithmetic.	0
You can't get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year.	0
And here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference.	0
I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000.	0
[ applause ]	0
And when we — and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.	0
We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.	0
Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.	0
But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.	0
That is not what America should be about.	0
If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.	0
[ applause ]	0
I think — I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.	0
We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.	0
I've said I'm looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially.	0
First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs.	0
I want to take care of women.	0
When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked.	0
And women have been disadvantaged ever since.	0
They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities.	0
And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment.	0
So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program.	0
But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don't believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.	0
In all due respect...	0
[ applause ]	0
...In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question.	0
Are you coming onboard a proposal?	0
And what is that proposal?	0
Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008.	0
You opposed him then.	0
I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do.	0
We're asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity.	0
I hope you will make a decision soon on this.	0
Well, Senator, look, I think we're in vigorous agreement here.	0
We both want to get more revenue in.	0
I have yet to see a proposal that you're describing that the — raising the cap would apply to passive income.	0
That has not been...	0
That's my bill.	0
Check it out.	0
Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I've seen.	0
I'm interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it.	0
So I'm going to come up with the best way forward.	0
We're going to end up in the same place.	0
We're going to get more revenue.	0
I'm going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first.	0
[ applause ]	0
We're going to move on.	0
Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited.	0
But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.	0
You have said that there's no quid pro quo involved.	0
Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers?	0
I can't speak for the Koch Brothers, you're referring to a Super PAC that we don't coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me.	0
They are the ones who should respond to any questions.	0
Let's talk about our campaigns.	0
I'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions.	0
So, I'm proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters.	0
I think it's great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side.	0
That's the way it should be, and I'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is.	0
I think that is the real key here.	0
We both have a lot of small donors.	0
I think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the Republican side.	0
The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda.	0
It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country.	0
We're going to fight it as hard as we can, and we're going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'm asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors.	0
What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that's what we're talking about.	0
We have to be honest about it.	0
It is undermining American democracy.	0
When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK?	0
We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC?	0
And, we said no.	0
We don't represent Wall Street, we don't represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC.	0
But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something.	0
And, it turns out that up until — and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people.	0
Now, Secretary Clinton's Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street.	0
Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I'm very proud of that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, are you saying...	0
We are mixing apples and oranges.	0
My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations.	0
I'm very proud.	0
That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country.	0
But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me.	0
It's not my PAC.	0
If you take donations from Wall Street, you can't be independent.	0
I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever.	0
Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street.	0
He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930's.	0
So, let's not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it's Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the American people.	0
[ applause ]	0
The people aren't dumb.	0
Why in God's name does Wall Street...	0
[ applause ]	0
But let's not — but let's not — let's not insult — let's not insult the intelligence of the American people.	0
People aren't dumb.	0
Why in God's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions?	0
I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions?	0
Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?	0
Why does the fossil fuel industry pay — spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions?	0
Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system?	0
[ applause ]	0
And when we talk about Wall Street, let's talk about Wall Street.	0
I voted for Dodd-Frank, got an important amendment in it.	0
In my view, it doesn't go anywhere near far enough.	0
But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash.	0
No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, let's just — let's just follow up on this, because, you know, I've made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk.	0
I think that's a major accomplishment.	0
I agree, however, it doesn't go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason.	0
I go further in the plan that I've proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face.	0
It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse.	0
It was a big insurance company, AIG.	0
It was Countrywide Mortgage.	0
My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be.	0
And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective.	0
It goes in the right direction.	0
We have Dodd-Frank.	0
We can use it to break up the banks, if that's appropriate.	0
But let's not kid ourselves.	0
As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon.	0
I want to get ahead of those, and that's why I've proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these...[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
We have to go to a break.	0
We...	0
Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here.	0
When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up.	0
I think he would have been right.	0
I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation.	0
I think that would have been right, as well.	0
That's my view.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Thank you both.	0
It is time for a break.	0
And when we come back, we're going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe.	0
There's a lot more to come in just a few minutes.	0
Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate.	0
Before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group.	0
And it is to Senator Sanders.	0
Senator, it comes from Bill Corfield.	0
He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy, Ohio.	0
"And he asks: ""Are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?"""	0
Hey, I'm in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn't think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken.	0
I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.	0
How about you, Senator Clinton — Secretary Clinton?	0
Absolutely.	0
And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve.	0
There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities.	0
I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we're taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don't need anymore.	0
And that's what I intend to do.	0
If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited.	0
And I have the feeling you're going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities.	0
[ applause ]	0
We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity.	0
The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities.	0
And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about America's role in the world.	0
Americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here.	0
According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two-thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can't win.	0
They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready.	0
Are we?	0
Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be.	0
We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven't done enough.	0
So we have to go after this both abroad and at home.	0
We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS — that's not the only one, but let's focus on that for a minute.	0
We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS.	0
That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in.	0
We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi.	0
We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so.	0
And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters.	0
And we have to take on ISIS online.	0
They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence.	0
Here at home, we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement.	0
We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it's needed.	0
But the final thing I want to say about this is the following.	0
You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it.	0
And we need to do that throughout the country.	0
But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense.	0
They are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society.	0
So when somebody like Donald Trump and others...	0
[ applause ]	0
...stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home.	0
It's not only offensive; it's dangerous.	0
And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations.	0
I know how to do that.	0
I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program.	0
[ applause ]	0
And you don't go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion.	0
So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.	0
Senator Sanders...	0
Let me — let me just say this.	0
What a President of the United States has got to do and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility is to, a, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values, that we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity.	0
I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn't believe them.	0
And if you go to my Web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred.	0
Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change.	0
Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world.	0
And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator.	0
We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.	0
We got rid of Gadhafi.	0
But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it's to understand what happens the day after.	0
And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi.	0
But what happened is a political vacuum developed.	0
ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.	0
But this is nothing new.	0
This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments.	0
Mossadegh back in 1953.	0
Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran.	0
He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British.	0
And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator.	0
The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today.	0
Unintended consequences.	0
So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences.	0
I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.	0
[ applause ]	0
If I could just respond.	0
Two points.	0
One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein's regime.	0
He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on.	0
I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016.	0
It's very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in.	0
When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in-chief.	0
And it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them.	0
As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq.	0
And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state.	0
I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years.	0
[ applause ]	0
Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs.	0
Secretary of state for four years.	0
You've got a bit of experience, I would imagine.	0
But judgment matters as well.	0
Judgment matters as well.	0
And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq.	0
I lead the opposition against it.	0
She voted for it.	0
But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent.	0
Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.	0
That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.	0
You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on.	0
And, look, I think it's important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden.	0
I looked at the evidence.	0
I looked at the intelligence.	0
I got the briefings.	0
I recommended that the president go forward.	0
It was a hard choice.	0
Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that.	0
And at the end of the day, it was the president's decision.	0
So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision.	0
I'm proud that I gave him that advice.	0
And I'm very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission.	0
[ applause ]	0
Judy, one area very briefly...	0
Just a final word.	0
Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate — and I believe in her book — very good book, by the way — in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger.	0
Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend.	0
I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger.	0
And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.	0
So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.	0
Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.	0
That's for sure.	0
That's fine.	0
That's fine.	0
[ laughter ]	0
You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.	0
I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
So if we want to pick and choose — and I certainly do — people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.	0
It is.	0
And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
I find — I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.	0
Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.	0
Not everybody remembers that.	0
You do.	0
I do.	0
The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.	0
That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.	0
And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.	0
The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.	0
Not my kind of guy.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator, let me — let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that's Russia.	0
On the one hand, we're aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.	0
Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead — that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all — have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS.	0
So my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared — how hard are you prepared to be?	0
Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions?	0
Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe?	0
It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.	0
Well, this is what I would say.	0
It is a complicated relationship.	0
I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.	0
As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed — men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country — their own country — it is unspeakable.	0
It is a real horror.	0
Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.	0
But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO — correctly, I believe — are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.	0
I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.	0
But bottom line is: The president is right.	0
We have to put more money.	0
We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.	0
Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.	0
The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.	0
The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.	0
You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.	0
Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?	0
So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.	0
But I would add this.	0
You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.	0
At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.	0
This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.	0
We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.	0
This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.	0
Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.	0
Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.	0
So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.	0
And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.	0
So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.	0
So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me just — just say this.	0
For a start, the secretary and I disagree — and I think the president does not agree with her — in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.	0
I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.	0
I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.	0
Let's hope that it holds.	0
But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.	0
But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.	0
And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.	0
But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.	0
And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.	0
That's how you make peace in the world.	0
You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, I respectfully disagree.	0
I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.	0
That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.	0
I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.	0
Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.	0
Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.	0
Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.	0
They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.	0
They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.	0
We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have a lot of work to do.	0
We have a lot of work to do.	0
But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.	0
I have no illusion.	0
Of course you are right.	0
Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.	0
Everybody knows that.	0
But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...	0
Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said.	0
The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions?	0
I said no.	0
And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.	0
That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.	0
[ applause ]	0
No, I think the idea was that president — then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.	0
It's easier to talk to your friends.	0
It's harder to talk to your enemies.	0
I think we should do both.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me move on.	0
You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya.	0
More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015.	0
Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day.	0
Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean.	0
And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing.	0
If we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this?	0
What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.	0
And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.	0
With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.	0
And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.	0
in particular.	0
This is a humanitarian catastrophe.	0
There is no other description of it.	0
So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.	0
We have to stand with them.	0
We have to provide financial support to them.	0
We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.	0
And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.	0
A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.	0
And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.	0
And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.	0
And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.	0
It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.	0
That is not what America is supposed to be about.	0
So I believe that working with Europe — and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.	0
You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.	0
They have a responsibility, as well.	0
But I think this is a worldwide — that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.	0
[ applause ]	0
And we have a final question from our Facebook family.	0
And it goes to Senator Sanders.	0
It comes from Robert Andrews.	0
He's a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts.	0
"He says, ""The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history."	0
Can you name two leaders — one American and one foreign — who would influence your foreign policy decisions?	0
"And why do you see them as — why are they influential?"""	0
You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.	0
"And he stood before the American people and he said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression."	0
And then what he did is redefine the role of government.	0
You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.	0
So what if mass unemployment exists?	0
So what if children are going hungry?	0
That's not the role of the government.	0
"And when FDR said, ""Yeah, it is,"" that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish."	0
And kind of — that's what I see our campaign is about right now.	0
In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.	0
don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.	0
If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.	0
We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.	0
In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.	0
He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.	0
But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.	0
Those are two leaders that I admire very much.	0
[ applause ]	0
I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.	0
And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.	0
I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.	0
But I want to — I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.	0
And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.	0
In the past he has called him weak.	0
He has called him a disappointment.	1
He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.	0
And I just couldn't agree — disagree more with those kinds of comments.	0
You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...[	0
applause ]...who got us out of that...	0
[ applause ]	0
...put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future.	0
And it is a — the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.	0
I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.	0
That is...	0
[ applause ]	0
...Madam Secretary, that is a low blow.	0
I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years.	0
When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month.	0
We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.	0
And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.	0
As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.	0
[ applause ]	0
But you know what?	0
Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.	0
Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.	0
So I have voiced criticisms.	0
You're right.	0
Maybe you haven't.	0
I have.	0
But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?	0
The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.	0
That's what I said.	0
That is what I believe.	0
[ applause ]	0
President Obama and I are friends.	0
As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator.	0
I have worked for his re-election.	0
His first election and his re-election.	0
But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.	0
I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.	0
Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?	0
Have you ever disagreed with a president?	0
I suspect you may have.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.	0
As a senator, yes, I was a senator.	0
I understand we can disagree on the path forward.	0
But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.	0
Senator, if you would like respond to — you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.	0
Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama.	0
I was not that candidate.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right, look, this has been a great debate.	0
A lot of interesting issues have come together.	0
Let me conclude by just saying this.	0
There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.	0
This campaign is not just about electing a president.	0
What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don't think anybody hears their pains or their concerns.	0
Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it's like going to the moon.	0
It ain't going to happen.	0
Low income people who are not involved in the political process.	0
What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power.	0
Thank you all very much.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
You know, we — we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics.	0
We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again.	0
But here's the point I want to make tonight.	0
I am not a single-issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.	0
I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.	0
And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before...	0
[ applause ]	0
...the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues.	0
Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence?	0
You're right.	0
But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint.	0
We would still have racism holding people back.	0
We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay.	0
We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday.	0
And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions.	0
So I'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.	0

This Sunday, the Republican party coming apart.	0
It really looks like a massive victory.	0
Donald Trump wraps up the Republican nomination and effectively tells G.O.P.	0
"leaders, ""It's my party and you can cry if you want to."""	0
Our thing, it’s very simple, it’s make America great again.	0
My interview with the Republican party's presumptive nominee, Donald Trump.	0
Plus, it's a simple fact, divided parties lose elections.	0
"Republican voters embrace Trump, the Republican leadership says, ""No way."""	0
I'm just not ready to do that at this point.	0
Can Donald Trump become the first candidate in more than half a century to win an election without a united party behind him?	0
Also, don't look now, but the general election has already begun.	0
I can focus on Hillary.	0
Crooked Hillary.	0
He doesn't think much of equal pay for women because, of course, he doesn't think much of women.	0
Even S.N.L.	0
is looking towards November.	0
And now we've landed on the exciting presidential match-up between a godless, liberal Democrat and Hillary Clinton.	0
Joining me for insight and analysis this Sunday morning are Eugene Robinson, Pulitzer-Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post, Andrea Mitchell of NBC News, Matt Bai, national political correspondent for Yahoo News, and Republican strategist and pollster, Kellyanne Conway.	0
Welcome to Sunday.	0
It's Meet the Press.	0
From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.	0
Good Sunday morning, happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there watching.	0
This may well be this generation's defining moment in American politics, particularly for Republicans.	0
The Republican party splitting apart as it turns its back on its new presumptive nominee: Donald Trump.	0
What we're witnessing is nothing short of what you might call tissue rejection.	0
"Conservatives who warn that Trump would ultimately prove he's not one of them, are having their own, ""I told you so"" moment."	0
During the primaries, Trump said he was opposed to raising the minimum wage.	0
Now he says he's open to raising it.	0
During the primaries, Trump put out a plan lowering taxes on everybody, including the wealthy, now he says he's open to raising taxes for the wealthiest Americans.	0
And during the primaries, Trump insisted over and over again he would self-fund his campaign, and now he says he's building a world-class finance organization aimed at raising money for his campaign.	0
That, and so much more, has led a long parade of prominent Republicans to say either they can't support Trump or they have to think it over.	0
We'll get to my interview with Donald Trump in just a moment, but one thing is clear.	0
He begins his campaign as a the presumptive nominee of a party, whose leadership A) didn't want him, and B) is deeply reluctant to rally around him.	0
In short, is the Republican party wigging out?	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
I'm not there right now.	0
And I hope to though, and I want to.	0
But I think what is required is that we unify this party.	0
Donald Trump is facing a rejection from Republican party leaders that is unprecedented in modern politics.	0
I think Donald Trump's a kind of man.	0
I'm not going to support somebody I don't believe is a reliable Republican conservative.	0
"Nebraska senator Ben Sasse says, ""A third-party candidate is the only solution."""	0
"Quote, ""This is America."	0
"If both choices stink, we reject them and go bigger."""	0
The only two living Republican presidents, both Bushes, are also no's, refusing to endorse Trump and skipping the Republican Convention after a campaign of insults to Jeb.	0
He’s low energy.	0
Let's be sure.	0
The 2012 nominee, also a no, is being courted to run as an independent.	0
So far, Mitt Romney is not interested.	0
The 2008 nominee, with a primary in August, is a reluctant yes, but also staying away from Cleveland in July.	0
If there is a Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, I have no doubt that this may be the race of my life.	0
Even the chair of the convention is sending a signal to donors and voters that it's okay to stay on the bench.	0
I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee.	0
I didn't get Paul Ryan.	0
I don't know what happened.	0
I don't know.	0
All of a sudden, he wants to be cute.	0
But, you know, we'll see.	0
With a meeting planned in Washington next week, the chill could thaw.	0
And some Trump skeptics are coming around, including Rick Perry, who said this just months ago:	0
Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism.	0
But Trump begins the general election as a scarred candidate, trailing by 23 points among women, and leading by just three points among men.	0
He doesn't think much of equal pay for women because, of course, he doesn't think much of women, it turns out.	0
But for Trump, the attacks are going to be personal.	0
And she was a total enabler.	0
She would go after these women and destroy their lives.	0
I mean, have you ever read what Hillary Clinton did to the women that Bill Clinton had affairs with?	0
And they're going after me with women?	0
Give me a break, folks.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Yesterday I spoke with Mr. Trump.	0
And I began by asking if he was surprised to have already wrapped up the Republican nomination.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Well, I thought I'd do it.	0
I didn't know I was going to do it this early.	0
I assumed that Hillary would be watching me, as opposed to me watching Hillary.	0
So that's good.	0
And it's going to be an interesting things, because Bernie Sanders is not being treated fairly.	0
Not being treated fairly.	0
You know, it's a rigged system against him also.	0
I'm no Bernie fan, I can tell you that.	0
But it is a rigged system.	0
Do you believe the system is-- the Republican system was pretty rigged too, even though you're winning it?	0
Yeah, totally rigged.	0
It was totally rigged.	0
And it was only that I was winning by so much.	0
I was winning in landslides every week.	0
And if I weren't, I wouldn't have been able to do it, because it was dictated by the bosses.	0
But you know what, I'm happy with it.	0
It's like a boxer.	0
You have to go and you have to knock out the opponent.	0
We won so many landslide states, especially the last seven or eight, that you know, there was nothing much they could do about it.	0
But it's not a good system--	0
You know, you complained about the system a lot.	0
I'm curious, are you now more open to same-day voter registration, allowing independents to vote in any primary they want?	0
Are you going to be somebody that's going to advocate for those positions now, to make it easier to vote, since your voters had a hard time?	0
Well, you can't expand the party that way.	0
And you know, we've done it both ways.	0
I've always done better when independents could cross over, and frankly when Democrats could cross over.	0
You know, in New York when we were doing the voting, they interviewed -- a lot of people interviewed the people at the voting booths, that you know, manned the voting booths.	0
And they were saying that they've never seen anything like it--	0
Well, they banned same day-- you realize that in New York, had there been same day voter registration those people could have voted.	0
So are you for that?	0
Well, I'll tell you what.	0
But they said that they've never seen so many Democrats wanting to vote for Trump.	0
They were by the thousands.	0
And I will say this.	0
On Election Day, we're going to do very well in New York.	0
But the people were saying to the press that they'd never seen anything like it.	0
They've been there for 30 and 40 years doing this kind of stuff.	0
But you're not-- but I'm just curious--	0
--where Democrats are going over.	0
--do you want to see the voting laws changed to make it easier to vote?	0
I want to see voting laws so that people that are citizens can vote.	0
Not so people that can walk off the street and can vote, or so that illegal immigrants can vote--	0
So you're not for same-day voter registration?	0
No, no.	0
I want to make the voting laws so that people that-- it doesn't make any difference how they do it.	0
But I don't think people should sneak in through the cracks.	0
You have to have -- And whether that's an ID or any way you want to do it.	0
But you have to be a citizen to vote.	0
Well, of course.	0
That is the law as it stands already.	0
Let me ask--	0
No, it's not.	0
I mean, you have places where people just walk in and vote.	0
We don't have a lot of time.	0
I want to move on here.	0
Let me talk about the Paul Ryan situation.	0
Frankly, you seem pretty annoyed by this.	0
Are you?	0
No.	0
It's just the way it is.	0
I don't think it hurts me at all.	0
And I'd like to have his support, but if he doesn't want to support me that's fine.	0
And we have to go about it.	0
Look, I'm going to get millions and millions of votes more than the Republicans would have gotten.	0
If you look at the numbers, I think right now, or I will be this week or next week, in the history of the Republican Party, nobody has ever gotten so many votes as I have.	0
I've beaten Eisenhower and Nixon and Reagan and everybody.	0
And we have a tremendous group of people that's voting.	0
And remember, I have a lot of states left.	0
And if you look at the percentages I'm winning, I mean, I got 62 percent in New York, and I got these massive numbers all over.	0
And I have three candidates.	0
I was having to beat three candidates.	0
You know, nobody ever mentions that, that you get 62 percent, but it's not against just one person.	0
It's against, in this case, three.	0
And during the process--	0
"And so your case to Paul Ryan is, ""Hey, the voters have decided."	0
"Get on board."""	0
Well, I would say that's true.	0
I mean, to be honest.	0
I like Paul Ryan.	0
I think he's a very good guy.	0
He called me three weeks ago, and he was so supportive.	0
It was amazing.	0
And I never thought a thing like this.	0
I got blindsided by this--	0
So you're stunned.	0
You feel blindsided by him?	0
No, I would say stunned is a little bit-- it's politics.	0
I'm never stunned by anything that happens in politics.	0
But, so I’m not -- yeah, I was blindsided a little bit, because he spoke to me three weeks ago, and it was a very nice call, a very encouraging call.	0
I was doing well.	0
He called me, I think, to congratulate me about New York, 'cause I won by massive numbers.	0
I won everything.	0
And then the next week, I won the five states in a row by all landslide numbers.	0
And he called me to congratulate me.	0
Couldn't have been nicer.	0
And again, I have a nice relationship with him.	0
Don't know him well.	0
Met him one time.	0
But have a nice relationship with him.	0
And then all of a sudden, he gets on and he does this number.	0
So I'm not exactly sure what he has in mind.	0
But that's okay--	0
If he can't endorse you, do you think he should be chair of the Convention?	0
I don't want to mention now.	0
I'll see after.	0
I will give you a very solid answer, if that happens, about one minute after that happens.	0
Okay?	0
But there's no reason to give it right now.	0
But I'll be very quick with the answer.	0
Let's see what happens--	0
Well, it sounds like I know what the answer is, but you don't want to say it yet.	0
You don't want to sound-- you're not here-- you don't want to issue threats.	0
No, inappropriate.	0
We’ll see.	0
--you're not going to issue a public threat?	0
I don't think that's going to happen.	0
You know, the party's come together.	0
I have tremendous numbers of endorsements.	0
I'm never going to get Romney's endorsement.	0
He choked.	0
He blew the last election.	0
I'm never going to get that.	0
I'm never going to get Bush's election.	0
You know, he thought I was too rough on him.	0
He doesn't say that he spent $10 million on negative ads.	0
But Jeb Bush, I was tough on him, and he was trying to be tough on me, but he's not a very tough guy.	0
But you know, I was very tough on him.	0
But he spent $10 million or $12 million on negative ads on me.	0
So why shouldn’t I be?	0
The fact is--	0
You know--	0
--and by the way, Chuck.	0
Very important.	0
He signed a pledge.	0
He pledged that he would support the nominee.	0
And so did this lightweight, Lindsey Graham.	0
He pledged that he would support the nominee.	0
They ran.	0
They lost--	0
You threatened to back away from that pledge a lot, for various reasons--	0
No, no, no.	0
I didn't back away.	0
In fact, one of the reasons I didn't back away is that I happen to be, despite what a few people think, I happen to be a very honorable guy.	0
I signed a pledge.	0
And that's a binding pledge.	0
"You know, I heard, ""It's not binding."""	0
Well, it is a binding pledge.	0
I have the best lawyers in the world.	0
They say it's an absolutely binding pledge.	0
And I intended it to be binding.	0
Well, it was very binding for South Carolina.	0
That was the only way to get on the ballot.	0
Well, remember – Chuck, Chuck, remember this.	0
Jeb Bush signed a pledge.	0
A binding pledge.	0
Lindsey Graham signed a binding pledge that they would endorse.	0
That they would support and endorse.	0
That's what it says.	0
Now they're breaking.	0
You know, that's a question of honor.	0
They are not honorable people when they do that.	0
Because they're going against the pledge--	0
Let me ask you about Mitt Romney.	0
As you know, there's chatter that he's being recruited to run as an independent.	0
I know you say you don't care that you have his support.	0
But if you could have a sit-down with Mitt Romney, you know, he came to you as sort of a penitent man.	0
You know, he came to you when he was wanting your endorsement.	0
Have you thought about traveling to him and seeing if you can sort of calm the waters with him at all?	0
And if you did, what would you say to him?	0
Well, here's the story.	0
I helped Mitt a lot.	0
I raised a lot of money for him.	0
I ruined the carpet in my apartments, I had so many people come.	0
We actually had to have two fundraisers because there were so many people, for his wife, who is a fantastic woman, by the way.	0
I had these fundraisers in my apartment.	0
They called me for help.	0
And I did robocalls.	0
I did speeches for him.	0
I did everything during the primary season.	0
During the election season, for some reason, they should have used me in Florida.	0
He would have won Florida.	0
But they had this, you know, campaign manager, Stewart whatever, who didn't like Donald Trump.	0
He thought Donald Trump was too tough and too controversial, and don't use him.	0
So they didn't use me, and that was okay.	0
When it came down to the convention, I wasn't a part of the convention, and that was okay.	0
What happened is I was rough on Mitt because I didn't think they treated me properly.	0
I helped him, really helped him.	0
Gave him a lot of money.	0
Helped him with robocalls.	0
Every single robocall I made, he won that state.	0
Every single speech I made, he won the state, in terms of the primaries.	0
When it came time to the general election, I waited for the call.	0
I didn't care.	0
Look, if they don't want to call me, that's okay.	0
I'm a busy man.	0
I have a lot of things to do.	0
But if I would have been asked to help him in Florida, you saw what I did in Florida.	0
I won in a landslide.	0
I would have helped him.	0
I certainly could have gotten him over the ledge.	0
Let me--	0
Wait a minute.	0
Okay.	0
So if Mitt Romney did that, I would be happy to talk to him.	0
I think it's great.	0
And I would be because I respect him	0
You want him to thank you first, for 2012, before you will reach out to him--	0
I helped -- I helped Mitt Romney a lot.	0
And you feel like he was ungrateful--	0
I did.	0
I believe I won him, or helped him win, five states that he was going to lose in the primaries, okay--	0
Sounds like you think he was ungrateful.	0
You think he's been ungrateful?	0
He was.	0
He was ungrateful.	0
Which is okay.	0
A lot of people are ungrateful.	0
But he was ungrateful.	0
He did not--They did not respond accordingly.	0
And that's okay.	0
Alright.	0
But let's see what happens.	0
Let's see what happens--	0
Let me move on.	0
Let me move on some issue things.	0
There's a few things that some people think are contradictions, so I want to see if I can pin you down here.	0
The issue of taxes.	0
Your tax plan is one where the biggest beneficiaries are the 0.1 percent when it comes to raw dollars that will be saved among taxes.	0
"But then in an interview earlier this week, you seemed to say, ""You know what, my tax plan, it's not set in stone."	0
And maybe I'll raise taxes.	0
"Maybe I'll actually raise taxes on the rich."""	0
So I guess, which is it?	0
Are you willing to raise taxes on 0.1 percent or not--	0
It's definitely-- no, no, no.	0
Let me explain how the world works, okay?	0
I think nobody knows more about taxes than I do, and income than I do.	0
But I'll explain how it all works.	0
I come up with the biggest tax cut by far of any candidate.	0
Anybody.	0
And I put it in.	0
But that doesn't mean that's what we're going to get.	0
We have to negotiate.	0
The thing I'm going to do is make sure the middle class gets good tax breaks.	0
Because they have been absolutely shunned.	0
The other thing, I'm going to fight very hard for business.	0
For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up.	0
And you know what, it really should go up.	0
Because the wealthy--	0
The wealthy need to pay more taxes?	0
What do you define as wealthy, by the way--	0
No.	0
No, let me explain-- somebody like me.	0
Let me explain something--somebody like me--let me explain something.	0
I'm putting in a plan, Chuck.	0
I have to negotiate now with senators and congressmen and lots of-- the fact that I put in a plan, it really is a floor.	0
That's what it is.	0
Whether we like it or not.	0
So I put in my plan.	0
It's quite simple to see.	0
It's a simplification.	0
We lower the number of brackets.	0
We lower the taxes on the middle class, on business.	0
And we lower the taxes on everybody, very substantially.	0
But I have no illusions.	0
I don't think that's going to be the final plan.	0
Because they are going to come to me, including the Democrats and everybody else, they're going to come to me.	0
They're going to want to negotiate.	0
But that's a floor.	0
That's where we're starting.	0
So is that--	0
Now, when it comes time to negotiate, I feel less concerned with the rich than I do with the middle class.	0
So it sounds like-- should we take that--	0
And I feel very concerned at that.	0
--should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn't take you at your word, as sort of that they're floors?	0
What you just described?	0
"That, ""You know what, it's my opening statement, but everything is negotiable--"""	0
It’s not a word.	0
Excuse me.	0
Excuse me.	0
It's called life, Chuck.	0
It's not my word, of course.	0
I put in a proposal.	0
You know what they are?	0
They're really proposals.	0
People can say it's a tax plan.	0
It's really a tax proposal.	0
Because after I put it in, and I think you know the Senate and Congress--	0
Sure.	0
Yeah.	0
--you know as much as anybody, they start working with you, and they start fighting.	0
And you know, let's see what happens.	0
But I put in a proposal.	0
Under my proposal, it's the biggest tax cut by far, of any candidate by far.	1
But I'm not under the illusion that that's going to pass.	0
They're going to come to me.	0
They're going to want to raise it for the rich.	0
Frankly, they're going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else.	0
But the middle class has to be protected.	0
The rich is probably going to end up paying more.	0
And business might have to pay a little bit more.	0
But we're giving a massive business tax cut.	0
Remember this, we're the highest taxed nation in the world.	1
But this is a tax-- Chuck, this is a tax proposal--	0
Wait a minute.	0
Let me stop you there.	0
"You just said, ""Businesses might pay a little bit more."""	0
"You just said, ""Business might pay a little bit more, but we're going to get 'em a massive tax cut."""	0
You just said it within ten words.	0
No, no.	0
I didn't say it.	0
Excuse me.	0
I said they might have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, Chuck.	0
I said they might have--	0
Oh, your proposal.	0
Okay.	0
I just wanted to get that clear.	0
--yeah, than my proposal.	0
Fair enough.	0
I'm not talking about more than they're paying now.	0
Got you.	0
We're the highest taxed nation in the world.	1
Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world.	1
That's why companies are leaving.	0
So they may have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, is what I mean.	0
I assume you knew that.	0
I assume you know that.	0
Got you.	0
Okay.	0
No, no, no, no.	0
I just wanted to clear that up.	0
Okay, good.	0
Good, I'm glad you cleared it up--	0
Minimum wage.	0
Minimum wage.	0
At a debate, you know.	0
You remember what you said.	0
You thought you didn't want to touch it.	0
Now you're open to it.	0
What changed?	0
Let me just tell you, I've been traveling the country for many months.	0
Since June 16th.	0
I'm all over.	0
Today I'm in the state of Washington, where the arena right behind me, you probably hear, is packed with thousands and thousands of people.	0
I'm doing that right after I finish you.	0
I have seen what's going on.	0
And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour.	0
Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude.	0
But I'd rather leave it to the states.	0
Let the states decide.	0
Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other.	0
So you may have a governor --	0
Right.	0
You want the fed-- but should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states--	0
No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.	0
And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck.	0
So I like the idea of let the states decide.	0
But I think people should get more.	0
I think they're out there.	0
They're working.	0
It is a very low number.	0
You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost.	0
I mean, it's just-- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour.	0
But I would say let the states decide.	0
Another contradiction has been on your feelings toward Hillary Clinton.	0
In 2012, as she was leaving Secretary of State, you praised her.	0
You thought she did a good job.	0
"You even sort of said, ""You know what, she's not pushing her agenda."	0
"She had to carry on somebody else's agenda."""	0
"Before that, you didn't fault her on the Iraq War vote because you said, ""You know what, she got bad intelligence like a lot of other people got."""	0
Now, you're saying--	0
I didn't get bad intelligence.	0
I didn't get bad intelligence.	0
--you say all-- I understand that.	0
But you kind of forgave her on that early on.	0
"Now, you call her, ""She's been crooked from the start."""	0
I guess this goes back to which Donald Trump do we believe on your feelings toward Hillary Clinton--	0
So let me explain it.	0
--2012 or now?	0
Okay.	0
"So recently, a magazine said, ""Donald Trump's a world class businessman."""	0
And I am.	0
I built an amazing company.	0
Some of the greatest assets in the world.	0
And just great stuff.	0
All over the world, I go all over the world.	0
I'm in Europe, I'm in Asia.	0
I'm all over the world.	0
I'm not looking to get in fights with politicians.	0
I'm not looking to get in fights with the Secretary of State, so when I do something in a country, wherever it may be, in Dubai where I'm doing big jobs, and other places, and China where I'm actually getting ready to sign big jobs through my company.	0
Let me just tell you something.	0
I want to get along with politicians.	0
"So when somebody says, ""What do you think of Hillary Clinton?"""	0
Number one, I'm not looking at it that closely, because I'm in business.	0
"But when somebody says, three, four, five years ago, ""Let's look at Hillary Clinton."	0
"What do you think?"""	0
"I say, ""She's doing great."""	0
I say everybody's doing great.	0
The fact is she has not done a good job.	0
When I look at what happened with Libya.	0
When I look at what happened with Benghazi.	0
When you look at the migration.	0
When you look at all of the things.	0
But I'm not looking to criticize.	0
You can look at many politicians that haven't done a good job.	0
How are they doing?	0
They're doing just fine.	0
I'm not looking to get into wars with politicians, because I need politicians.	0
All right, last question.	0
Why not release the tax returns that aren't involved in the audit?	0
Because it's a link.	0
I have very big tax returns.	0
I'm sure you've seen the picture where the returns are literally from the floor to up to here.	0
They're extremely complex.	0
I get audited--	0
Do you think you can do it before the election, though?	0
I hope so.	0
I'd like to.	0
I have no problem releasing the tax returns--	0
Do you pledge to do it before the election?	0
Excuse me.	0
Sure.	0
If the auditors finish.	0
I'll do it as fast as the auditors finish.	0
Remember this, I've already given my financials.	0
And my financials show I'm worth more than $10 billion by any stretch of the imagination.	0
Has tremendous cash.	0
Tremendous cash flow.	0
You don't learn much from tax returns.	0
But I would love to give the tax returns.	0
But I can't do it until I'm finished with the audit.	0
Donald Trump, I've got to leave it there.	0
The crowd, it's fired up.	0
We already heard Mike Leach, Steve Emtman.	0
It's fired up.	0
Big Washington State stars up there.	0
Thank you for coming on, sir.	0
That's right.	0
They're great people.	0
Thank you.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Within minutes of finishing the interview with me, Donald Trump said something that is going to raise some eyebrows.	0
This is what he said about women at that rally in Spokane, Washington.	0
I mean, all of the men were petrified to speak to women anymore.	0
We may raise our voice.	0
You know what?	0
The women get it better than we do, folks.	0
We'll discuss that after the break.	0
And throughout the morning, we want to show you moments from commencement addresses around the country from some key political leaders.	0
We'll start with President Obama at Howard University.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Given the current state of our political rhetoric and debate let me say something that may be controversial.	0
And that is this, America is a better place today than it was when I graduated from college.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Welcome back.	0
Our panel is here.	0
Matt Bai, national political correspondent and columnist for Yahoo News, Republican strategist and pollster Kellyanne Conway, fresh off of Cruz super PAC world.	0
Welcome, good to see you here.	0
Thank you.	0
Happy Mother's Day, by the way.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Andrea Mitchell, chief foreign affairs correspondent, and of course, Eugene Robinson, Pulitzer-Prize winner of The Washington Post.	0
I teased everybody with that quote that Trump said at this rally, and let me play it again for anybody that forgot about it.	0
Let's take a listen.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
I mean, all of the men we’re petrified to speak to women anymore.	0
We may raise our voice.	0
You know what?	0
The women get it better than we do, folks.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Kellyanne, thoughts?	0
Well, that's his whole riff on political correctness.	0
He's not talking about what I think the Hillary people will say he meant, which is pay equity and reproductive rights and healthcare access for women and their children.	0
He's talking about political correctness.	0
"I mean, this is a man who over the course of the year, as the frontrunner, the entire time, and now the presumptive nominee, Chuck, has been able to really cash in with voters on this ""us versus them."""	0
"And the ""them"" changes all the time."	0
"The ""them"" is the big system, the ""them"" is political correctness, the ""them"" is the people who take money for--"	0
"There's always a ""them."""	0
"There's always a ""them."""	0
And I think this is just part of that.	0
Andrea?	0
Well, he's tapping into, as Kellyanne said, the anger.	0
And talking about a rigged system, he's also embracing Bernie Sanders because he's trying to recruit the anti-Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders supporters, tap into all of that, they're all against us, the establishment, Hillary Clinton is the establishment.	0
And he doesn't answer questions or he changes his positions at will.	0
And he still manages to get away with it because he is talking above the level of people questioning him.	0
But Matt, I was just thinking, imagine if Mitt Romney had said that quote.	0
Yeah, yeah.	0
Four years ago.	0
But this is--	0
I mean, he got punished for what Todd Akin said four years ago.	0
"But ""binders of women"" wasn't exactly the finest moment."	0
It wasn't, but this is something you would think would become--	0
Binders of women wasn't great.	0
No, it's the same reason, the reason he can, you know, we call it a flip-flop, right, when somebody says one thing and does another.	0
Politics, you can't get away with it.	0
The voters don't like it, it's a sign of inauthenticity, right?	0
Inconsistency.	0
One thing we learned in this primary process, and I think we need to heed it very carefully going forward, he is not judged by the standards of a politician.	0
He is judged by the standards of an entertainer.	0
And entertainers, by the way, reinvent themselves constantly.	0
Read any gossip magazine, they're constantly changing who they are, what they say.	0
The question that remains over this general election is in a general election, with a different broader electorate, is he judged as a politician, or is he judged the way you'd judge an entertainer?	0
Because if it's the latter that’s a different thing.	0
I think that's totally right.	0
I think that's what we saw throughout that interview.	0
"When you started asking him about his contradictions and about the issues, ""What do you think about minimum wage?"""	0
Well, yes and no, right?	0
I mean, he needs to go either way.	0
He's going to go both ways.	0
The same on every issue that you tried to pin him down on.	0
And so I think it makes the general election campaign totally unpredictable, except in its unpredictability, except in the fact that Trump will run to the left of Clinton on some issues, to the right on other issues.	0
And that might set--	0
"But are conservatives going, ""See, we told you he would do this."""	0
He's doing exactly what Ted Cruz said he was going to do.	0
Some are, Chuck.	0
And they're welcome to their opinions.	0
However, you can't leave on the field the ten-million-plus voters who supported this man in the primaries.	0
It's a historically high figure.	0
And I just have to push back a little bit.	0
I don't think it's fair to say he's judged as an entertainer.	0
What he's judged as is a non-politician.	0
And we found out, the super PAC--	0
The hard way.	0
--that, politicians are held for account now for their positions.	0
Non-politicians will be held sometime in the future for their positions.	0
But look, I'm not sure that the election this fall will be a referendum on Donald Trump.	0
It could be a referendum on Hillary Clinton.	0
"It's going to be easy for him to say, ""Look, you've been in public life for 30 years, so if you want to improve the lot of women, where have you been?"""	0
Let's go though to this Ryan riff a little bit.	0
Donors, it was funny, is it donor generated or was it a message to donors, a message to incumbents who are afraid of running with Trump?	0
I think what Paul Ryan is saying is that he has to protect the House majority.	0
He has to protect, you know, incumbent Congress members who are concerned about the Donald Trump effect.	0
So he's basically going to worry about the swing districts, which is his majority, and those in the safe districts can go with Trump or do whatever they have to do.Look, the fact that he changed his position on minimum wage and on his tax proposal in one interview with you, and has also said importantly, he said in the last 48 hours on CNBC that he would let the U.S. default.	0
He would let the U.S. become Greece.	0
"When he is saying, ""I'm not going to pay 100% on treasury bonds,"" he is saying something to Republican donors, to the business community, that is so shocking, that if it is widely--"	0
Right, but does that hurt him politically?	0
Well, it hurts him within--	0
Does it?	0
I mean--	0
No.	0
No.	0
I mean, look--	0
I think it does.	0
If--	0
Not now.	0
If it is properly explained.	0
I think it hurts him some.	0
If I'm Donald Trump, and there are few people I'd less likely be, but if I were Donald Trump, I'd go right into the teeth of that.	0
I think it'd be a terrible mistake to try and be the Republican standard bearer.	0
He has to run against the entire system and this is an opening for him to do that.	0
Right, but he walks a line when he says these outrageous things that are crazy, perhaps, that we think are crazy, but somehow he never goes too far for his base.	0
There are things he could say that would go too far for his base.	0
Okay.	0
What?	0
And you know what?	0
We don't know yet.	0
We don't know what they are yet, do we?	0
We don't know what they are yet.	0
We always think we did.	0
I am confident that they're out there.	0
"We're going to talk more about all the ""we thinks"" and ""we thoughts"" and what happens later."	0
When we come back though, how long has it been since a candidate has been this far behind at the start of the general election campaign?	0
That's where Trump is right now.	0
So what are the chances that Trump can make up the difference?	0
We'll show you what history says.	0
And we continue hearing from commencement speakers from the weekend of the political ilk.	0
Here's Mitt Romney.	0

We live in tumultuous times.	0

Welcome back, Data Download time.	0
You probably know by now that Donald Trump is behind Hillary Clinton in the polls.	0
But did you know that the last time a candidate was this far behind at this stage has actually been more than a generation ago?	0
Let's dive in.	0
In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted a few weeks ago, we had Donald Trump trailing Hillary Clinton nationally by 11 points, it’s actually particularly an unprecedented number.	0
Let me compare.	0
For instance, when Mitt Romney clinched the Republican nomination in April of 2012, he trailed President Obama at that point in time by six.	0
He ended up losing by four.	0
Senator John McCain started only two points behind Senator Obama in March, 2008, when he had become the presumptive nominee.	0
Of course, McCain lost by seven.	0
John Kerry was behind incumbent George W. Bush at two points in March of '04, the month he became the presumptive nominee.	0
By the way, the race essentially stayed in the same place.	0
Kerry lost by three.	0
In 2000, it was March when both Gore and Bush became presumptive nominees of their respective parties.	0
That first match-up had Bush up 46-41.	0
Gore made up the ground on the popular vote, but he lost the electoral college and of course Bush won.	0
You have to go all the way back to 1996 to find a presumptive nominee in worse shape than Trump is right now.	0
And that was Bob Dole.	0
He trailed Bill Clinton by 17 points at the start of the general election campaign in May of '96.	0
But Dole did make up some ground, but he eventually lost in an electoral landslide by eight points.	0
So what does this all mean?	0
Donald Trump of course was never an underdog in the G.O.P.	0
primary.	0
He led in nearly every poll after he entered the race.	0
Many folks just simply thought we should ignore the polls, that the polls were wrong, that they were oversampling Trump voters.	0
The polls were right, Trump won.	0
But those same polls have all had Trump losing to Clinton and in many cases, losing them badly.	0
Can Trump make up the ground?	0
History as we just showed you, says no.	0
But then again, he's already defied history once.	0
When we come back, an example of what Donald Trump is up against.	0
A Republican senator who's not ready to endorse him.	0
But he's also not ready to reject him outright either.	0
Welcome back.	0
As we said earlier, divided parties lose elections.	0
It's a pretty simple proposition.	0
Let me show you some history here.	0
In '68, the Democrats were split.	0
They had their establishment vice president, Hubert Humphrey.	0
They had a peace-wing candidate led by Eugene McCarthy.	0
That riff played out on the streets of Chicago and helped Richard Nixon take the White House.	0
'76, Gerald Ford was challenged on the right all the way to the convention by Ronald Reagan.	0
A fight, arguably, some could say, to help put Jimmy Carter into the White House that fall.	0
1980, it was Carter's turn.	0
A bitter challenge from the left by Senator Ted Kennedy certainly helped Reagan win 44 states and the presidency.	0
1992, George H. W. Bush was the president, he had a populist primary challenger in the very conservative Pat Buchanan, an insurgency arguably that helped make Bush a one-term president.	0
Joining me now is a man who's emblematic of the current split in the Republican party.	0
He's Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who right now says he's not ready to support Donald Trump, but he also hasn't ruled it out either.	0
Senator Flake, welcome back to the show, sir.	0
Hey, thanks for having me on.	0
So you have said he's got to earn your support, you're looking for him to change his tone, change some of it, particularly the issue on the temporary ban on Muslims seems to be among the things that you find most difficult to support because it doesn't pass constitutional muster.	0
If he doesn't retract that, can you ever support him?	0
You know, I can't see that.	0
He's got to soften his position there.	0
I mean, a total and complete ban on Muslims, that is a religious test that is certainly against the constitution.	0
And it is the last thing we should do if we want to win a war on terrorism.	0
So it's constitutionally wrong and also strategically, it's just not a smart thing to do.	0
So what should the party do though?	0
What do you want?	0
Do you want to see Mitt Romney run?	0
If Trump's not going to back away from these things, and you can't support him, what do you do?	0
How do you help your friend John McCain win his reelection in Arizona?	0
You know, obviously Donald Trump was not my first choice or my 17th choice to put it mildly.	0
However, he is the nominee, the presumptive nominee.	0
I don't see a third-party challenger come along.	0
I would rather, as Paul Ryan has said, rather Mr. Trump simply change some of his positions and modify what he has said.	0
Now, I think he's going to need to, we are well behind in the polls right now, and in order to win this election, if Republicans want to win, and we do, then we've got to change the approach because we're not going to win taking these positions.	0
You know, some Trump supporters would say modifying has been the problem with Republican nominees in the past.	0
Modifying, not saying what you believe, not speaking truth to power, or however you want to characterize what Trump is doing.	0
"And they say, ""Hey, the voters have spoken, Senator, you need to get on board with him."	0
"Why should he be obligated to get on board with where the Republican party is?"""	0
Republican voters have spoken in a primary.	0
We've found in the past that that's a big difference from voters speaking in a general election.	0
We're now moving to a general election and it's a different ballgame completely.	0
We've found in the past, and we've done an autopsy every time we come out of one of these elections that we, for example, need a better position on immigration.	0
Simply saying we're going to deport 11 million people, that's not a position you can take in a general election.	0
It's not a rational approach.	0
So a general election is far different from a primary election.	0
Do you accept this idea though that if a significant chunk of party leadership, like yourself, Speaker Ryan, doesn't end up rallying around Trump, it probably is the death warrant for his candidacy in the fall.	0
Are you comfortable with that?	0
I don't think that that's death warrant for his candidacy.	0
I think supporting a religious test for people to come here, saying you're going to change libel laws to make it easier to sue those who you don't agree with, saying that we're going to default on the debt, taking positions like that are what is going to impede your campaign, not the fact that some Republican leaders disagree with you.	0
"Is there anything from Trump's success that in these primaries that made you think, ""You know what, maybe I ought to rethink my position on X""?"	0
You know, like I said, it's one thing to win a primary.	0
We all know that it's easier to win a primary taking certain positions, sometimes hard-core positions.	0
But we always know that those positions may not work in a general either.	0
So it's one thing to win a primary, it's a complete other ballgame to win a general election.	0
We're out to win a general election as Republicans.	0
We don't want another eight years or another four years of a Democrat in the White House.	0
And so we've got to take a different position than we've taken in the primary.	0
"You're one of the few Republicans that met with the president Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, you called him a ""man of accomplishment,"" and somebody with a quote, ""keen intellect."""	0
But you also believe that you want to wait for the election.	0
You think the voters should have a say in this before dealing with the Supreme Court vacancy.	0
Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee, have you changed your mind on that pledge?	0
I think Republicans are more than justified in waiting.	0
That is following both principle and precedent.	0
But the principle is to have the most conservative, qualified jurists that we can have on the Supreme Court, not that the people ought to decide before the next election.	0
I've never held that position.	0
If we come to a point, I’ve said all along, where we're going to lose the election, or we lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him quickly.	0
Because I'm certain that he'll be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination comes January.	0
All right.	0
Jeff Flake, Republican senator from Arizona, I'm going to leave it there.	0
Thanks for getting up early out there and coming on this morning.	0
I appreciate it.	0
Glad to do it.	0
Alrighty.	0
We'll be back in a moment, but first Dana Carvey's church lady made a comeback last night on S.N.L.	0
Take a look.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Now we've landed on the exciting presidential match-up between a godless, liberal Democrat and Hillary Clinton.	0
(END TAPE)	0
We are back.	0
So, how does the Republican Party put this all back together?	0
It’s just interesting hearing from Jeff Flake, um, Kellyanne.	0
Uh, I want to put up what Bill Bennett said.	0
Bill Bennett, you know, you have Jeff Flake, Paul Ryan, they’re in one place.	0
Bill Bennett said this: “It’s not the time to be out there demanding all of these things, trying to get Trump to suddenly become Reagan.	0
Now is the time to surround him with good people and work with him at the convention.”	0
You said something interesting during the break, you said this is generational in the conservative movement.	0
Explain.	0
Some of it is, you know how John McCain was saying he’ll vote for Donald Trump, I mean, he obviously has --	0
Bob Dole.	0
Bob Dole.	0
Newt Gingrich.	0
Bill Bennett, now.	0
It is somewhat generation for them.	0
They recognize that it’s healthy for a party going through some growing pains to actually shed some of its skin.	0
I also -- I also want to get back to Senator Flake’s interview, because I thought it was astonishing for this reason: Donald Trump just won 48 percent of the vote in the Republican primary -- every single delegate in Flake’s home state of Arizona, he got 250,000 voters, and you just can’t ignore that.	0
I mean his policies on immigration began in Jan Brewer’s Arizona.	0
And so I think there's a zeitgeist out there that some of the establishment of a Republican party are still ignoring.	0
And I would say, when I think of Senator Flake, I also, who I respect enormously, I think of this whole class of 2010 that is up for reelection in the Senate in 2016 this year.	0
They rode the Tea Party wave.	0
And now they've switched to decaf somehow.	0
It's like your votes are so moderate, and if you look back--	0
They got into government.	0
They got into government.	0
And you go back a year ago, and look at their approval ratings and their reelect numbers a year ago.	0
They weren't doing so well.	0
So laying it just at the feet of Donald Trump I think is naïve and inaccurate.	0
But to your point about the generational divide, the idea that a bunch of senior figures are going to sit Donald Trump down in a room and coach him up, I mean, this is just insane.	0
It's not going to happen, right?	0
And more to that point, Trump knows it's not going to happen.	0
Trump is behaving as if this is his party now.	0
And that's what they're up against.	0
"And when Paul Ryan was saying, you know, ""I want to hear a different tone,"" he does not want to hear what Donald Trump then went right out and did, which was to talk about Hillary Clinton, the philandering of Bill Clinton, how she was an enabler, he talked about murderers involved in Whitewater."	0
In that very next speech, he was going in every direction that Paul Ryan does not want to hear.	0
He really wants to see whether Donald Trump can speak differently.	0
And he's not going to speak differently.	0
He can say one thing when he's on a teleprompter and another when he's out in front of a crowd, which is egging him on and reinforcing his basic instincts.	0
And Newt Gingrich, you can put Gingrich on the ticket, which is part of what's going on also, you know, put a running mate on who can help work with Congress.	0
That is not going to change Donald Trump.	0
But as a Republican strategist here, I just have to say, Paul Ryan, who I have great affection, admiration for, he was on the ticket last time.	0
The Romney/Ryan ticket lost eight of the nine swing states, they lost his home state of Wisconsin by almost seven points--	0
I don't think you can blame the running mate for what happened at the top of the ticket.	0
Well -- but it's fine, it's just that it's like, you had your chance last time.	0
I mean, they got 5 percent of the African American vote in Wisconsin.	0
They got beaten among Hispanics by two to one.	0
Is Trump going to do worse than that?	0
"Kellyanne makes a really, well, meaning to I think makes a really-- it was an interesting point here, which is about, you know, for years, for cycles and cycles and cycles, the Republican establishment has basically said to the base of the Republican party, ""You lost--"""	0
Fall in line.	0
--swallow it, get in line.	0
And we have.	0
"Now they're being asked to get in line, and suddenly it's, ""But it's not your party."""	0
Wait a minute -- you inherited it.	0
And Trump rightfully said, “Inherited it?	0
"I won it."""	0
I won it.	0
won it.	0
did not inherit the party, I won it.	0
And he's right.	0
He beat them.	0
He beat them badly.	0
Guys, look at where Hillary Clinton is going to be tomorrow.	0
She's going to be in LoudounCounty, Virginia.	0
Actually, today I believe.	0
I think they're campaigning, I think that starts today.	0
No that is her tomorrow, Monday afternoon.	0
Loudoun County, Virginia.	0
That is where she is going to go for a Republican and swing voters for women, married women, older women, because she has not gotten the millennials, she knows she's got a big problem there.	0
But that is where she is trying to fight a general election strategy.	0
Kelly, and I want to let you to have the last--	0
And the following day she’s going to lose in West Virginia and Oregon.	0
Right.	0
But I want you to have the last word here on women.	0
You have spent a lot of time polling women for the Republican party, trying to help them with their problems with the gender gap.	0
How does Donald Trump fix this gender gap issue?	0
He has to go on the issues.	0
And so, because so far, I think if Hillary Clinton runs a strict ideological and identity-politics campaign, she could lose.	0
And she also has a problem among men.	0
I think part of what Donald Trump says on the stump is very machismo, because Hillary Clinton has the reverse gender gap.	0
Men dislike her, don't trust her, and don't want her to be commander in chief--	0
Who's the majority of the country, though.	0
Of course they are.	0
And he will, I think he has to fight her on the issues.	0
Because the one thing that's not going to change between now and November is who is the outsider and who is the insider.	0
And this does seem to be an outsider's election.	0
Boy, if he has to fight her on the issues, I don't know.	0
Well, where has she been for 30 years?	0
I'm going to do a quick 45-second pause and we’ll pick this back up here.	0
Endgame is coming up.	0
But first, we're going to continue.	0
Here's Bill Clinton speaking to a class of 2016 as well.	0
Take a listen.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
The last two years has seen an amazing explosion of economic, social, and political empowerment.	0
They have also laid bare the power of persistent inequalities, political and social instability, and identity politics based on the simple proposition that our differences are all that matter.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Coming up, Meet the Press endgame, brought to you by Boeing, building the future one century at a time.	0
End Game time and I always feel bad when we have a great conversation and then the 45-second break and I’m like I want to recreate that.	0
Quickly Bill Clinton you had an interesting reaction you guys just now to his commencement Matt.	0
Well you can see that these years have been difficult for him, he is struggling with his legacy of the 90’s.	0
That he is so proud of which has gotten pilloried now by both parties.	0
And I think that he is trying to to make the case, that that progress is real and that the rest of it isn't his fault.	0
And I think that he's always haunted by that--	0
But also, Bill Clinton's Democratic party is gone.	0
They've purged their pro-lifers, they're pro-Second Amendment, there are no boll weevil Democrats, no Blue Dog Democrats who are the fiscally conservative.	0
Or the D.L.C.	0
that he helped create.	0
It's disbanded.	0
And his own wife has left him on that.	0
That's correct.	0
She has now moved so far towards Bernie Sanders, and she can't move back again.	0
But i thought it was --fascinating, you know, we could have done 20 minutes on what he meant by that.	0
Well yeah, yeah.	0
He seems a little fearful of the change.	0
Well, he's fearful of the change, he doesn't like the fact that identity politics and microtargeting, and all of that--	0
Or that he’s being protested against--	0
--that's not Bill Clinton.	0
That's not his style.	0
All right, let's move to the media.	0
"Jim Rutenberg is the media writer at The New York Times, he wrote this: ""Every election cycle brings questionable news coverage, but this season has been truly spectacular in its failings."	0
It has been 'Dewey Defeats Truman' on a relentless, rolling basis.	0
The mistakes piled up, the bad predictions, the overplaying of every slight development of the horse race to the point of whiplash, the lighthearted treatment of what turned out to be the most serious candidacy in the Republican field.	0
"The lessons learned did not."""	0
I'm sort of amused by this coming from The New York Times.	0
Eugene, not to pile on one newspaper, but if you were to compare, say, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, the two big behemoths, The Post took Trump more seriously--	0
Uh, yeah,more seriously.	0
--quicker than The Times did.	0
Right, right.	0
The key to covering this campaign was to cover the campaign as it was, not as you thought it should be.	0
Or wished it was.	0
Or wished it was, or whatever.	0
And so observer bias crept into a lot of coverage and people took more seriously the data points that confirmed their view than the data points that refuted their view.	0
And so while Donald Trump was winning, he was way ahead in the polls, and so people would write that well, 56 percent of Republicans voted for somebody other than Donald Trump.	0
Well, yeah.	0
But, 85 percent voted for somebody other than Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or whatever, so.	0
But i don’t think--I don't think you can escape the fact that he got enormous amounts of free media and that it was all focused on live carrying of his rallies and reporting every tweet.	0
And there was less policy discussion, less policy coverage, not just about Donald Trump but all of the candidates.	0
It was more horserace, more poll driven, more social-media driven than in any previous campaign--	0
But by the way, the candidates was more poll driven.	0
Don’t forget the candidates--I know	0
But that doesn't mean that you define it.	0
I understand that.	0
But here was another thing I'm wondering, if you're Ted Cruz, or if you're any candidate in the future, message discipline is a negative.	0
It's actually a negative.	0
It has been for awhile.	0
That's right.	0
By the way, apparently because it's boring?	0
It's boring.	0
And it's also, look, it's not just the coverage.	0
I think there was, to Gene's point, conclusions in search of evidence--	0
Yes, yes.	0
--the entire time this race was covered.	0
And I think it's been very humbling for some folks.	0
But it’s also, I don't think Donald Trump could have run as effectively four or eight years ago.	0
He's got this multilevel media platform now.	0
If he's not tweeting, he's rallying.	0
If he's not rallying, he's giving interviews to folks like you, Chuck.	0
But I also want to say something else that's not been said.	0
I think it's also, he's just much more fun to cover than Hillary Clinton.	0
And that's going to matter this fall too.	0
Well, he was much more excessive.	0
Correct.	0
I think there's a little bit of a false dichotomy here.	0
I agree with Andrea and I've written a lot about the role that the media played, particularly in the early phase of this campaign.	0
"But it was a little bit about, I think Jim, who's a fantastic writer and a friend of mine, sets up a little bit of a false dichotomy by saying, you know, ""He was treated too much as an entertainer and not taken seriously as a politician."""	0
I think the real mistake is the media not understanding that there is no line between politics and entertainment in this environment.	0
Well, what a segue.	0
And that's where we've ended up.	0
Because speaking of no line in politics and entertainment, here's S.N.L.	0
last night.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Donnie, there are those who say you're not qualified, and that's not true.	0
You know, I remember a Celebrity Apprentice episode where Gary Busey didn't sell enough pancakes.	0
"And you just said, ""You're fired."""	0
"And I thought right then and there, ""Give this man the nuclear codes."""	0
A lot of people are saying that.	0
(END TAPE)	0
I mean, it is the culture that has changed the political coverage as well.	0
And the technology.	0
Yes.	0
Exactly	0
Trump has seen it.	0
Yeah.	0
Obama was the guy that saw it in '08.	0
Trump saw it now.	0
And the Clinton people think that Obama is going to be this political nuclear weapon to go out on a trail,	0
Could be.	0
--and could be to rally his coalition behind her even though people in his coalition are still lukewarm about her.	0
But boy, that's a line--	0
There's a history, there’s a history--	0
You guys can keep talking, but I'm going to turn the cameras off.	0
You guys have been terrific.	0
That's all for today.	0
Happy Mother's Day.	0
CVS is still open if you've forgotten.	0
So hurry up.	0
If it's Sunday though, it's Meet the Press.	0
And welcome back.	0
We’re coming to you tonight from the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee with the “360” townhall.	0
The three remaining Republican candidates campaigning hard with the primary here just a week away.	0
We heard so far from Senator Ted Cruz.	0
Right now the GOP front-runner, New York businessman Donald Trump.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you.	0
Hey, how are you doing?	0
Nice to see you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Have a seat.	0
Thank you.	0
So we got a lot of questions from the audience for you on a lot of policy issues.	0
I got to start off with some news of the day topics.	0
Your campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter by the arm.	0
Will he continue as your campaign manager?	0
Yes, he will.	0
I looked at the tape.	0
I looked — it was my tape.	0
It was at one of my places.	0
I have great security and great security cameras.	0
I gave the tape, and frankly, if you look at that, people have looked at it — in fact, I just left another area of Wisconsin, we had a whole big meeting with a whole group of people, big audience, tremendous audience, and they’re all shaking their heads, give me a break, give me a break.	0
Let me ask you, though…	0
The answer is yes.	0
And by the way, speaking of something else, I watched Ted Cruz.	0
His home state is not Florida.	0
His home state is Texas.	0
It may be Canada.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
But to the best of my knowledge, it’s Texas.	0
So he made that — I was surprised you didn’t correct him actually.	0
Let me ask you about Lewandowski.	0
Initially your campaign said this never happened, there was no video of it.	0
You came out and said you thought this person was, perhaps, making it up, this reporter.	0
Lewandowski, himself, tweeted saying, I never met this reporter, I never touched this person; now the videotape shows he clearly did touch this person.	0
Whether or not you think it was battery or not…	0
Touch — I don’t know what touch means.	0
I looked…	0
Well, he says I never touched this person.	0
And then she says, oh, look, at my arm.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Did he mislead you at all?	0
Not at all.	0
No, not at all.	0
Look, I didn’t know we had all these security cameras all over.	0
But the time I found out, I said, well, this is really wonderful, this exonerates him totally.	0
Now…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
(inaudible) would have happened (inaudible) went to the ground or something to the effect that she almost went to the ground.	0
She was in pain.	0
She went to the ground.	0
When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.	1
She didn’t talk about it.	0
No, that’s not true.	0
She says her story has remained exactly the same.	0
She was knocked a little bit off…	0
Oh really?	0
Can I read this to you this then?	0
Yes, that she was knocked off balance but she remained standing.	0
Do you mind if I read this to you?	0
Do you mind if I read you her statement?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I mean, give me a break.	0
You know, the problem is everybody dumps people when there’s, like, a sign of political incorrectness.	0
I’m just going to read, if I can find it…	0
She said she was almost knocked off balance, but she remained standing.	0
She said she was almost knocked off balance, right.	0
Here’s what she said.	0
You want to read it?	0
Or you want me to do it?	0
You’re a professional announcer.	0
Why don’t you read it.	0
The bottom part.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
The bottom.	0
Now that’s an exact quote from her prior to seeing the cameras, and now she says, oh, I better change my story, I guess.	0
This quote says, “I was jolted backwards.	0
Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down.	0
I almost knell fell to the ground but was able..”.	0
Yanked you down.	0
Did you see it?	0
Did she almost fall to the ground, Anderson?	0
“… was able to maintain my balance nonetheless.	0
I was shaken.	0
Campaign managers aren’t supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground.”	0
No, she did not go down on the ground.	0
Oh no, let me just say — look, before she knows — folks, look, I’m a loyal person.	0
I’m going to be loyal to the country.	0
I’m going to be loyal to Wisconsin.	0
We have to tell it like it is.	0
It would be so easy for me to terminate this man, ruin his life, ruin his family.	0
He’s got four beautiful children in New Hampshire, ruin his whole everything, and say you’re fired.	0
Okay?	0
I fired many people, especially on “The Apprentice.”	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
But look at what she says.	0
Michelle Fields, who, by the way, is not a baby.	0
OK?	0
In her own worlds, exactly.	0
“I was jolted backwards.” Well, she’s standing there.	0
“Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm.”  Tightly.	0
“And yanked me down.” She wasn’t yanked down.	0
She was – like, she didn’t even have any expression.	0
If somebody in this audience gets whacked, or gets hurt, including me, you get hit a little bit.	0
You go, ow.	0
There’s no emotion.	0
OK, wait a minute.	0
“I almost fell to the ground.” I almost fell to the ground; she didn’t almost fall to the ground.	0
He got in her way.	0
And by the way, she was grabbing me!	0
Am I supposed to press charges against her?	0
Oh, my arm is hurting.	0
Anderson, my arm is just killing me.	0
It’s never been the same.	0
You’ve suggested you might —	0
Excuse me, excuse me!	0
I didn’t suggest.	0
Oh, yeah, you did.	0
I tweeted.	0
No, no, I tweeted.	0
A tweet is a suggestion.	0
Should I press charges?	0
Are you going to?	0
Sure!	0
I don’t know.	0
Maybe I should, right?	0
Because you know what?	0
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)	0
She was grabbing me.	0
And just so you understand, she was off base because she went through the Secret Service.	0
She had a pen in her hand which Secret Service is not liking because they don’t know what it is, whether it’s a little bomb or —	0
So it doesn’t concern you that initially Corey Lewandowski said I never touched her, and that turns out not to be true?	0
I don’t think he knew her.	0
I mean, based on what I heard, I don’t think he really even knew who she was.	0
To the best of my knowledge, they really didn’t know each other.	0
Or he said he doesn’t know her.	0
But listen to this: “I almost fell to the ground,” which is untrue, “but was able to maintain my balance.” She had no trouble with her balance because it’s right on tape.	0
“Nonetheless, I was shaken.	0
Campaign managers aren’t supposed to try to forcefully throw reporters to the ground.” She didn’t go to the ground!	0
She didn’t even have an expression on her face.	0
Do you think this is politically motivated?	0
It could be.	0
I don’t know.	0
Look, I’ll tell you what: a friend of mine who’s in law enforcement said to me, there’s probably not a detective in the world that would have done what they did to him.	0
I mean, people in Syria —	0
The state attorney’s a Democrat.	0
Excuse me, excuse me.	0
Oh, really?	0
Oh, I’m shocked to hear that.	0
You know,	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
You know, people, are chopping off heads in the Middle East.	0
They’re drowning people in cages by 50s.	0
They’re drowning — here’s a guy – she shouldn’t have been touching me.	0
Okay?	0
And you saw that she did that.	0
She was grabbing me.	0
Twice.	0
I looked at her.	0
In fact, one of the great pictures is me going like this like, get away from me, who is this person?	0
Okay?	0
But my arm, it’s never been the same, folks.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Never been the same.	0
So let me just tell you, she went through Secret Service, boom.	0
She grabbed me, and he really stepped in front of her.	0
I didn’t see the grab; he stepped in front of her.	0
She wasn’t supposed to be asking questions because the press conference lasted for 45 minutes, and all questions were done.	0
And I was walking rapidly outside.	0
But this is the second time Lewandowski has touched somebody.	0
He did this to a protester, he grabbed a guy by the collar.	0
Something which you actually backed him up on And you said –	0
I back people up.	0
And I back up (INAUDIBLE).	0
Did you see what he did?	0
Did you see what he did?	0
I did.	0
In fact, there’s the video right there.	0
Did you see the sign the protester was holding?	0
No I didn’t.	0
Did you see what was on that sign?	0
No, I didn’t.	0
Do me a favor.	0
Take a look at what was on the sign.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
But should your campaign manager be laying hands on anybody?	0
Excuse me.	0
Did you see the protester grabbing the woman in front of him?	0
With his hands on her neck?	0
No.	0
OK. Take a look.	0
You know what he did?	0
He had his shirt with two fingers like this, and then he let go because security was behind him, and they took off.	0
Your opponents are suggesting, on the Republican side, are suggesting that this says something about your leadership, that you’re condoning this kind of thing –	0
Oh, I think my leadership is very good.	0
I’ve watched Ted Cruz, I watched him.	0
He didn’t even know what state he comes from, OK?	0
I watched him talking about he comes from the state of Florida.	0
Fort Hood is in Texas, by the way.	0
But if you see what he said.	0
I don’t know.	0
I’m so surprised with him, Anderson, that you let him get away with that.	0
But I’ll tell you what.	0
You just take a look – you just take a look at what’s going on.	0
I stick up for people when they’re right.	0
I would have loved to have fired – it would have been much easier than talking to you about this all night long.	0
I’d rather talk about the issues, to be honest.	0
But I stick up –	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Right?	0
I stick up for people when people are unjustly accused.	0
And in my opinion, unjustly accused.	0
She’s grabbing me.	0
He walks in to stop it.	0
She walked through Secret Service.	0
She had a pen in her hand, which could have been a knife, it could have been just a pen, which is very dangerous.	0
She should not have been doing that.	0
And she didn’t fall to the ground.	0
She wasn’t dragged to the ground and all of the things that she said, Anderson.	0
I stick up for people, and I don’t want to ruin somebody’s life.	0
It would have been very easy for me to do so.	0
You know, when I owned Miss Universe, I had the case of the young woman who was very unjustly accused by somebody that you know very well.	0
And I gave her a second chance.	0
And I’m very proud of her.	0
She had a tremendous substance abuse problem and I’m very – Tara, I’m very, very proud of her.	0
I’m very proud of the job she did.	0
I want to ask you about another tweet you sent.	0
You sent a tweet over the weekend about the death toll in this horrible terror attack in Pakistan over the weekend.	0
Right.	0
You talked about the death toll.	0
And then you said, I alone can solve.	0
What do you mean by that?	0
I think I alone because I know my competition.	0
Look, I know my competition.	0
You, alone, among the Republican candidates.	0
I see Hillary with Benghazi, you know the famous ad, 3:00 in the morning, guess what, the phone rang, she wasn’t there.	0
Unless Sidney called, if Sidney called she was there.	0
But you’re the only one who can solve terror problems in Pakistan?	0
I mean, Pakistan…	0
Yes, of the ones that are running, I’m the only one.	0
I know what I’m running.	0
I know the competition.	0
And believe me, I know, I watched Ted Cruz.	0
How though?	0
I mean, what…	0
So phony.	0
I mean, you know, I know you have couple people out there because he put them in the audience.	0
But it’s so false.	0
You know, the whole thing with the five-second intermissions between sentences.	0
No.	0
Yes, I think I am the one to be able to solve the problem.	0
But, I mean, there’s problems in a lot of different countries, problems in the United States.	0
How can you solve the problems all the way over in Pakistan when the Pakistanis, themselves, are struggling with it?	0
Look, look, Pakistan is a very, very vital problem and really vital country for us because they have a thing called nuclear weapons.	0
They have to get a hold of their situation.	0
When I see that and when I see it put in a park because it was mostly Christians, although many others were killed other than Christians, I think it’s just absolutely a horrible story.	0
But I’m talking about radical Islamic terrorism.	0
I will solve it far better than anybody else running.	0
Let’s talk about nuclear issues because you talked about this in a really interesting article in The New York Times.	0
One of the very, very big issues.	0
I think maybe the biggest issue of our time.	0
That’s what you said to The New York Times.	0
You said you worried about the proliferation of nuclear weapons…	0
Right.	0
… the most.	0
You also said, though, that you might support Japan and South Korea developing nuclear weapons of their own.	0
Isn’t that completely contradictory?	0
No, not at all.	0
Look, you have North Korea has nuclear weapons.	0
And he doesn’t have a carrier yet but he has got nuclear weapons.	0
He soon will have.	0
We don’t want to pull the trigger.	0
We’re just — you know, we have a president, frankly, that doesn’t — nobody is afraid of our president.	0
Nobody respects our president.	0
You take a look at what’s going on throughout the world.	0
It’s not the country that it was.	0
But if you’re concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn’t that proliferation?	0
No, no.	0
We owe $19 $trillion, we have another $2 trillion because of the very, very bad omnibus budget that was just signed.	0
It’s a disgrace, which gives everything that Obama wanted.	0
We get nothing.	0
They get everything.	0
So that’s going to be $21 trillion.	0
We are supporting nations now, militarily, we are supporting nations like Saudi Arabia which was making during the good oil days which was a year ago, now they’re making less but still a lot, $1 billion a day.	0
We are supporting them, militarily, and pay us a fraction, a fraction of what they should be paying us and of the cost.	0
We are supporting Japan.	0
Most people didn’t even know that.	0
Most people didn’t know that we are taking care of Japan’s military needs.	0
We’re supporting…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Excuse me, excuse me, we’re supporting Germany.	0
We’re supporting South Korea.	0
I order thousands of television sets because I am in the real estate business, you know, in my other life, OK.	0
It has been a U.S. policy for decades to prevent Japan from getting a nuclear weapon.	0
That might be policy, but maybe…	0
South Korea as well.	0
Can I be honest are you?	0
Maybe it’s going to have to be time to change, because so many people, you have Pakistan has it, you have China has it.	0
You have so many other countries are now having it…	0
So some proliferation is OK?	0
No, no, not proliferation.	0
I hate nuclear more than any.	0
My uncle was a professor was at MIT, used to (AUDIO GAP) nuclear, he used to tell me about the problem.	0
But that’s contradictory about Japan and South Korea.	0
(AUDIO GAP) Iran is going to have it very — within…	0
But that’s proliferation.	0
Excuse me, one of the dumbest I’ve ever seen signed ever, ever, ever by anybody, Iran is going to have it within 10 years.	0
Iran is going to have it.	0
I thought it was a very good interview in The New York Times.	0
So you have no problem with Japan and South Korea having…	0
I thought…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
… nuclear weapons.	0
At some point we have to say, you know what, we’re better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we’re better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have…	0
Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?	0
Saudi Arabia, absolutely.	0
You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?	0
No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us.	0
Here’s the thing, with Japan, they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves.	0
So if you said, Japan, yes, it’s fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too?	0
Can I be honest with you?	0
It’s going to happen, anyway.	0
It’s going to happen anyway.	0
It’s only a question of time.	0
They’re going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely.	0
But you have so many countries already, China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia, you have so many countries right now that have them.	0
Now, wouldn’t you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?	0
And they do have them.	0
They absolutely have them.	0
They can’t — they have no carrier system yet but they will very soon.	0
Wouldn’t you rather have Japan, perhaps, they’re over there, they’re very close, they’re very fearful of North Korea, and we’re supposed to protect.	0
So you’re saying you don’t want more nuclear weapons in the world but you’re OK with Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?	0
I don’t want more nuclear weapons.	0
I think that — you know, when I hear Obama get up and say the biggest threat to the world today is global warming, I say, is this guy kidding?	1
The only global warming — the only global warming I’m worried about is nuclear global warming because that’s the single biggest threat.	0
So it’s not that I’m a fan — we can’t afford it anymore.	0
We’re sitting on a tremendous bubble.	0
We’re going to be — again, $21 trillion.	0
We don’t have money.	0
So you have no security concerns…	0
We’re using all of the money…	0
… about Japan or South Korea getting nuclear weapons?	0
Anderson, when you see all of the money that our country is spending on military, we’re not spending it for ourselves; we’re protecting all of these nations all over the world.	0
We can’t afford to do it anymore.	0
But isn’t there benefit for the United States in having a secure Europe.	0
Isn’t there benefit for the United States in having a secure Asia.	0
There’s a benefit, but not big enough to bankrupt and destroy the United States, because that’s what’s happening.	0
We can’t afford it.	0
It’s very simple.	0
Now, I would rather see Japan having some form of defense, and maybe even offense, against North Korea.	0
Because we’re not pulling the trigger.	0
The bottom line on North Korea is china, if they wanted to, they’re a tremendous supplier of North Korea.	0
They have tremendous power over North Korea.	0
If they wanted to, if they weren’t toying with us, Anderson, China would be the one that would get in and could make a deal in one day, okay…	0
I want to bring into the audience just a moment.	0
Just a last question before we do.	0
I’ve got to ask you about this back and forth between you and Senator Cruz about wives.	0
After saying that you were going to spill the beans about Heidi Cruz, you retweeted an unflattering picture of her next to a picture of your wife.	0
I thought it was a nice picture of Heidi.	0
I thought it was fine.	0
Come on.	0
I thought it was fine.	0
She’s a pretty woman.	0
You’re running for president of the United States.	0
Excuse me, I didn’t start it.	0
I didn’t start it.	0
But, sir, with all due respect, that’s the argument of 5-year-old.	0
No, it’s not.	0
The argument of a 5-year-old is he started it.	0
You would say that.	0
That’s the problem with our country.	0
Every parent knows a kid who says he started it.	0
That’s not a 5-year-old.	0
Excuse.	0
No, no, no.	0
That’s the problem.	0
Exactly that thinking is the problem this country has.	0
I did not start this.	0
He sent out a picture and he knew very well it was a picture…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
He didn’t send out a picture.	0
It was an anti-Trump super PAC sent out.	0
Anderson, it was a cover story of a picture taken by Antoine Verglas, one of the great photographers of the world, by the way.	0
My wife was a very, very successful model, like one of the most.	0
A very successful model of course.	0
It was a picture for the cover of “GQ,” which is a decent — which is a very good magazine.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
It wasn’t even a pro-Cruz super PAC; it was an anti-Trump super PAC.	0
Excuse me, they were Romney people.	0
Romney is, you know, very embarrassed that he did so badly four years ago.	0
The guy choked like a dog and lost an election…	0
Do you have proof that he sent it out?	0
No, everybody knows he sent it out.	0
He knew the people in the super PAC.	0
He knew — I would be willing to bet he wrote the phrase.	0
You know, this is — would you like to have this as your first lady?	0
And a lot of people said, yes, actually, if you want to know the truth.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
But she was a magnificent model.	0
She took a picture with one of the great photographers of the world.	0
They put it on “GQ.”  All of a sudden we see this picture going all over Utah just before the election.	0
And by the way, when he said, “We had a big day, we won Utah.”  Excuse me, I won Arizona with far more delegates, and as you probably saw, 25 minutes ago, so maybe you didn’t see it, the vote was just counted in Missouri and I won Missouri, too.	0
Congratulations.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Picked up another 12 or 13 delegates.	0
Your wife is lovely, she’s very intelligent.	0
Heidi Cruz, I haven’t interviewed her — she seems like a very intelligent, very accomplished person as well.	0
Can you just leave wives out of this?	0
Absolutely.	0
I’d like to do it.	0
But why retweet — why retweet somebody?	0
I would love to do it.	0
I really would rather talk about nuclear proliferation.	0
It’s a slightly more important subject.	0
You act as if retweeting is not an endorsement.	0
Let me just tell you something, I would love to do it.	0
I didn’t send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah.	0
He did.	0
He knew about it.	0
It was his people, who were his friends.	0
It was a PAC that’s…	0
Couldn’t you just let it go, though?	0
Do you have to retweet some random person sending you…	0
No, I don’t let things go so easy.	0
And let me tell you something.	0
I don’t let the — if I were running the country, I wouldn’t have people taking advantage of the United States in trade and in every other way, either.	0
Believe me, I wouldn’t have China walking away with trade deficits of $505 billion a year.	0
I wouldn’t have Mexico laughing at us how stupid we are with trade deals, and at the border.	0
I wouldn’t let Japan get away what they’re doing with, you know, devaluation of the yen.	0
China big league devaluation.	0
No, I — when somebody…	0
Can you say tonight, though, no more such about wives?	0
Oh, absolutely.	0
I don’t want to talk about that.	0
It’s ridiculous to be talking about that.	0
All right, let’s go to the audience.	0
I want you to meet retired Lieutenant Brian Murphy.	0
He as first the officer to report to the Sikh temple massacre in Oak Creek, and was shot 15 times.	0
His fellow officer, who is standing next to him, Sam Lenda…	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Sam Lenda took out…	0
Great.	0
His fellow officer standing next to him, Sam Lenda, took out the shooter that day, is also with us.	0
We wanted to just first of all take a moment to thank both of them for their service and their actions.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Brian has a question for you tonight.	0
He says he’s — he likes Governor Kasich but he’s still undecided — so Brian.	0
Good evening, Mr. Trump.	0
I have a question.	0
In light of the Brussels and Paris attacks one of the quickest knee-jerk reactions is a backlash against specific minority religious groups.	0
This, in turn, brings about things that cause damage all over.	0
In Milwaukee, you heard about the Sikh temple shooting.	0
Six people were killed.	0
99 percent of the men in the United States who wear turbans are actually Sikh and not Muslim.	0
How would you suggest we help educate the public and not alienate these groups and, at the same time, how do we protect the constitutional rights of minority groups like the Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, and Jews, while still addressing radical Islamization?	0
Well, Brian, thank you for the question.	0
We have a tremendous problem with radical Islam whether we like it or we don’t.	0
We have a president who won’t talk about it.	0
I mean, Ted was saying the same thing.	0
We have a president who won’t talk about it.	0
Why he won’t talk about, perhaps only he knows, but it’s a disgrace what’s going on.	0
We have a serious, serious problem, and when I called for a temporary ban I thought that was a very bad thing for me to do politically, but I felt I should do it.	0
And, I didn’t know that I would go up in the polls opposed to down.	0
I did that because I really felt there had to be something done.	0
That was after the horrible San Bernardino, California situation.	0
After, obviously, Paris which was terrible.	0
You know, we talk about Paris with the gun-free zones, we talk about Paris with their strong gun laws, by the way.	0
Nobody had guns except for the bad guys.	0
If we would have had guns on the other side going, in terms of Second Amendment having to do, if bullets were — same thing with San Bernardino.	0
If bullets were going in the opposite direction, you wouldn’t have had the problems in those two places, that I can tell you.	0
So, I think we have to be extremely careful with our Second Amendment, and we have to cherish our Second Amendment.	0
Very important.	0
But, I would say this, when I called for the temporary banning, we have to look at it.	0
We have a serious problem, I think you’ll admit that, Brian.	0
We have a very, very serious problem with radical Islam, and if we don’t want to discuss it, and if we don’t want to look at it, we’re never going to solve the problem.	0
We have to be extremely strong with ISIS.	0
We have to wipe ISIS off the face of the Earth so fast and so violently we have no choice.	0
We have no choice.	0
And, I was against the war in Iraq.	0
OK?	0
I am not a fast trigger.	0
I’m exactly the opposite of that.	0
We should have never gone in, it destabilized the Middle East.	0
But, I will tell you this, we got out.	0
Obama got us out very badly.	0
Instead of leaving some troops, instead of giving a date, instead of, you know, with the exact time, I would say this though — we have no choice but to look at that.	0
We have to be very, very vigilant.	0
Very smart, and frankly, Brian, we have to be very tough because it’s only going to get worse.	0
Thousands of people are being allowed into this country over short periods of time coming supposedly from Syria.	0
We have no idea who they are, we have no idea where is their paperwork.	0
They have no paperwork; they have no identification.	0
They’re coming into  this country and it’s going to be a big, big problem.	0
The other, though, part of Lieutenant Murphy’s question was about protecting the rights of minority groups, of Muslims, or Sikhs, of Jews, and others inside the United States…	0
…  I want to do that also, and I do want to do that, but I at the same time we have to recognize we have a serious problem.	0
Let me follow up on that.	0
You said you agreed, I think you said you agreed, with Senator Ted Cruz’s proposal in the wake of the Brussels attack that law enforcement should, quote, “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” I talked to him about this in the last hour.	0
Bill Bratton, Commissioner, the Chief of Police…	0
…  Who I like very much…	0
…  In your home city.	0
Chief of Police under Giuliani, as well as now de Blasio, again — out in L.A.	0
He said about Ted Cruz’s proposal, “we do not patrol and secure neighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion.” Is he wrong?	0
I think we have to be extremely vigilant in those areas, we have to look very seriously at the Mosques.	0
Lots of things happening in the Mosques, that’s been proven.	0
You look at what’s going on in Paris where Mosques are being closed, OK?	0
And, we have to look very, very seriously.	0
There’s a lot of Muslims in America who hear that, saying we got to look seriously at the Mosques…	0
…  Let me just tell you something, in San Bernadino people know what was going on.	0
These two people — probably became radicalized through her.	0
Who knows?	0
Frankly, right now, it doesn’t matter.	0
But, these two people want to kill their co-workers, et cetera, et cetera, in their apartment, or their house.	0
In their place where they lived, they had bombs all over the apartment…	0
…  Do you trust…	0
…  Excuse me — they had bombs on the floor.	0
Many people saw this.	0
Many, many people.	0
Muslims living with them in the same area.	0
They saw that house, they saw that.	0
One didn’t want to turn them in.	0
He said I don’t know turn them in because I don’t want to be accused of racial profiling.	0
He saw bombs all over the apartment, OK?	0
It’s just an excuse…	0
…  Do you trust Muslims in America?	0
…  Do I what?	0
Trust Muslims in America?	0
Many of them I do.	0
Many of them I do, and some, I guess, we don’t.	0
Some, I guess, we don’t.	0
We have a problem, and we can try and be very politically correct and pretend we don’t have a problem, but, Anderson, we have a major, major problem.	0
This is, in a sense, this is a war…	0
…  So, special patrols in Muslim neighborhoods…	0
… You know, nobody wants to call it a war — excuse me.	0
Nobody wants to call it a war.	0
It’s a war.	0
There’s a war.	0
The difference is it’s not like you’re fighting Germany or Japan where they have a uniform, we have a uniform, everybody has a different uniform.	0
We don’t know where these people are.	0
I want you to meet Jeff Johns.	0
He’s a financial consultant.	0
He said he is on the Trump train as of this point.	0
I like him.	0
I like him very much.	0
I knew you would.	0
I like him.	0
Thank you for coming to the great city of Milwaukee.	0
Thank you, Jeff.	0
Mr. Trump, you have a high net worth in the billions of dollars but many people don’t think that you’re a successful businessman.	0
They refer to your inherited wealth and how it’s just a track that pays the average market index.	0
Mr. Trump, what do you say to those people that do not think that you’re a successful businessman?	0
Yes, I love the question because it’s such lies.	0
I started off in Brooklyn.	0
My father was a builder in Brooklyn.	0
Brooklyn had not a lot of value.	0
Brooklyn was not a great place to be.	0
I wanted to always go into Manhattan.	0
My father, my first deal and my first loan was $1 million from my father which was a loan, I had to pay him back.	0
I did numerous deals in Manhattan.	0
My father said, don’t go into Manhattan, it’s not our territory, we can’t do that, it’s not for us.	0
I started off with a very, very small amount of money.	0
And by the way, when my father passed away, remember, I have four — I have a total of five in my family.	0
So we have brothers, sisters, split.	0
And when my father died, by that time I had already built a great fortune and my father didn’t leave a great fortune.	0
It was Brooklyn and Queens real estate and it wasn’t a great fortune.	0
But now what they do is they build it up like, oh, he left Donald money.	0
I started off — and you understand, you know the true answer because you’re somebody that understands me and you understand where it started.	0
I started off with $1 million and now I’m worth over $10 billion.	0
And I filed my papers with the election committees, with the federal election, and people in your world, in your profession, are down there, or have been down there all the time and they can’t believe how great those papers are.	0
Very little debt.	0
Some of the greatest assets in the world.	0
Some of the greatest assets in the world.	0
And, very importantly, tremendous cash flow.	0
And I don’t say that in a bragging way.	0
I say that because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0
And I want to say this, before my father died, he said, everything Donald touches turns to gold.	0
It’s absolutely — he was so proud of me.	0
But I borrowed very little money from my father.	0
What I did borrow and the thing that really helped me with my father was his knowledge.	0
He was an excellent negotiator.	0
He was an excellent builder.	0
But he built in Brooklyn and Queens, there wasn’t that much money in Brooklyn and Queens.	0
A lot of other candidates have released tax returns.	0
You say you won’t release them because you’re being audited.	0
There are some people who doubt you’re even being audited or have been audited as much as…	0
Oh, I can give you a letter for that.	0
Would you like a letter?	0
I’ll give you…	0
Can you?	0
I’ll give it to you, sure, absolutely.	0
Because some people have raised that as a doubt.	0
And only a fool would give a tax return…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
So you can offer evidence that you are being audited or have been audited like you say?	0
A hundred percent.	0
I’ll give you a letter from the biggest firm in Washington that does my work for me.	0
All right.	0
OK?	0
I want you to meet Robert Kitelinger.	0
He’s retired from the U.S. Army after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.	0
He’s now a student at Marquette University…	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Robert?	0
Good evening, Mr. Trump.	0
In your opinion, what are the top three functions of the United States government?	0
Say it again?	0
In your opinion, what are the top three functions of the United States government?	0
Well, the greatest function of all by far is security for our nation.	0
I would also say health care, I would also say education.	0
I mean, there are many, many things, but I would say the top three are security, security, security.	0
We have to have security for our country so that we can continue to exist as a country.	0
We are in danger.	0
Thousands and thousands of people are infiltrating our country.	0
We don’t know who they are.	0
There’s a very vicious world.	0
We’re living in a very vicious world and we’re doing something that is against a lot of very smart people’s wishes.	0
I can tell you, it’s totally against my wishes.	0
So top three, you’re saying, security.	0
Security.	0
I say all top three are security, but health care, education, would be probably three that would be top.	0
And then you can go on from there.	0
But the military and the secure country, so that we have a country.	0
Believe me, we’ve never been in a position, in my opinion, where our country is so vulnerable.	0
Our military is being eaten away.	0
When General Odierno left recently, a year ago, I was watching him on maybe your show, one of the shows, and he said that the United States Army, the United States military forces have never been so — and I think he used the word depleted.	0
But basically he said they’re exhausted.	0
So just to follow-up, though…	0
And that’s a pretty — that’s a pretty sad commentary.	0
And honestly, even though he was retiring at the time — and I had a lot of respect for him, good man, but even though he was leaving at the time, people shouldn’t say that because you’re giving the enemy ideas.	0
But if I get in, our military will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before.	0
It’s the cheapest thing we can do.	0
So in terms of federal government role, you’re saying security, but you also say health care and education should be provided by the federal government?	0
Well, those are two of the things.	0
Yes, sure.	0
I mean, there are obviously many things, housing, providing great neighborhoods…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Aren’t you against the federal government’s involvement in education?	0
don’t you want it to devolve to states?	0
I want it to go to state, yes.	0
Absolutely.	0
I want — right now…	0
So that’s not part of what the federal government’s…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
The federal government, but the concept of the country is the concept that we have to have education within the country, and we have to get rid of common core and it should be brought to the state level.	0
And federal health care run by the federal government?	0
Health care — we need health care for our people.	0
We need a good — Obamacare is a disaster.	0
It’s proven to be…	0
But is that something the federal government should be doing?	0
The government can lead it, but it should be privately done.	0
It should be privately done.	0
So that health care — in my opinion, we should probably have — we have to have private health care.	0
We don’t have competition in health care.	0
The problem that we have in our country is we don’t have competition.	0
It’s made because the politicians — by the way, I’m self-funding.	1
I am self-funding.	0
So the health care companies aren’t taking care of me.	0
But they’re taking care of everyone else.	0
Wait one second.	0
We don’t have — we don’t have bidding.	0
We don’t have competition in health care.	0
And it’s a disaster.	0
Obamacare, if you take a look at your premiums, they’re going up 35 percent, 45 percent, 55 percent, and the deductibles are so high, you’ll never get to use it.	0
You always say you’re self-funding.	0
How much do you think your campaign has cost — in the past you said $25 million.	0
I can tell you, I’d say I’m in right now for — now, I’m in for about $35 million right now.	0
Okay.	0
We take the small loans, the people that send $17.50, or $250, even $1,000…	0
And you solicit those on your website.	0
No, I sell hats and shirts and…	0
No, but you do solicit donations on your website?	0
No, I don’t really think so.	0
Yes, you do.	0
You have two spots (ph), where you do.	0
Okay, whatever.	0
Whatever.	0
It’s peanuts.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
It’s not peanuts; it’s $7 million — it’s a lot of money.	0
I’ll tell you what, what I’ve done is I’m in for about $35 million.	0
It’s about a third of your campaign is funded by other people.	0
No it’s not.	0
No, it’s not, not a third.	0
Whatever the hats are, they also cost something.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Well, according to the FTC you’ve raised more than, I think, $7 million last time I checked from individual donations.	0
Let me put it differently.	0
I am not soliciting money from insurance companies and from lumber companies and from banks and from — if I did, I would have made Jeb Bush look like a baby.	0
I have turned down more $10 million offers.	0
Just the other night, I’m in Florida, and a very, very rich friend of mine comes up, Donald, I’d like to give you $10 million, I’ll give you anything…	0
You’ve actually been loaning your campaign a lot of money.	0
Are you going to have your campaign pay you back?	0
I doubt it.	0
But it just seems to be the way it’s done.	0
But that’s a possibility?	0
I don’t know — can I be honest?	0
I never even thought about it.	0
I never even thought about it.	0
Okay.	0
Just seems to me the way the lawyers set it up.	0
But I am in right now, I put in my money, about $35 million.	0
I think in terms of small donations, I think we’ve received $6 million up until this point.	0
I think I saw $7 million.	0
Excuse me.	0
A lot of that is the selling of merchandise and things like that.	0
I want to…	0
There’s no influence over me.	0
It’s not like the banks are giving me money and I’m going to do favors for the banks.	0
You look at Ted Cruz, the banks are giving him a lot of money.	0
The oil and gas are giving him a lot of money.	0
A lot of people are giving him a lot of money.	0
And by the way super PACs are a disaster, and they’re a disaster waiting to happen, folks, and if they’re not gotten rid of, it’s only going to get worse.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I want to introduce you to Amelia Roll (ph).	0
She’s a journalism student the University of Wisconsin.	0
She says her first choice is Senator Cruz, but you’re her second pick.	0
Oh, that’s nice.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Here’s your chance to win her over — Amelia.	0
Mr. Trump, thank you so much for being here tonight.	0
Thank you.	0
Mr. Trump, in a recent interview with the Washington Post, you said that the U.S. should become a diminishing presence in NATO.	0
Absolutely.	0
Why do you think that the U.S. should start to withdraw their world presence from NATO, and what would you change about the organization so that we could remain involved?	0
Okay, I did two basic and very large interviews recently.	0
I did the New York Times, which treated me unbelievably fairly.	0
And there was a front-page story on Sunday or — I think, and It was a great story.	0
And part of it was NATO — and the other was the Washington Post.	0
I think you talked to them longer than any other candidate, by the way, on the Republican side.	0
I spoke to the Times?	0
Yes.	0
Well, I spoke to them a long time.	0
David, he’s a very talented writer actually.	0
And they treated me very fairly.	0
I also did the Washington Post, where I said very similar things, and very similar things about NATO.	0
Let me tell you, NATO is obsolete.	0
It was 67 years, or it’s over 60 years old.	0
It is — many countries, doesn’t cover terrorism, okay?	0
it covers the Soviet Union which is no longer in existence.	0
And NATO has to either be rejiggered, changed for the better.	0
I’m not saying — the other thing that’s bad about NATO, we’re paying too much.	0
We’re spending a tremendous — billions and billions of dollars on NATO.	0
You’re saying it’s obsolete, though.	0
You have now Vladimir Putin invade invading Crimea, annexing part of Ukraine — annexing Crimea.	0
Let me tell you about Ukraine.	0
First of all…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
There a lot of people who believe NATO is more important…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
You have countries that surround Ukraine.	0
They don’t talk.	0
They don’t seem to have a problem.	0
I’m not saying go in.	0
I’d say be very strong, you can be strong without necessarily even being (INAUDIBLE) or the money we spend.	0
The money we spend is astronomical on NATO.	0
Okay?	0
The Ukraine —	0
You really think NATO is obsolete?	0
I think it’s largely obsolete, yes.	0
It’s got to be changed.	0
It’s got to be — you don’t talk about terror.	0
Our single biggest threat right now is terror, okay?	0
Now that’s an amorphous term, but it’s terror.	0
Our single biggest threat —	0
So you would like to see an organization revamped, either NATO —	0
Either revamped – NATO, now if you do that, you’re going to have to obviously have to add different nations in because you have nations that aren’t in NATO that are very much into the world of terror.	0
Both in terms of causing it and receiving it.	0
So you’d probably have to either start something or you have to do something.	0
When you look at Brussels, hey, look.	0
You remember a couple of months ago, I made a statement about Brussels.	0
I said it’s a hell hole.	0
That’s because it’s a financial, very big  financial capital.	0
Many of my friends are there.	0
They know exactly what’s going on.	0
I haven’t been there in many years.	0
I was there.	0
It was a beautiful city.	0
Now it’s not good.	0
And I said it was a hell hole.	0
“The New York Times” attacked me rather viciously for calling a place a hell hole.	0
Two months later, we had the attack, and it turned out I was right.	0
It’s a hell hole.	0
And on Twitter and all over the place, they’re saying Trump was right, Trump was right.	0
I understand this stuff.	0
I mean, I really do understand this stuff.	0
NATO is obsolete.	0
Now, that doesn’t mean it can’t be rejiggered and it can’t be fixed and made good or —	0
And for you that’s —	0
It’s possible —	0
— a financial component that when you talk about —	0
We’re paying too much!	0
You have countries in NATO, I think it’s 28 countries – you have countries in NATO that are getting a free ride and it’s unfair, it’s very unfair.	0
The United States cannot afford to be the policemen of the world anymore, folks.	0
We have to rebuild our own country.	0
We have to stop with this stuff.	0
You have as an example, Ukraine.	0
You don’t have Germany talking about Ukraine.	0
You don’t have many of the countries in NATO talking about — it’s always us.	0
We’re always the first one out.	0
We have very big problems in our country.	0
Very, very big problems.	0
NATO has to be either changed, or we have to do something.	0
And we shouldn’t be paying most of the course of NATO because it’s unfair – it’s unfair to our taxpayers and to our people.	0
We’ve got to – we’ve got to take a quick break.	0
We’ll have more with Donald Trump right after the short break when our 360 Republican Town Hall continues from the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
And, welcome back.	0
We’re talking to Donald Trump.	0
A week before the Wisconsin primary, voters asking the Republican candidates the questions that matter to them, looking for answers to help them decide.	0
Before we go back to the audience, I want to ask you a question I asked to Senator Cruz as well.	0
more than six months ago you pledged to support the Republican nominee, whoever that may be.	0
A lot has changed since then.	0
It sounded, when I was pressing Senator Cruz on it, sounded like he was saying he was saying he’d have a hard time supporting somebody who went after his wife.	1
Honestly, he doesn’t have to support me.	0
I’m not asking for his support.	0
I want the people’s support.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Do you continue to pledge whoever the Republican nominee is?	0
No.	0
I don’t anymore.	0
You don’t?	0
No, we’ll see who it is.	0
You won’t promise to support the Republican nominee?	0
He was essentially saying the same thing.	0
Let me just tell you, he doesn’t have to support me.	0
I have tremendous support right now from the people.	0
I’m way over two million votes more than him.	0
I have many, many, more delegates than him.	0
Like, many, many more delegates.	0
As I said before, he was talking about his great victory the night Utah — well, I won Arizona.	0
Many more delegates.	0
Many, many more delegates.	0
I don’t really want him to do something he’s not comfortable with.	0
Just like I can’t imagine Jeb Bush — look, I beat these people badly.	0
I beat Jeb Bush.	0
I beat the governor of this state, the governor of this state came in, he was favored to win.	0
He was at 22 points.	0
Then he said something bad about me and I hit him very hard, and he went boom, and he left the race.	0
He was very early…	0
…Just so I’m clear…	0
I don’t want to make people uncomfortable.	0
I don’t need their support.	0
Now, maybe it will be a negative, maybe it won’t.	0
So, the pledge you took is null and void.	0
The idea of supporting whoever…	0
…  I have defeated…	0
…  the Republican nominee is, you say you will no longer guarantee you will support the Republican nominee…	0
…  I have been treated very unfairly.	0
I won the state of Missouri, right?	0
No, I have.	0
Aww, Cruz people.	0
I’ve been treated very unfairly.	0
Unfairly by?	0
I’ll give you an example.	0
Who?	0
I think by, basically, the RNC, the Republican party, the establishment.	0
You have a guy like Mitt Romney who lost miserably, who did a terrible job.	0
He was a horrible, horrible campaign.	0
The last month of that — I helped him.	0
I raised him a million dollars…	0
…  Do you think the RNC is plotting to take this away from you at the convention?	0
I don’t know, I don’t know.	0
I mean, we’ll see what happens, but I think you’d have a lot of very upset people if that happened.	0
Just so you understand, when Romney came out against me he ran one of the worst races in the history of presidential politics.	0
He ought to sit back and root for us instead of being a negative force.	0
And, we have, others also.	0
I’m bringing millions — the biggest story in all of politics worldwide right now — and I think you might agree to this, is what’s happened.	0
Millions of people are coming in and voting, in all fairness, for me.	0
And, watching, and being involved in the process.	0
And, watching all of this.	0
Your ratings tonight will be excellent, right?	0
The debate you had where 23 million people, I don’t want to say this tragedy, I’m just telling you, if I wasn’t in it you would have had, what?	0
Four million people…	0
…  In the off chance that you’re not the Republican nominee, what would go into your decision of whether or not you would support…	0
…  Well, I’ll look at it.	0
I’ll see who it is.	0
I mean, I’m not looking to hurt anybody.	0
I love the Republican party as…	0
…  If it’s Senator Ted Cruz, would you support him…	0
…  Look, here’s my thing on Cruz.	0
A lot of nasty things have been said.	0
I’m a very honorably guy, and I’m a very honest guy.	0
I don’t do — I would have never done what he did to Ben Carson who, by the way, endorsed me.	0
I would have never gone to Iowa and said, “Ben Carson has left the race”.	0
He is gone, 100 percent, vote for me.	0
And they usher people into the caucus, and they try and get them to vote for Ted Cruz.	0
A lot of people left Ben Carson.	0
Ben Carson is an honorable guy.	0
That was a terrible thing to do.	0
There were other terrible things to do.	0
And I — honestly, I watched him tonight with you, and I  watched how tormented he was when you asked him that question.	0
I don’t want to have him torment.	0
I don’t want to have him be tormented.	0
Let me just tell you, I don’t want his support.	0
I don’t need his support.	0
I want him to be comfortable.	0
Now, if he wants to support me, that would be wonderful because I think I’m going to win.	0
But let me just tell you.	0
I watched him, you know, skirt around like any politician would.	0
Skirt around the issue.	0
I don’t want to make people like Jeb Bush, like Ted Cruz, like Governor Walker — I mean, Governor Walker, I hit him very hard after he hit me.	0
But I hit him very hard and drove him out of the race.	0
I drove Jeb Bush out of the race.	0
I drove Rand Paul out of the race.	0
I understand why they don’t like me.	0
And I don’t want people that — I don’t want people to do something against their will, Anderson.	0
I could see that he was having a hard time with a very simple question that you asked him.	0
Would you support, well, I think I’m going to win.	0
OK.	0
He doesn’t have to do it.	0
He doesn’t have to support me.	0
I really don’t believe I need his support.	0
I’d love to have everybody’s support.	0
You know what, I’m a unifier.	0
Believe it or not, I’m a unifier.	0
And you will see that.	0
Someday you will see that.	0
If there was a contested convention, and you didn’t get the nomination, and someone else was brought in, a Paul Ryan, for instance, would you support him?	0
Well, let me explain.	0
See, he was very nice.	0
He called me the other day, last week, and he was very nice.	0
But then I read reports that he’s having meetings with people about, you know, some clandestine things.	0
Let’s see what happens.	0
But he was very nice when he called.	0
And I assume he was being straight with me.	0
I hope he was being straight with me because what he said was very appropriate.	0
I’m the front-runner by a lot.	0
I’m beating Ted Cruz by millions of votes.	0
Millions of votes.	0
The Republican Party is doing — it’s a phenomena.	0
And this was not going to that with the Republican Party.	0
People that never voted before, Democrats and independents, are pouring in and voting for me.	0
In Louisiana, you won…	0
I won.	0
But Ted Cruz got…	0
To show you how corrupt the system is…	0
… got more delegates.	0
You threatened to sue.	0
I won — well, I’m going to see.	0
I mean, I never heard of that before.	0
You know, I’m a very — I’m an American.	0
If you win an election, you’re supposed to…	0
But isn’t that just sour grapes?	0
Didn’t he just have…	0
No.	0
He just outworked you on the ground in getting delegates?	0
No.	0
Now let me tell you what’s next.	0
No, no.	0
Look, in Missouri, I just — it was just announced I won.	0
I figured, in fact, they actually found that after a tabulation that I got 300 and some odd more votes than I had the first time, which is, you know, after two weeks or three weeks of tabulation, which gives me another 12 or 13 delegates.	0
It was just announced a little while ago just before I went on the air.	0
I will say this, Louisiana, I went to Louisiana.	0
I have a great relationship with the people of Louisiana.	0
They’re great people.	0
I won the election.	0
I was down there the night before.	0
We had an airplane hangar, you wouldn’t believe it, packed with people screaming.	0
I won the election.	0
And then it’s all about the delegates.	0
So I won.	0
And then I found out that I got 10 votes less  — 10 delegates less than the guy who lost.	0
I beat him rather easily.	0
But those are the rules.	0
I mean, his campaign had a better ground game in Louisiana.	0
No, I don’t know what rules — OK, I don’t know, I don’t think — I don’t call it a ground game.	0
I call it bad politics.	0
They were able to get more delegates.	0
I call it bad politics.	0
When somebody goes in and wins the election and gets less delegates than the guy that lost, I don’t think that’s right.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
All right.	0
I want you to meet Jim Zaiser, he’s the CEO of a valve manufacturing company that has been in the family for three generations.	0
He says he’s undecided.	0
He’s leaning in your favor.	0
Thank you.	0
That’s what I like to hear.	0
Hello, Mr. Trump.	0
As a world leader, any leader, you need compassion and a willingness to make compromises.	0
Can you give me an example of a time you have learned from your behavior and changed the way you have done something going forward?	0
Yes.	0
I am somebody — Jim, thank you.	0
I am somebody that believes in flexibility.	0
And if you notice, Ted Cruz and mostly him, he says he will change, he will negotiate, he will this.	0
Look, you don’t have to stand on the floor of the United States Senate for a day-and-a-half and rant and rave while all the other senators are laughing at you, and by the way, not endorsing him.	0
Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected men in the Senate, endorsed me, and frankly — I mean, and he’s a great man.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And by the way, Jeff Sessions is a great man with great, great knowledge.	0
And Ted Cruz thought he was going to get that endorsement.	0
He would speak about Jeff Sessions all the time, then Jeff Sessions came out and endorsed me.	0
You need flexibility, and I talk about it all the time.	0
You need to be able to negotiate great deals.	0
You know, it’s not all about signing  executive orders because this is something that came in — that wasn’t the way our founders thought that this country was going to win.	0
You have to get — now, I’ll make great deals.	0
I’ll make conservative deals.	0
I’m going to make wonderful deals but you have to do it the old-fashioned way like Ronald Reagan did with Tip O’Neill.	0
Do you have a specific, though, for him on — a specific example that you changed your behavior, changed the way you’ve done something going forward, or learned from something you’ve done that you didn’t like the way it turned out?	0
Well, I think — yeah, I mean, I have many, many things that I’ve done.	0
I have many things that I’ve changed course on.	0
I mean, I’ve changed course on many, many things.	0
I was not…	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Actually, I have.	0
Any specifics?	0
Well, I mean, you could say, I am — as you know, I’m pro-life, and I was originally pro-choice.	0
I will say this, that as a developer and as a businessman I’m not sure I was ever even asked the question, are you pro-life, pro-choice?	0
And it was not something that as one of magazines recently said, Donald Trump is a world-class businessman.	0
He was never asked those questions before.	0
But you know, if I was asked those questions years ago it’s something I never really gave much though to.	0
But I’ve made certain changes.	0
I have evolved.	0
I talk about evolving all the time.	0
I want to…	0
And by the way, you know who else evolved, is Ronald Reagan evolved.	0
Because Ronald Reagan signed one of the toughest abortion laws in favor of abortion in California that had been signed in many, many years.	0
And yet has a great president and a — pretty conservative — he wasn’t very conservative, but he was a pretty conservative president.	0
You said on the radio right here in Wisconsin the other day that you do apologize and you believe in apologizing.	0
When was the last time you actually apologized for something?	0
Oh, wow.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
No, I do — I don’t know — I’ll think.	0
Can I think?	0
But look, I do believe in apologizing, if you’re wrong.	0
But if you’re not wrong, I don’t believe in apologizing.	0
For instance, I could have apologized, you brought up — we started this with Corey, my campaign manager.	0
Will you apologize.	0
I said, apologize for what?	0
I see the tape.	0
Apologize for what?	0
I’ve love to apologize.	0
It would be so much easier.	0
Apologize, Corey, you’re fired…	0
But you don’t know any specific examples that you’ve apologized, ever.	0
Yes, I mean — apologized — I apologized to my mother years ago for using foul language.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion.	0
She’s always saying “Darling, be more presidential.”	0
She told me she’s talked to you about that.	0
No, she does, because she thinks I’m very presidential.	0
The last debate — and by the way, Cruz talked about I don’t want to — I debated this guy like 112 (ph) times.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
She didn’t like you reusing the word, a dirty word, or a bad word I guess — I sound like a 12-year-old…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
… that somebody in your audience shouted out and you repeated.	0
She didn’t like that.	0
Oh, she didn’t like that.	0
And really, it was just a repeat, but that didn’t work out too well.	0
No, she didn’t…	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Repeats don’t work either.	0
And it wasn’t horrible.	0
What is it with you, like, repeats and retweets don’t count.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Do you ever notice my biggest problems are repeats and retweets.	0
I don’t in problem with what I say; it’s when I repeat such…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Well, maybe that’s one of those things you should learn from your behavior and not retweet things.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You’re right.	0
You’re right.	0
That I agree with.	0
Some free advice.	0
That I agree with.	0
I will say this, though, my wife and Ivanka said, like, on the last debates, because the debates had been pretty rough and really I felt  I had to be rough, because it’s coming at me from all different angles.	0
Don’t forget I’ve been at the middle of the podium, the middle of the stage for every single debate.	0
I’ve enjoyed debate — I never debated…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Cruz has challenged you to debate him.	0
Give me a break.	0
The guy has challenged me – he’s lost every debate.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
You wouldn’t debate him one on one?	0
I think we’ve had enough questions from the same people, including you — and all due respect.	0
I haven’t done a GOP debate yet, but that’s all right.	0
How many times can the same people — how many times, Anderson, can the same people ask the same question?	0
It’s just —  you get tired of it.	0
But as president you’re going to be asked the same question for four or eight years.	0
I’ve had 11 or 12 debates — wait a minute — I’ve had 11 or 12 debates with Cruz.	0
Every — Drudge, they do an online poll right after the debate, Time magazine, Slate, many groups do — I think I’ve won every single poll by a lot on debating.	0
I have nothing to prove anymore.	0
So no more debates?	0
I don’t see where it’s necessary.	0
I mean, look, you’re asking me all of these questions tonight.	0
Frankly, I think this is much better than a debate.	0
The debates, they give you 15 seconds, what would you do in terms of war and peace, okay?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Honestly, i Think this is a much better format.	0
I’m happy to keep having these conversations.	0
I don’t think it’s easier.	0
I think debating is probably easier because you’re talking so little.	0
I want to bring in.	0
Sorry…	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
So I hope you change your mind.	0
I hope you’re can agree (ph) with me.	0
Sorry, hold on.	0
Sorry, John.	0
I want you to meet John Peghill (ph).	0
Thanks very much.	0
Yes, hi, John.	0
He’s a dairy farmer.	0
He’s got 5,000 cows.	0
We have another dairy farmer asking a question for Senator Cruz earlier.	0
John said he’s leaning in your favor.	0
Still listening to the other candidates.	0
John, welcome.	0
Hi, John.	0
Mr. Trump — hi.	0
Welcome to the Cheese State.	0
Thank you.	0
A great state.	0
The question that I have — Wisconsin is an amazing state.	0
But our No.	0
1 economic driver, which is the dairy industry and the cheese industry is right behind it, is being challenged right now by having a labor force dependent on an immigration policy.	0
And we’ve got over 10,000 farms in this state.	0
And with there being such a strong economic driver, if we don’t have a strong immigration policy that will give us the opportunity to keep the ones that we have and provide a vehicle to bring new ones in from Mexico legally…	0
Legally.	0
You said the word.	0
Yes, but can you develop a policy that will give us that, give us the people that we have here to stay here and do the jobs — and create a policy that can bring people in to fill the jobs?	0
We’re down to 3.5 percent unemployment rate North of Milwaukee, so that we can’t steal any more people from someone else’s industry, because that’s what everybody’s doing at this point.	0
How do we fill the jobs, the good paying jobs?	0
How do we fill those jobs?	0
Here’s where you are, you’re in the same position as the California grape growers because they need people to come in.	0
It’s seasonal, in that case.	0
Very seasonal, less seasonal in your case, but still seasonal.	0
And, people will be able — if they can’t get people, will be able to come in legally.	0
See, you said the word.	0
Right now we have illegal immigration, we have illegals all over the country.	0
We have at least 11 million.	0
Some people think it could be 31 million, it’s somewhere in between.	0
It’s probably 12, 13, 14 — we have no idea what we’re doing.	0
If you have an industry like California grapes, like perhaps what you’re talking about in Wisconsin, we’re going to let people come in, but they’re going to come in legally.	0
They’re going to come in through a visa program and they’re going to come in legally.	0
It’s going to work out beautifully, you will not be affected.	0
We don’t want to affect businesses.	0
We want to grow businesses.	0
The other part of your question now, I think that we really have to talk about, is trade because a lot of people are sending goods over to other countries, and especially goods that can spoil like what you do.	0
They send over to other countries, and the other country refuse to accept them, and yet we accept their good without tax, without anything.	0
We are going to straighten out our trade policy so that you’re going to get a lot more business.	0
We have time for one more question from the audience.	0
This is Andy Bowen, she’s from Shorewood, and homeschools her two daughters.	0
She says she’s leaning in your favor for the primary next week.	0
Andy, welcome.	0
Thank you.	0
Hi, Andy.	0
Thank you, hi, Mr. Trump.	0
My 93-year-old father is so impressed with all of your kids.	0
That’s good.	0
Especially with your two sons.	0
And, when they’re on television being interviewed, he will often say, “Why can’t Donald Trump be more like his sons, who are so…”	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
…  I hear that.	0
I know.	0
…  who are so well spoken, and calm.	0
And, so my question to you, Mr. Trump, is could you possibly look to your sons as examples how not to be quite so reactionary?	0
And, also, congratulations on raising such fine young people…	0
…Thank you very much.	0
I think I love that question, can I be honest?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I have so many compliments on my children, and Ivanka is doing phenomenally well.	0
My boys are great Baron is a young version, I think, of Eric, frankly, because they’re very tall, and they look alike, etcetera, etcetera.	0
But, Don, and Eric, and Baron are just spectacular people, and you know?	0
I get so many compliments.	0
Ivanka, is Ivanka, you know?	0
You know Ivanka very well, you’ve had her on your show, and she’s a star.	0
She’s absolutely a start, and so supportive of me, and so supportive what I’m doing.	0
And, they do have great attitude.	0
I do, I get so many people come up to my office, and they want to have their children come up and meet me because they want their children to be like mine.	0
Do you sometimes wish you had a little bit more of what she called, “calmness”?	0
My children have a lot of drive.	0
You don’t want to see them sometimes, I will say this.	0
They’re very strong.	0
They are very — they have great heart.	0
They have great heart.	0
All of my children have a wonderful, wonderful feeling for people, they love people.	0
That’s why they want me to do what I’m doing, because they know I’d do it well.	0
They know I’ll bring the country — you know, we have the expression, “Make America Great Again”.	0
They know I will make America Great again.	0
The world isn’t going to take advantages of us anymore.	0
You look at what the world is doing to us at every level, whether it’s militarily, or in trade, or in so many other levels, the world is taking advantage of the United States and it’s driving us into literally being a third world nation.	0
Anderson, I travel all over the world, and I land at airports the likes of which you’ve never seen, whether it’s in Qatar, or Dubai, or places in China.	0
The likes of which you have never seen, and then we come home and we land at LaGuardia with potholes all over the place, or LAX, or Kennedy, or Newark, and you look at what we have and where we’ve gone.	0
It’s time to rebuild our country.	0
You just welcomed a new grandson…	0
… And I really appreciate your statement.	0
Thank you.	0
You just welcomed a new grandson…	0
I did.	0
His name is Theodore.	0
Any chance you’re going to call him Crying Ted?	0
No, I don’t think so.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I said — well, actually, isn’t Ted’s real name Raphael?	0
I think so, right?	0
Because that was one of the questions did have to ask.	0
I — it is.	0
I doesn’t matter.	0
Theodore Roosevelt is somebody Jared and Ivanka have long studied and respected, and it’s Theodore James.	0
Tough, strong, and it’s Theodore James, and that’s what they really had in mind.	0
Congratulations on that, and god bless.	0
Thank you, really appreciate that.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Donald Trump, back with John Kasich after this short break…	0
"This Sunday, what ever happened to the ""Stop Trump"" movement?"	0
advertisement	0
We're winning by a lot.	0
We're kicking ass, I'll tell you.	0
Trump keeps winning.	0
G.O.P.	0
leaders are falling in line, and neither Cruz nor Kasich are gaining momentum.	0
"Is it possible this ""Stop Trump"" movement has been stopped?"	0
Plus, my sit-down with Bernie Sanders.	0
I will do everything that I can to make certain that-- Donald Trump is not elected president.	0
The senator from Vermont on Trump, his chances of winning the nomination, and why he thinks he's losing to Hillary Clinton.	0
Well because poor people don’t vote.	0
I mean, that’s just a fact that’s a sad reality of American society.	0
advertisement	0
Also, is the U.S. helping to cover up a Saudi Arabian government role in 9/11?	0
There are 28 pages that may have the answers.	0
Should they be declassified?	0
And joining me for insight and analysis this Sunday morning are Robert Costa of The Washington Post, MSNBC's Joy-Ann Reid, Republican strategist Nicolle Wallace, and Jose Diaz-Balart, of NBC News and Telemundo.	0
Welcome to Sunday.	0
It's Meet the Press.	0
From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.	0
Good Sunday morning, with Bernie Sanders’ prospects for taking the Democratic nomination from Hillary Clinton getting slimmer by the day.	0
Sanders told me yesterday that he's fallen behind because in his words, poor people don't vote.	0
There's a lot more in that interview, and we're going to get to it later in the show.	0
And we're going to get to the Democrats as well.	0
But we begin with the Republican race.	0
It is no stretch to conclude that when it comes to Donald Trump, the Republican party has slowly been working its way through the classic five stages of grief.	0
"The first one was denial, ""Trump can't be taken seriously,"" the second one, anger, ""What makes this guy think he is even a Republican or a conservative anyway?"""	0
"The third, bargaining, ""Let's take it to the voters, they'll reject him, right?"""	0
"The fourth, depression, ""Oh my God, he's actually winning this thing."""	0
And now the fifth stage, the hardest one of all, acceptance.	0
Why?	0
Trump just won big in New York.	0
He's expected to win big in the five primaries that are held this Tuesday, which include Pennsylvania, where our new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll has Trump with a double-digit lead, sitting at 45 percent, over Ted Cruz at 27, John Kasich at 24.	0
And yes, if you add up Kasich and Cruz, it's a majority.	0
"Which of course, is going to make the ""Stop Trump"" people hit their head against the wall."	0
For the anti-Trump loyalists who are counting on Indiana nine days later to be their firewall, consider this: the only poll we've seen out of Indiana in the last week came out Friday.	0
And it shows Trump leading by just six points.	0
But the fact that he's ahead is a big deal, 37-31, Kasich sitting at 22, again, Cruz and Kasich, together, over 50.	0
Throw in a Republican establishment though that seems more cowed now by Trump than energized to defeat him, and the G.O.P.	0
"does look more and more as if it's ready to accept the man whose name often appears after the word, ""Never."""	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
advertisement	0
And presidential's easy.	0
"With ""Stop Trump"" going nowhere, this week, three signs that Republicans are now tiptoeing towards acceptance, coming to terms with the fact that Donald Trump may be the party's nominee."	0
Sign number one, evidence of surrender by the party's leaders.	0
At the R.N.C.	0
"spring meeting in Florida, Republican chairman Reince Priebus warned ""Stop Trump"" sympathizers to get in line."	0
Politics is a team sport.	0
And we can't win unless we rally around whoever becomes our nominee.	0
And the party went out of its way to disprove Trump's charge that it's rigging the game.	0
It rejected changes to convention rules.	0
After Mitch McConnell seemed to relish the idea of Trump losing a multiple-ballot convention--	0
I'm increasingly optimistic that there actually may be a second ballot.	0
advertisement	0
--he quickly walked that back.	0
What I said somewhat inartfully is that we'll have a nominee once we get to 1,237.	0
With Republicans, including former nominee John McCain, threatening skip to convention, House Speaker Paul Ryan urged his party to be there.	0
I think it could be a great, historical exercise.	0
I mean, it could be something that you'll remember for the rest of your lives.	0
"Sign number two, the ""Stop Trump"" movement isn't spending."	0
Not a dime on TV ads in New York.	0
Just $300,000 in this Tuesday's primaries, which Trump is expected to dominate.	0
Instead, holding its fire until the May 3rd Indiana primary.	0
To stop Trump, vote for Cruz.	0
Sign number three, the failure of an anti-Trump alternative to launch.	0
John Kasich is an honorable and decent man, whose only role in this election is as a spoiler.	0
If he was saying that if I couldn't mathematically win the nomination, I should get out, he can't mathematically win it.	0
To make acceptance easier to swallow, Trump's team is softening his image, promising a more disciplined, professional candidate who can work with the party.	0
We’re here really to let them know that we're going to run a traditional campaign with them.	0
And behind closed doors, Trump's new campaign chief went further.	0
And when he's out on the stage, when he's talking about the kinds of things he's talking about on the stump, he's projecting an image that's for that purpose.	0
You'll start to see more depth of the person, the real person.	0
But on Saturday, the new Trump sounded a lot like the old Trump.	0
Lyin’ Ted Cruz, right?	0
"He said, ""He is saying,"" you know, with that horrible flourish, you know the hands?"	0
He walks in, bible held high, then he puts the bible down, and then he lies.	0
He's a liar.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Oh, good old Trump.	0
I'm joined by Katie Packer.	0
"She's been a key figure in this ""Never Trump"" movement."	0
She runs an anti-Trump PAC called Our Principles PAC.	0
And Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.	0
I want to bring in the panel in a few moments here.	0
But Kate, let me start with you.	0
"You're the most-prominent face these days from ""Never Trump."""	0
Why are you the most-prominent face?	0
I say that with all due respect.	0
You're not an elected official, you're not running for president, you've worked for people that have run for president.	0
"Why are Republican officials afraid of being the face of a ""Never Trump"" movement?"	0
I'm not sure.	0
I'm not sure I can answer that question.	0
I think that a lot of them frankly are sort of hoping upon hope that this goes another direction and that they don't alienate the supporters of Trump in the process.	0
But certainly, there are a lot of people behind closed doors that are expressing real concern.	0
Because they tell you one thing.	0
"And then you say, ""Great, tell the people."""	0
Sure--	0
"And they’re like ""Well, geez, I've got scheduling commitments."""	0
Well, these are smart people.	0
And they understand that with Trump at the top of the ticket, we not only lose the White House, we definitely lose the Senate, we very likely lose the House, and we probably lose elections for a generation because we have somebody that’s known to be a sexist, very likely a racist at the top of our ticket, and it's very damaging to the party.	0
Michael Steele, you and I have had conversations.	0
You seem to be in a different place here, that yeah, you're not enthusiastic about him, but you're accepting the idea that he's going to be the nominee.	0
Yeah, look, this has been a process that has unfolded, starting, going back to June of last year.	0
And all that time, there have been a myriad of efforts and opportunities to stop Trump.	0
But they haven't worked.	0
Why?	0
And the one thing about these movements and the folks that we're talking about seem to don't understand or be able to answer the question, why do people continue to vote for him?	0
What is it about what he's saying and doing that still attracts the core base of the G.O.P.	0
?	0
Yes, it's 35 percent, 45 percent, whatever, it's less than 50 percent.	0
But when when you look at the totality of the movement and the effort that he's put out there, there is a response to it.	0
So why aren't they responding to Kasich?	0
Why aren't they responding to Cruz?	0
Why aren't they winning and Trump is?	0
And that's the core question that nobody in Washington seems to want to wrap their head around.	0
Which is why Donald Trump is in the space he's in.	0
"Katie, I guess you seem to be running, The Hill I think captured it really well, they had a headline that said, ""Never Trump,"" in quotes, referring to your group, essentially, your goals are colliding with the goals of Kasich and Cruz."	0
And we saw it here, you know?	0
Cruz has the best shot in Indiana, so you're hoping Kasich doesn't campaign there.	0
Kasich has the best shot at Maryland, you're hoping Cruz doesn't campaign there.	0
But the two campaigns aren't listening.	0
Well, and that's a frustration for sure.	0
What we've seen historically though is by this point in time, the election does come down to two candidates.	0
It was Romney and Santorum, it was McCain and Romney.	0
And at that point in time, somebody begins to coalesce support.	0
Somebody begins to win a majority.	0
Trump is nowhere near that.	0
If you look at McCain and Romney's numbers as they progressed through the primaries, they were ramping up.	0
Trump is in a total flat-line.	0
That’s fair, but Cruz and Kasich have not been able to galvanize either side.	0
Absolutely, absolutely.	0
And it's a total frustration.	0
But, our message is, let's take it to the convention.	0
Let's let this process play itself out.	0
If you don't like Ted Cruz and you don't want to vote for him, that's okay.	0
You're not going to give this to him by voting for him.	0
He's not going to get to 1,237 before the convention.	0
But let's do what we can to get this to an open convention, and then duke it out.	0
Michael Steele, and I want to bring in the panel after this.	0
"But it was Chairman Priebus this week that I felt like started to wave the white flag when he said, ""We're not going to make any rules changes."""	0
If the party wanted to stop Trump, why not make a rules change?	0
Yeah, that's effectively how you would do it.	0
I mean, look, we saw them do it to Ron Paul in 2012.	0
If they want to stop somebody, they can.	0
If they can stop someone, they can stop him.	0
They chose not to?	0
But it goes back to what Katie was saying.	0
They recognize that what Donald Trump has done is galvanized a whole new level of voter out there.	0
Folks who've sat on their behinds for the last six, eight years, not participated, now coming out.	0
But the other thing to keep in mind is just because Cruz and Kasich are at 51 percent together, don't assume that those voters, Trump isn't their second choice either.	0
So don't assume that that 51 percent is going to be there should one of them drop out.	0
Let me bring in the panel, and they can start to bother you with some questions.	0
Nicolle Wallace, of course, Republican strategist and NBC News analyst, former President Bush/John McCain strategist.	0
Jose Diaz-Balart, a colleague of mine both at NBC News and Telemundo, Robert Costa of The Washington Post, and Joy-Ann Reid, also a colleague of mine at MSNBC.	0
Nicolle, you've been in acceptance mode of Trump for quite some time.	0
Yes, thanks to you and your colleagues I have had to live out all five stages in weepy real time.	0
I think that one of the-- I'm very sympathetic to what you're trying to do.	0
I think that one of the challenges is that the solution to the problem that you rightfully diagnose isn't any more appealing than the problem itself.	0
Republicans aren’t any more enthusiastic or more optimistic about the outcome of Cruz at the top of the ticket.	0
So what do you say to them?	0
Well, I would say just what I said to Chuck.	0
That the goal here is to drive this to an open convention and--	0
And skip Trump and skip Cruz and get to door number three?	0
Potentially.	0
Potentially.	0
If you're not happy with any of the choices, the last time we had a convention like this was 1976.	0
But it was very different, because everybody was virtually in one camp or the other.	0
There are a lot of people that are in none of these camps.	0
"And to those voters, we’d say, ""If that's the camp you're in, you're not happy with your choices, then vote for Cruz, vote for Kasich, because that'll get what's behind door number two."""	0
And we don't know what that is, but it's better than the option we have in front of us.	0
But isn't the main problem here though that any of the solutions that you would come up with that's not Donald Trump, is going to take that, let’s say it's 30 to 40 percent of the Republican base that are white, blue-collar voters, white working-class voters who are clearly enraged, primarily at the Republican party.	0
Any outcome but Trump may alienate those voters in such a way that it dooms the party in November no matter what.	0
I think the problem is, is that the party is the problem.	0
It's the 40-some odd years of promises that were not fulfilled even by the tea party, because eventually they even went Washington to a lot of these voters.	0
So I think that these voters are so angry that you almost have to give them Donald Trump in order to satiate that anger.	0
Well, I think that's naïve though to suggest that you're not going to have 35 to 40 percent of the party that stays home if it's Trump.	0
"I mean, we've got real data to demonstrate that, that there's real frustration, and people saying, ""I'm not going to vote for Trump in the general election, even though I'm a Republican."""	0
Let's remember that this process started with about 200,000 Republicans running for president.	0
There were more people running for president than you see at a quinces party in Little Havana.	0
And yet, the voters during that process, whittled it down to three, and really, down to one.	0
So this concept that now somebody else is going to come up, there were 17.	0
There was African-Americans, there was two Latinos, there were, you know, women.	0
And yet, it's all down to Trump.	0
Let's not forget that.	0
And the scene at the RNC, it told us so much.	0
I was standing outside of the meeting room when Paul Manafort stepped out.	0
And I was looking at my notebook, what I had recorded that day, and it was all RNC members giving out their business card to the Trump campaign.	0
In Hollywood, Florida, white sand beaches, everyone's relaxed.	0
Hey, Mr. Manafort, don't forget my name.	0
Really?	0
Oh my word.	0
And I sat up in Priebus’ suite.	0
And what is the first thing he told The Washington Post was he had a great phone call with Donald Trump this past week congratulated him on New York.	0
All right, let me throw something out here in a bit.	0
Do we believe there has been a new Trump?	0
I'm going to play for you.	0
Cruz doesn't believe it, and then you'll hear Trump's response to it.	0
Here it is.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
They were saying, these are their words, that all of this was just a show.	0
That he doesn't believe anything he's saying.	0
He's just trying to fool gullible voters, and he's not going to do any of it.	0
He's not going to build a wall, he's not going to deport anyone.	0
He is telling us he is lying to us.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Well, Trump, of course, the new Trump, was the old Trump.	0
Take a listen.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
"So Cruz picks it up, Lying Ted, he goes, ""Donald Trump is kidding everybody."	0
"He's different on the trail."""	0
"He said, ""And he said that he's going to do things differently and he's not going to build the wall."""	0
What the hell does this have to do with the wall?	0
Believe me.	0
I'm building the wall.	0
(END TAPE)	0
All right, Michael and Katie, I want to hear from the two of you first.	0
Michael, is this a new Trump?	0
I mean, Paul Manafort promised a more-- Trump with more depth.	0
That didn't stop, that sounded like the old Trump.	0
Well, it's new wine and an old wine skin.	0
I mean, basically, the outward side of Trump is still going to be Trump.	0
He's still going to go riff on the party and riff on the politics of the party.	0
But when he needs to be in that zone, where he wants to specifically communicate, I think you will see it.	0
And I think we've already seen him at times try to do that.	0
Where he uses the notes and he--	0
But he mocked it.	0
Okay, Katie, well, look--	0
MICHAEL STEELE	0
He mocks it but that’s what people like Chuck, they like that.	0
Listen to what he said about being presidential.	0
Watch this.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Presidential's easy.	0
You know what presidential is?	0
I walk on.	0
So you walk on.	0
Ladies and gentlemen, of Waterbury.	0
It is a great honor to be with you this morning.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Katie, he mocks the process.	0
And he actually mocked his own guy, Manafort.	0
Well, it would be funny if it weren't so frightening.	0
I mean, this is a guy that's running to be the leader of the free world.	0
He's not running to play a part on a reality TV show.	0
And I do think he's mocking the process.	0
And the notion that you're going to take a guy that's 70 years old, and he's going to adopt a whole new personality, he doesn't even know that what he's doing is offensive.	0
So the idea that he's going to somehow change it along the way is impossible.	0
You can’t beat something with nothing.	0
You cannot beat something with nothing.	0
And at the end of the day, you can say that, you know, that these voters are diluted, that they're being taken in by show biz, but you cannot beat that with nothing.	0
"And the problem with the ""Stop Trump"" movement is that you're offering nothing."	0
"You're saying, ""Just don't give us this guy because there's something wrong with him."""	0
Well, obviously the voters who are preferring him are saying he's offering an Occam's-razor solution to their existential crisis of economic want, of feeling that they've been left behind by the party.	0
He's offering them something.	0
And your side is offering them nothing.	0
Most Republican strategists though, they worry.	0
As much as Trump changes his temperament, in a general election, he still has to carry the burden of the Muslim ban, he still has to carry the burden of his policies on the wall.	0
Those are not temperamental changes.	0
And the real conversations, you both know this, that are taking place are how we lose.	0
Do we lose with Cruz?	0
I mean the reality we can try to-- We can try to spin it into something else.	0
It's do we lose with Cruz, who we know will not appeal to the people who determine the outcome of elections, largely women, largely independents and swing voters, or do we roll the dice on Trump?	0
Trump's strength is pulling the curtain down on the process.	0
The process is a lot of poof.	0
All right.	0
Final question and word to the two of you, Michael I'll go with you, and Katie get the last word.	0
John Kasich is the only candidate we can find that beats Hillary Clinton in our Pennsylvania poll.	0
Doesn’t lose--	0
That's it.	0
Hillary Clinton has double digits over both Cruz and Trump.	0
"Why isn't this ""Stop Trump"" movement uniting behind the one guy that has the electability argument in his favor?"	0
First Michael, then Katie.	0
"I have to admit, that is the one thing that has made no sense to me at all, because the guy standing in front of you, which every poll shows can defeat, and that I've heard from Democrats who say, ""Look, if you'd nominate Kasich, this becomes a different race for me in November."""	0
"And yet, the ""Stop Trump"" folks want to focus on people who cannot win a general election against Hillary Clinton."	0
It is befuddling.	0
Which is why again, the voters look at what they're doing and go--	0
All right, so Katie, last word.	0
"Why aren't you guys the pro-Kasich movement, not the ""Stop Trump"" movement?"	0
"The ""Stop Trump"" movement is about keeping Donald Trump's head down and keeping the pressure on him and hopefully one of these candidates will do what they need to do to draw voters to them."	0
But the reality is, that in a state like Indiana, Kasich isn't going to beat Trump.	0
So we have to put our support behind Cruz and hope that those voters come together behind Cruz.	0
You know, it's not a choice that we'd like to be making.	0
I don't know why our voters ignored the 15 candidates that might have been able to beat Hillary Clinton and narrowed it down to a couple that probably can't.	0
But that's where we are.	0
Four years from now, we will have the quinces caucus first.	0
I think that is the one thing we’ve determined there.	0
Anyway, Katie Packer, Michael Steele, thanks very much.	0
I think Katie, you got bombarded here left and right on your movement.	0
But you took it well.	0
Thank you for joining us.	0
Thank you.	0
When we come back, my sit-down with a conciliatory of sorts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont.	0
Take a listen.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Look at the polls.	0
Bernie Sanders runs better against Trump in almost all of these polls than does Hillary Clinton.	0
(END TAPE)	0
If you listen carefully to this interview, you might hear Sanders accept that he's not likely to be the Democratic nominee.	0
Coming up.	0
Welcome back.	0
Bernie Sanders is spending the weekend campaigning in Maryland ahead of Tuesday's primary.	0
It's been a tough week for Sanders.	0
His chances of beating Hillary Clinton received a near fatal blow after he was convincingly beaten in the New York primary.	0
Sanders has vowed to fight on.	0
But he needs to win the remaining contest by some big margins to have any chance of catching Clinton at the Philadelphia convention.	0
I sat down with him in Baltimore yesterday, and I started by asking him about his differences that still remain with Hillary Clinton.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Hillary Clinton the other night in her victory speech after New York said this:	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
And to all the people who supported Senator Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Do you agree with her on that?	0
I think there is a lot that unites us.	0
I think there's a lot that divides us.	0
I think the fact that all of us are in agreement that Donald Trump would be a disaster for this country if he became president unites us, the fact that we understand, for example, that climate change is real while our Republican opponents ignore that reality unites us.	0
But on the other hand, I think what divides us is the understanding on the part of millions of people who are supporting my candidacy that it really is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.	0
We have to deal in a very substantive way with income and wealth inequality.	0
We need to understand why we're the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people, not to have paid family and medical leave.	0
And that we have to deal aggressively with a corrupt campaign finance system which allows big money interest to buy elections.	0
Those are areas I think of difference.	0
Well, it's interesting you say they're differences.	0
"If she were here she'd say, ""I agree with you on campaign finance."	0
"I agree with you on Medicare, I agree with you on--"""	0
No, no.	0
You're-- no, but that's not--	0
She would say she would agree with those goals.	0
Well, but we all agree with goals.	0
I mean, I suppose everybody has general understanding, you know, that we don't want to see a nuclear war and so forth.	0
But I think that I believe in a Medicare for all, single-payer program that guarantees health care to all people.	0
I have not only shown by talk, but by walking the walk that you can run a campaign -- a strong, winning, national campaign -- getting millions of individuals to make small campaign contributions.	0
That has not been Secretary Clinton's approach.	0
We have not been dependent on big money interest.	0
And that is perhaps the most important thing.	0
Because I'm not quite sure that you're ever going to change this country, you're ever going to take on the billionaire class, ever going to create a government that works for the middle class, so long as you're dependent on Wall Street money and big money interest.	0
You wake up the day after the convention and you're not the nominee.	0
"Do you look in the mirror and say, ""This was a successful campaign?"""	0
Well, obviously our goal now is while we have a narrow path to victory, we're going to fight for and through that path.	0
We hope to win.	0
But I think the fact that we have shown that there is massive dissatisfaction in this country with the status quo, that people want to think bigger, that people understand that when you have 20 people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom 150 million people, that people are showing in this campaign-- the desire to stand up and fight back.	0
The fact that we have brought millions of young people who I think many of the pundits had thought were kind of apathetic, not interested in politics.	0
Well, you know what?	0
These young people know they're the future of this country.	0
They want to shape the future.	0
And I'm very proud that we have been able to bring them into the political process.	0
You just described it as a narrow path.	0
Yes.	0
So what is it?	0
Explain it to me?	0
Well, we're going to have to do-- obviously win big in the number of the primaries and caucuses that yet remain.	0
A poll came out yesterday that has us within striking distance in California, a larger state.	0
I think we can do very well in California.	0
But it starts with winning some states here, winning a Pennsylvania, winning Connecticut--	0
It means-- well, bottom line, the arithmetic is you got to win delegates, that's what it means.	0
We have won twelve--	0
And in this case, it means big primary wins?	0
Right.	0
We have won 1,200 delegates.	0
And by the way, when we talk about the campaign, you know, we started this campaign 60, 65 points behind Secretary Clinton in national polls.	0
Now many of these polls have us even, a few points ahead perhaps.	0
Many of the polls now show us-- and this is an important point, Chuck -- when Democrats look out into the horizon, what unites us is the understanding that Trump would be a disastrous president.	0
Look at the polls.	0
Bernie Sanders runs better against Trump in almost all of these polls than does Hillary Clinton.	0
But she runs well, too?	0
She runs well, too.	0
But, well, in some --	0
I mean, so does that hurt your cause a little bit?	0
It's like, yeah, you do better.	0
But she runs pretty well, too.	0
Well, I think the answer is depending on the polls.	0
And polls are polls.	0
I don't want to go crazy on polls.	0
But I think many Democrats are convinced that what is most important is defeating Donald Trump.	0
And I believe the objective evidence is that I'm the stronger candidate.	0
So, I was just going to say, at the end of the day, you feel like you were given a fair shot at this nomination?	0
Yeah, we took advantage of the opportunities in front of us.	0
We are in this race.	0
We are not writing our obituary.	0
We're in this race to California, and we're proud of the campaign we ran.	0
We crunched some interesting numbers here.	0
So 17 of the 25 states with the highest levels of income inequality have held primaries.	0
Sixteen of those 17 states have been won by Hillary Clinton, not by you.	0
Why?	0
Well, because poor people don't vote.	1
I mean, that's just a fact.	0
That's a sad reality of American society.	0
And that's what we have to transform.	0
We have one-- as you know, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on Earth.	0
We have done a good job bringing young people in.	0
I think we have done-- had some success with lower income people.	0
But in America today -- the last election in 2014, 80 percent of poor people did not vote.	0
You feel as if you could find a way to get people that are fighting at that poverty line-- you know, either just below it or just above it, if they were getting engaged in the process, you would do better?	0
If we can significantly increase voter turnout so that low income people and working people and young people participated in the political process, if we got a voter turnout of 75 percent, this country would be radically transformed.	0
President Obama's getting a little bit of criticism in the U.K. for speaking out against-- he doesn't want to see British citizens vote to take the U.K. out of the E.U.	0
First of all, where are you on that?	0
And second of all, would you insert yourself into this campaign?	0
Well, let the British people make their own decisions on that.	0
So you don't think the president should be commenting on this?	0
The President has every right to comment on what he wants.	0
Though I'm a candidate for president right now, I'm not going to.	0
So as president you would not have a--?	0
I didn't say that, no.	0
He is the president.	0
I am a candidate for president.	0
Right, do you have a view on this?	0
Not a significant one, no.	0
Let the people-- I think the European Union obviously is a very, very important institution.	0
But ultimately, the people of Britain are going to make their own decisions.	0
I would hope that they stay in, but that's their decision.	0
Why are you against the consumption tax-- the soda tax in Philadelphia--	0
I'll tell you why.	0
--that would pay for Pre-K?	0
Universal Pre-K. Hillary Clinton's for it.	0
Yes.	0
I'll tell you why.	0
Because it is a totally regressive tax and right now, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, when the wealthy are getting wealthier-- many of them pay an effective tax rate lower than working people.	0
You have large multinational corporations not paying a nickel in federal taxes.	0
That's where you get the money.	0
Somebody's making $20,000 a year and they buy a bottle of soda, I don't think you charge them $0.30 more for that bottle of soda.	0
Now, the goal of universal childcare--	0
Pre-K, yeah--	0
--absolutely something that I strongly agree.	0
And I applaud the mayor there for coming forward.	0
But raise the money in a way that is progressive, not on the backs of low income or working people.	0
So you must be against cigarette taxes, too, then?	0
No, I'm not.	0
Cigarette taxes are-- there's a difference between cigarettes and soda.	0
I am aware of the obesity problem in this country.	0
I don't think Michael Bloomberg would agree with you on that one?	0
Well, that's fine.	0
He can have his point of view.	0
But cigarettes are causing cancer, obviously, and a dozen other diseases.	0
And there is almost the question as to why it remains a legal product in this country.	0
Let me wrap up the question this way.	0
Do you feel as if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and you're not, but Donald Trump is the opponent, do you have a responsibility to do what it takes to get your voters to support Hillary Clinton?	0
I will do everything that I can to make certain that Donald Trump is not elected president.	0
But if that scenario plays out, the major responsibility will be on Secretary Clinton to convince all people, not just my supporters, that she is the kind of president this country needs to represent working people in this country, to take on the big money interests who have so much power, to fight for what the American people want.	0
Your supporters are, for the most part, very skeptical of Hillary Clinton.	0
Very, very skeptical.	0
Tougher on her, frankly, than you ever are.	0
You know, people talk about all this back and forth.	0
What do you think she-- what's your advice to her on winning your voters over?	0
Well, I think she's going to have to be very explicit about supporting a program, which stands up for the needs of the middle class and working families, which, most importantly, makes it clear that she is prepared to take on Wall Street in a very clear way, take on the billionaire class, come up with a program that makes health care for all in this country a right within the next several years.	0
I think those are some of the issues she's going to have to bring forth.	0
(END TAPE)	0
So did we just hear, intentionally or not, the Bernie Sanders exit interview?	0
We'll get to that later in the show.	0
Also, why did Donald Trump's magic number to win the nomination, why is it that it might be lower than 1,237?	0
I’ll explain.	0
And we are back.	0
Data download time.	0
We've been hearing a lot about the so-called magic number of delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination.	0
It's 1,237.	0
It's pretty much tattooed on the foreheads of everybody in the NBC News political unit.	0
But Trump's magic number could be less.	0
In fact, it could be a lot less, because he's likely to pick up these so-called unbound delegates.	0
These are the people that can do whatever they want on the first ballot.	0
They can vote for whoever, regardless of how their state voted.	0
So how does it all happen?	0
Here's our back-of-the-napkin math.	0
We're going to start with this magic number of 1,237, and then subtract from that the number of unbound delegates that we're estimating Trump's likely to pick up.	0
So we're going to start with nine unbound delegates from the collection of Colorado, Wyoming, and Guam contests.	0
They haven't been awarded to a single candidate yet.	0
So in our breakdown, we're going to assume that Trump can negotiate his way to three of those folks.	0
Now, there are the Rubio delegates.	0
NBC has reported that 34 of the delegates Marco Rubio earned during the primary season will be unbound on that first ballot, negotiating his way to some Rubio supporters, we think Trump can pick up seven of those folks.	0
Not a lot, but a handful.	0
Well, now we go to the 54 Pennsylvania delegates who won't be bound to any candidate after Tuesday's primary.	0
About 60 percent of those running for delegates have indicated publicly that they will either support Trump or whoever wins their congressional district.	0
Which if you believe our polls is likely to be Trump.	0
So we're going to put 34 out of those 54 delegates in Trump's column for now.	0
So all told, that's 44 unbound delegates Trump could pick up, a conservative estimate mind you.	0
So subtract that from 1,237, and we get a new magic number: 1,193.	0
So that's probably the maximum that he needs here.	0
That's the real number Trump will need before he starts picking up what we think are those unbound delegates.	0
Now again, we think this is a conservative estimates.	0
It's possible Trump can win more of these votes.	0
Because Trump's expected to sweep all five states on Tuesday.	0
And then momentum could take over.	0
He could pick up more of those folks and then his magic number could drop from 1,193 down to 1,150 after the last primary.	0
"And in fact, it may be very hard for the ""Stop Trump"" movement to keep Trump below 1,150."	0
Either way, while Trump technically still needs 1,237 in that first ballot, it's clear he does not need that many pledged delegates by the end of voting in June.	0
"And that's what makes the ""Stop Trump"" forces even more nervous."	0
Up next, Donald Trump's campaign says he's just been playing the part of a candidate.	0
That we'll soon see a new Trump.	0
Well, if that's true, how do you explain this moment yesterday?	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
He can't win with the popular vote, because he's got zero personality, because he lies like a thief, okay?	0
(END TAPE)	0
Welcome back.	0
The panel is back.	0
Let's start quickly with some reaction to Bernie Sanders.	0
Joy?	0
Poor people don't vote?	0
Yeah.	0
An interesting new excuse from Bernie Sanders.	0
"And then some Hillary supporters have pointed it out, ""Oh, first it was the South, now it's poor people."""	0
Yeah.	0
And it really got a huge reaction, just when the preview of the sound came out in just my social media world.	0
And I think part of the problem is the word you use, the excuses.	0
"That you're saying you're running a political revolution, but you keep parsing, ""Well, we don't have just the right kind of voter motivated enough or informed enough."	0
"You know, they're too old-fashioned, or they're too conservative."""	0
And in this case, sort of putting it off on poverty, I don't think he meant to disparage, clearly, people, and impugn people who are poor.	0
But the idea is if you are truly running a revolutionary movement, based on lifting up people at the bottom, then they should be hearing your message or you might not be doing something correctly.	0
You know, look, I think at another time and in another conversation, this would have been an important conversation to have.	0
I think it's a fact of life that in the United States, the amount of people who were citizens in the United States, who aren't registered to vote, and could vote, are huge.	0
And this country would look differently if from our elected official if everybody voted.	0
I mean look, at Telemundo, we have a campaign, yo resido , it's bringing in people to register to vote.	0
It would be a different country if everyone was registered to vote.	0
It's just that conversation at the time you had it.	0
But the only people who give excuses for why they're losing are the people who should probably be out.	0
And I can't understand why there isn't more pressure on him to get out.	0
When she was--	0
You're surprised?	0
When she was in his position in 2008, there was a crushing cacophony of voices from the media, and the dem--	0
She didn’t, though.	0
Well, she did.	0
And she was still winning.	0
She didn’t.	0
She went to the end.	0
I can't imagine what reason there is, other than chaos--	0
Forty million plus a month?	0
Other than the chaos on the Republican side for him staying in and doing her damage.	0
He's not making--	0
Nicolle, he's getting millions and millions of dollars in small contributions.	0
NICOLLE WALLACE	0
To what end?	0
He can't be the nominee, and he can't win.	0
People believe in him.	0
But to call her unqualified, to question her ethics is something that if the Republicans were in a stronger position, this is where the despair on the Republican side comes--	0
But you know what, the reason for him to continue though is that you still have, you have a small number of states left.	0
But we've come this far in the process.	0
And I think the voters--	0
There's nowhere to go, Joy!	0
What about California?	0
California.	0
Democratic voters have made it very clear that they all want to weigh in.	0
I think, you know what?	0
Let's give people a chance--	0
That’s fine.	0
It's called democracy.	0
It's called democracy.	0
He's not going to be the nominee.	0
Go ahead, Bob.	0
If you listen to the end of the interview, he's quite positive about the future of the party.	0
He's oddly conciliatory at the end.	0
Yes.	0
He's conciliatory.	0
And he said--	0
Because he knows he’s going to lose.	0
"But he's also willing to offer the branch to Secretary Clinton and say, ""If she wins the nomination, Trump is the main target for Democrats, and the party will come together."""	0
And I was just struck by that moment at the end, in spite of all the animus we've seen, that's his closing statement.	0
By the way, I want to go, let's turn back to the Republicans here.	0
I want to play, it was interesting to see, is Trump pivoting to a general election, and it had to do with comments he made about Caitlyn Jenner and bathrooms.	0
First of all, let me play that excerpt from The Today Show town hall earlier in the week.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
You leave it the way it is.	0
There have been very few complaints the way it is.	0
People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.	0
There has been so little trouble.	0
So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses?	0
That is correct.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Well, the Cruz campaign has unloaded on those comments.	0
Nicolle, let me show it to you.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Guess who's joined the ranks of the P.C.	0
police?	0
People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.	0
Donald Trump can't be trusted with common sense.	0
Why would we trust him in the White House?	0
(END TAPE)	0
Nicolle, we haven't seen an attack ad from Cruz on Trump in a long time.	0
It feels like it's been a while.	0
And that's what he chose to do.	0
Effective or no?	0
Well, here's where Trump is an insult wrapped in a riddle wrapped in an opportunity.	0
I mean, Trump's answer made so much sense, and I think what is also on the line in this cycle is the power and the saliency of social issues.	0
And I think if Trump wins, it delivers a massive blow to the idea that you have to be up and down on social issues to be the Republican nominee.	0
I was just surprised by Cruz's decision to do that.	0
Robert?	0
To be able to win these coming states, Cruz needs to rouse the social conservatives.	0
I think Trump's answer tells us a lot about how he would be in a general election.	0
This is someone who has not climbed the ladder, forming relationships with social conservatives along the way.	0
He's someone forged in New York's tabloid business culture, he has relationships with all kinds of people, he's not just someone who surrounds himself with Republicans and conservatives.	0
And that actually strangely worries Democrats, that he wouldn't be appealing to moderates.	0
Joy-Ann, I'm going to have you chime in, but I want to play what Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton has a web video out, also using The Today Show moment to make a different point from Ted Cruz.	0
Watch.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
I will be changing very rapidly.	0
I'm very capable of changing to anything I want to change to.	0
(END TAPE)	0
And then they go on to play it, and it's a very long thing, they want to call it an Etch-A-Sketch, in a reference to Mitt Romney--	0
I think it--	0
--and Santorum back in the day.	0
Well, because Donald Trump is clearly, he has exposed the fact that a lot of the base of the Republican party are not movement conservatives who have spent their entire lives pouring over the doctrinaire minutia of conservative beliefs.	0
And what he said was common sense.	0
I think that is the big risk of Trump.	0
He could be anything in the general election.	0
He could pivot back on social issues to a place where he's not offending Democratic voters.	0
Well, this is the thing--	0
But women--	0
But that’s on that, but he'll offend African Americans, women, Muslims, and everyone else, some issues--	0
Don’t forget, most of the immigrants across the border are rapists and murderers.	0
But, I think what's fascinating is that--	0
That would come back.	0
And that would come back.	0
The bathroom issue brought Cruz and Clinton together.	0
Sort of.	0
But I think Trump's answer-- Trump’s answer got him a lot of credit with a lot of people.	0
It did.	0
All right, I've got to take a quick break.	0
When we come back, U.S. insists there's no evidence that any high-level Saudi Arabian government officials played a role in plotting 9/11.	0
So why does the American government refuse to release 28 pages of a congressional report that could tell a different story?	0
President Obama's been on the world stage this week, meeting the Queen of England, and a future king, Prince George even stayed up past his bedtime to meet the President.	0
But he got a somewhat chilly reception early in the week in Saudi Arabia, where he was greeted on the tarmac by a relatively minor member of the royal family.	0
Just the governor of Riyadh, roughly the equivalent of the United States sending a local governor to greet a major foreign leader when they land on U.S. soil.	0
U.S./Saudi relations are strained, to put it mildly, at the moment.	0
With renewed calls in Washington to declassify 28 pages of a congressional report on 9/11 that some believe allege some direct links to the Arab kingdom when it comes to the 9/11 attacks.	0
It's a link the Saudis have strenuously denied for years.	0
Well, I'm joined by one of the chief proponents of declassifying those 28 pages, former Senator Bob Graham of Florida.	0
He served as co-chair of that congressional inquiry, was chairman of the intelligence committee for that period of time, a familiar face at that period of time.	0
Senator Graham, welcome back to Meet the Press.	0
Thank you, Chuck.	0
All right.	0
Let's go right to the specifics of these 28 pages.	0
What is in them that the American-- high levels of American officials and Saudi officials fear will change things if they become public?	0
Chuck, to me, the most important unanswered question of 9/11 is did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported?	0
I think it's implausible to think that people who couldn't speak English, had never been in the United States before, as a group were not well-educated could have done that.	0
So who was the most likely entity to have provided them that support?	0
And I think all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia.	0
We know that Saudi Arabia started Al Qaeda.	0
It was a creation of Saudi-- of Saudi Arabia..	0
And when you say Saudi Arabia, are you saying the government?	0
Or are you saying wealthy individuals who happen to be Saudi Arabian?	0
That is a very murky line.	0
Saudi Arabia has made it murky by its own legal action.	0
Whenever a U.S. group sues a Saudi Arabian entity, whether it’s a bank, a foundation, a charity, immediately, the defense of sovereign immunity is raised.	0
The Saudis don't recognize the difference between a royal decision and a societal decision in the same way that other countries might.	0
So I think it covers a broad range, from the highest ranks of the kingdom through these, what would be private entities.	0
Okay.	0
If this gets released publicly, and again, I know you don't want to say what's in it, you don't want to-- but let me ask you this.	0
"One description that has been made of these 28 pages is that it's basically an initial police report that if you looked at it, you would say, ""Wow, we should investigate that, that, that and that more."""	0
Is that the best way to describe this?	0
No.	0
This report was 850 pages.	0
This is 28 pages out of that.	0
There's been no questions raised about the professionalism and quality of the other 820 pages of this report.	0
And this chapter followed the same standards that they did.	0
Instead of debating what might be there, why don't we let the American people read the 28 pages, and the other thousands of documents that have been withheld that relate to the Saudi involvement in 9/11.	0
And then make up their own mind.	0
What keeps this from-- why do I feel like candidate Barack Obama or Senator Barack Obama might be in a different place?	0
What is it within the minute somebody gets into the executive branch, Republican or Democrat, there is this consensus publicly to protect Saudi Arabia?	0
I think it goes back to the fact that 60 years ago, Franklin Roosevelt and the King of Saudi Arabia entered into a special relationship.	0
We provided them with security, they provided us with petroleum.	0
And that has affected the culture and the attitude around this relationship.	0
But I think it's fundamentally changed, it's changing almost on a daily basis, as we are less dependent on the Saudis for petroleum, as some of the things that the Saudis are doing are so dramatically adverse to our interests, such as training the next generation of the young terrorists in their mosque in schools -- their madrasas.	0
The schism between the United States and Saudi Arabia is now very apparent.	0
And I think this is the time to inject the truth of that relationship in the process of deciding what we should be doing in the future.	0
The president, can he order the declassification on his own?	0
Yes.	0
The president has the full responsibility and the authority to do so.	0
And I hope that he will do so and again, not only for these 28 pages, but there are 80,000 documents in a federal courtroom in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, relative to an investigation that took place on a relationship between Mohamed Atta, the leader of the 19--	0
Right.	0
--and two of his henchmen, and a prominent Saudi family living in Sarasota.	0
On a scale of one to ten, the release of these pages, how would you rate the impact on U.S. - Saudi relations if they go public?	0
7.838.	0
Very accurate there.	0
So pretty, you think it will have a high level negative impact?	0
Yes.	0
All right, Senator Bob Graham, I'm going to leave it there.	0
You'll see, you think you'll get it done?	0
You think you'll get these released?	0
I think so.	0
The President's staff at least has said that they will make a decision by June.	0
And I hope that decision is to honor the American people and make it available.	0
Senator Bob Graham, thanks for coming in.	0
Good to see you, sir.	0
Thanks, Chuck.	0
We'll be back in just 45 seconds, a little endgame segment.	0
And the game that at least gets played late in presidential primary campaign, veep stakes.	0
It's a weird one this year.	0
Who will Hillary Clinton pick as a running mate?	0
We'll be right back.	0
Endgame time, the panel is here.	0
Boy, part of me wants to delve more into the Saudi thing.	0
You know, there's a lot there.	0
But let's go to The New York Times threw out the first of the veepstakes when it comes to at least Hillary Clinton.	0
And I think we have an idea of what the Hillary Clinton short list is, and then the people that they have to publicly say they're vetting.	0
"Let me put up the first five that were mentioned, because this feels like an actual Clinton official saying, ""This is who the first five preferences are."""	0
The two Virginia senators and former governors, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, obvious Virginia swing state.	0
Sherrod Brown, progressive activist, and from a swing state in Ohio.	0
Former Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, somebody that many Obama people wish ran for president.	0
And the Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who Joy, I want to start with you, and I want to start with him.	0
Because he has basically earned his way onto the Clinton campaign's decision to make him on the shortlist.	0
This came from a Clinton official.	0
And it was Perez that they put on there initially.	0
You're not hearing as much about Julián Castro, the HUD secretary that everybody fell in love with as the Latino V.P.	0
of the future.	0
Yeah, and I think with Julián Castro, I think maybe the idea of the age, sort of the juxtaposition of him with Hillary Clinton,	0
Too much so?	0
Tom Perez is somebody is very much respected by Obama world, clearly.	0
"And so I think that there is this thinking that either the Clinton campaign, in just in sort of talking to the Clinton world, that they either feel like they need to have a Latino to pair with him, to galvanize the Latino electorate, or they need to fix what you could call their ""white male"" problem."	0
And go with somebody that is a progressive white male like a Sherrod Brown or like an Al Franken even, somebody like that that would be outside the box that could help her there.	0
"Let me put up, I should put on that the Clinton campaign then said, ""Oh sure, we might look at Elizabeth Warren."""	0
She's on this list.	0
There were other names that were thrown on there, Julián Castro, Elizabeth Warren, I think publicly have to get vetted for political reasons.	0
Somebody threw out an Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker, senator from New Jersey.	0
And then there was Bill Nelson, which I may have made, and it seemed to be thrown in there, Jose, you're the Floridian here, but it was--	0
For Florida.	0
For Florida, but it was thrown in for another reason.	0
Apparently, Hillary Clinton loves the idea that both Bush and Obama have had running mates who basically were not going to pursue the presidency while being vice president.	0
And she kind of liked that.	0
That's interesting.	0
I think Ross Perot said when he was running for president that in his corporate life, he never hired anybody who didn't want his job, because that's the way they all grew.	0
This is the antithesis of that.	0
You don't want to hire someone who wants your job.	0
And maybe that would be someone like Senator Nelson of Florida.	0
But don't rule out Secretary Castro either.	0
He's an extremely charismatic person.	0
And I've got to tell you something, Tim Kaine speaks perfect Spanish, reaches out to the community through, the Hispanic community through Telemundo regularly.	0
These are people who may be hidden, have hidden weapons.	0
I'm hoping it's Brown, because I can do a Sherrod Brown.	0
Just for impersonation.	0
Deval Patrick though, that was intriguing to me.	0
The identity politics just reek of incredible cynicism to me.	0
Oh, and you don't think we're going to see identity politics on your side?	0
Well listen, the debate on the Republican side isn't who will they pick, it's who would do it.	0
I mean, I'm sorry, we're in a totally different place.	0
Being honest.	0
But the identity, this is where Republicans pull their hair, there's such an opportunity on the Republican side, because this is all about identity politics.	0
It feels very cynical, it feels very Clinton-esque.	0
"Wait a minute, the entire Marco Rubio boomlet was about identity politics and about saying, ""If we just throw a Latino at the electorate, it will mesmerize Hispanics."""	0
You saw how it ended, Joy.	0
Republicans don't fall for it.	0
But Republicans ostentatiously did identity politics.	0
Well no, I think she's right.	0
The leadership did, the voters rejected it.	0
Robert, where is running mate going on the Republican side?	0
In 1976, Ronald Reagan running against the incumbent president, Gerald Ford, picked Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania heading into the convention.	0
Down at the RNC, a lot of the RNC members and campaign associates were saying Cruz and Kasich are considering picking a running mate heading into Cleveland to try to get a bounce for their campaigns.	0
All right.	0
Well, that is going to be fun.	0
We get four veepstakes instead of two.	0
Anyway you guys are terrific.	0
I appreciate it.	0
Finally though, in memory of Prince, Bruce Springsteen started his show last night by playing a Prince classic, Purple Rain.	0
So we're going to end our broadcast the same way, with Bruce playing Prince.	0
And of course, as always if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.	0
Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.	0
People have asked me why I am running for President.	0
I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.	0
We come to work together and turn visions into reality.	0
We think big, and then we make it happen.	0
I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.	0
So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.	0
When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton – only by me.	0
The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!	0
Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be.	0
But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.	0
We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.	0
The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.	0
That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans.	0
Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.	0
Because it's not just the political system that's rigged.	0
It's the whole economy.	0
It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.	0
It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.	0
It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.	0
It's rigged against you, the American people.	0
Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –   just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.	1
Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.	0
Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses.	0
But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars.	0
I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.	0
That is a talent our country desperately needs.	0
I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.	0
We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.	0
This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.	0
Here is my promise to the American voter:   If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.	0
The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.	0
Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.	0
She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.	0
Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.	0
Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.	0
They totally own her, and that will never change.	0
The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.	0
Those are the stakes.	0
Hillary Clinton wants to be President.	0
But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.	0
She believes she is entitled to the office.	0
"Her campaign slogan is ""I'm with her."""	0
You know what my response to that is?	0
I'm with you: the American people.	0
She thinks it's all about her.	0
I know it's all about you – I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.	0
Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.	0
We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what's good for America's middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.	0
We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.	0
This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.	0
This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.	0
We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.	0
That's what we mean by America First.	0
Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.	0
"Our Founders understood this. One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for ""the encouragement and protection of manufactur"	0
[ing]	0
in America.	0
"Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:   The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."""	0
I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.	0
Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.	1
We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.	1
Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.	0
Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day.	1
Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.	1
In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!	0
The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.	0
She gets rich making you poor.	0
"Here is a quote from the book: ""At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters."""	0
These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.	0
She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.	0
Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.	0
Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.	1
She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)	1
But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.	0
She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.	0
I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.	0
We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.	0
It's not just our economy that's been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.	0
The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars – and unleashed ISIS across the world.	0
No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.	0
Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.	0
Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens.	0
He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that's right, when the phone rang at 3 o'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.	1
Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.	1
Hillary Clinton's State Department refused them all.	1
She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.	0
To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.	0
"Here is what one of the victim's mothers had to say:   ""I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don't want this person to be president."""	0
In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.	0
Libya was cooperating.	0
Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.	0
Syria was under control.	0
Iran was being choked by sanctions.	0
Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.	0
ISIS wasn't even on the map.	0
Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed   to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.	0
Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.	0
Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.	0
Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen – while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.	0
She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood.	0
The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora's box of radical Islam.	0
Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.	0
ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.	0
ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.	0
In short, Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.	0
It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.	0
Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.	1
But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn't wait to rush us off to war in Libya.	0
She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.	0
"In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:   ""She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasn't changed a bit."""	0
Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.	0
In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that's an increase over President Obama's already very high number.	1
Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth – with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.	1
Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.	1
The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.	0
I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.	0
Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.	0
Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.	0
Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.	0
Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:   A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes.	0
So what did this company do?	0
For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech.	0
The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.	0
Hillary Clinton's State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America's uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.	0
Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access – even though he had no national security credentials.	0
Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State – plus millions more for her foundation.	0
The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay.	0
The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary's Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance.	0
Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.	1
Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.	1
To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.	0
Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger.	0
Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.	0
While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.	0
So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.	0
This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.	0
We can't hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.	0
National security is also immigration security – and Hillary wants neither.	0
Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.	0
She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.	1
The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs.	0
They are the ones she will hurt the most.	0
Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.	0
She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.	0
Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.	0
"Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza's letter:   ""Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms' way – an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country."	0
Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her.	0
"She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country."""	0
Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.	0
For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.	1
Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work.	0
She can't claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.	0
Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:   Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution.	0
Hillary Clinton's radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment.	0
Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs   Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many   Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas   Lift restrictions on energy production   Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster.	0
Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs.	1
Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State.	0
There is one common theme in all of these reforms.	0
It's going to be America First.	0
This is why the stakes in November are so great.	0
On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.	0
The voters are the jury.	0
Their ballots are the verdict.	0
We don't need or want another Clinton or Obama.	0
Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.	0
They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.	0
Hillary Clinton's message is old and tired.	0
Her message is that can't change.	0
My message is that things have to change – and this is our one chance do it.	0
This is our last chance to do it.	0
Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.	0
Then we started thinking small.	0
We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.	0
We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.	0
But that's not who we are.	0
Come this November, we can bring America back – bigger and better, and stronger than ever.	0
We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth – the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.	0
Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment – we will bring it back all the way.	1
Massive new factories will come roaring into our country – breathing life and hope into our communities.	0
Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.	0
Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.	0
The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs.	1
Hillary's massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.	0
We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.	0
I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.	0
Our country is going to start working again.	0
People are going to start working again.	0
Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again – including parents in our inner cities.	0
Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.	0
We are going to make America rich again.	0
We are going to make America safe again.	0
We are going to make America Great Again – and Great Again For EVERYONE.	0
Mr. President, I know you're only five days in.	0
Has it changed you?	0
I don't want to change too much.	0
I've had a wonderful life and wonderful success.	0
I want to make this a great success for the American people and for the people that put me in this position.	0
So I don't want to change too much.	0
I can be the most presidential person ever, other than possibly the great Abe Lincoln, all right?	0
But I can be the most presidential person.	0
But I may not be able to do the job nearly as well if I do that.	0
Your predecessor used to talk often about finishing the day to get to his family upstairs -- the stairwell's right over here -- to have dinner with them.	0
And I know that the first lady, Melania, has a big job back in New York taking care of Barron.	0
She does, yes.	0
Does it make it a lonely place for you at the end of the day?	0
No, because I end up working longer.	0
And that's OK.	0
I -- I mean, I'm working long hours.	0
I mean, the country has a lot of problems.	0
[Voiceover]	0
He says a lot of problems, and President Trump tonight on the controversial moves he's made already.	0
Mr. President, I want to start -- we're five days in.	0
And your campaign promises, I know today you plan on signing the order to build the wall.	0
Correct.	0
Are you going to direct U.S. funds to pay for this wall?	0
Will American taxpayers pay for the wall?	0
Ultimately, it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico.	0
We're going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon.	0
And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico, which I've always said...	0
So they'll pay us back?	0
Yeah, absolutely, 100 percent, yes.	0
So the American taxpayer will pay for the wall at first?	0
All it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico.	0
Now, I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall.	0
But I want to build the wall.	0
We have to build the wall.	0
We have to stop drugs from pouring in.	0
We have to stop people from just pouring into our country.	0
We have no idea where they're from.	0
And I campaigned on the wall.	0
And it's very important.	0
But that wall will cost us nothing.	0
But you talked often about Mexico paying for the wall.	0
And you, again, say they'll pay us back.	0
"Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay, adding that, It goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans."""	0
He says	0
Well, I think he has -- David, I think he has to say that.	0
He has to say that.	0
But I'm just telling you, there will be a payment.	0
It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form.	0
And you have to understand, what I'm doing is good for the United States.	0
It's also going to be good for Mexico.	0
What are you going to say to some of your supporters who might say, Wait a minute	0
Well, I'd say very simply that they are going to pay for it.	0
I never said they're going to pay from the start.	0
I said Mexico will pay for the wall.	0
When does construction begin?	0
As soon as we can.	0
As soon as we can physically do it, we're -- we're...	0
Within months?	0
I would say in months, yeah.	0
I would say in months.	0
Certainly, planning is starting immediately.	0
I want to ask about undocumented immigrants who are here in this country.	0
Right now, they're protected as so-called Dreamers, the children who were brought here, as you know, by their parents.	0
Should they be worried that they could be deported?	0
And is there anything you can say to assure them right now that they'll be allowed to stay?	0
They shouldn't be very worried.	0
They are here illegally.	0
They shouldn't be very worried.	0
I do have a big heart.	0
We're going to take care of everybody.	0
We're going to have a very strong border.	0
We're going to have a very solid border.	0
Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried.	0
We'll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks.	0
So, Mr. President, will they be allowed to stay?	0
I'm going to tell you over the next four weeks.	0
I want to ask you about something you said this week right here at the White House.	0
You brought in congressional leaders to the White House.	0
You spoke at length about the presidential election with them, telling them that you lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal votes, 3 million to 5 million illegal votes.	0
That would be the biggest electoral fraud in American history.	0
Where is the evidence of that?	0
So, let me tell you, first of all, it was so misrepresented.	0
That was supposed to be a confidential meeting.	0
And you weren't supposed to go out and talk to the press as soon as you -- but the Democrats viewed it not as a confidential meeting.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
But you have tweeted about the millions of illegal...	0
Let me -- sure.	0
And I do -- and I'm very -- and I mean it.	0
But just so you know, it was supposed to be a confidential meeting.	0
They turned it into not a -- number two, the conversation lasted for about a minute.	0
They made it -- somebody said it was, like, 25 percent of the -- it wasn't.	0
It was hardly even discussed.	0
I said it.	0
And I said it strongly, because what's going on with voter fraud is horrible.	0
That's number one.	0
Number two, I would've won the popular vote if I was campaigning for the popular vote.	0
I would've gone to California, where I didn't go at all.	0
I would've gone to New York, where I didn't campaign at all.	0
I would've gone to a couple of places that I didn't go to.	0
And I would've won that much easier than winning the Electoral College.	0
But as you know, the Electoral College is all that matters.	0
It doesn't make any difference.	0
With that being said, if you look at voter registration, you look at the dead people that are registered to vote who vote, you look at people that are registered in two states, you look at all of these different things that are happening with registration, you take a look at those registration for -- you're going to find -- and we're going to do an investigation on it...	1
But three to five million illegal votes?	0
Well, we're going to find out.	0
But it could very well be that much.	0
You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states.	1
You have people registered in two states.	0
They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey.	0
They vote twice.	1
There are millions of votes, in my opinion.	0
Now...	0
But again...	0
I'm going to do an investigation.	0
Now, David, David...	0
You're now president of the United States.	0
I'm -- well, of course.	0
I want the voting process to be legitimate.	0
But what I'm asking -- what I'm asking...	0
People that...	0
When you say in your opinion millions of illegal votes, that is something that is extremely fundamental to our functioning democracy, a fair and free election.	1
Sure.	0
Sure.	0
Sure.	0
You say you're going to launch an investigation.	0
Sure.	0
Done.	0
What you have presented so far has been debunked.	0
It's been called false.	0
No, it hasn't.	0
Take a look at the Pew reports.	0
I called the author of the Pew report last night.	0
And he told me that they found no evidence of voter fraud.	1
Really?	0
Then why did he write the report?	0
He said no evidence of voter fraud.	0
Excuse me.	0
Then why did he write the report?	0
So I guess I'm...	0
According to Pew report.	0
Then he's -- then he's groveling again.	0
You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they want to write something that you want to hear, but not necessarily millions of people want to hear, or have to hear.	0
This is...	0
So you've launched an investigation?	0
We're going to launch an investigation to find out.	0
And then the next time -- and -- and I will say this.	0
Of those votes cast, none of them come to me.	0
None of them come to me.	0
They would all be for the other side.	0
None of them come to me.	0
But when you look at the people that are registered: dead, illegal, and two states.	0
And some cases, maybe three states?	0
We have a lot to look into.	0
House Speaker Paul Ryan has said, I have seen no evidence.	0
I have made this very	0
There's nothing bigger.	0
There's nothing bigger.	0
But it is important, because you have...	0
Well, let me just tell you, you know what's important?	0
Millions of people agree with me when I say that.	0
If you would have looked on one of the other networks and all of the people that were calling in, they're saying, We agree with Mr. Trump.	0
"We agree."""	0
They're very smart people.	0
ell	0
Let me just ask you, you did win.	0
You're the president.	0
You're sitting across from me right now.	0
That's true.	0
That's true.	0
Do you think that your words matter more now?	0
Yes, very much.	0
Do you think that -- that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country...	0
No, not at all.	0
... without presenting the evidence?	0
Not at all.	0
Because many people feel the same way that I do.	0
And...	0
You don't think it undermines your credibility if there's no evidence?	1
No, not at all.	0
Because they wouldn't -- they didn't come to me, believe me.	1
Those were Hillary votes.	0
Mr. President, I just have one more question on this.	0
Yes.	0
And it's -- it's -- it's bigger picture.	0
You -- you took some heat -- after your visit to the CIA, in front of that hallowed wall, 117 stars -- of those lost at the CIA, you talked about other things, but you also talked about crowd size at the inauguration, about the size of your rallies, about covers on Time magazine.	0
And I just want to ask you, when does all of that matter just a little less?	0
When do you let it roll off your back now that you're the president?	0
OK, so I'm glad you asked.	0
So I went to the CIA, my first stop.	0
I have great respect for the people in intelligence and CIA.	0
I don't have a lot of respect for in particular one of the leaders.	0
But that's OK.	0
But I have a lot of respect for the people in the CIA.	0
That speech was a homerun.	0
That speech, if you look at Fox, OK, I'll mention your network -- read -- see what Fox said.	0
They said it was one of the great speeches.	0
They showed the people applauding and screaming and -- and they were all CIA.	0
There was nobody -- somebody was asking Sean, Well	0
And you would give the same speech if you went back?	0
Absolutely.	0
In front of that wall?	0
It was great.	0
People loved it.	0
They loved it.	0
They gave me a standing ovation for a long period of time.	0
They never even sat down, most of them, during the speech.	0
There was love in the room.	0
You and other networks covered it very inaccurately.	0
I hate to say this to you, and you probably won't put it on, but turn on Fox and see how it was covered and see how people respond to that speech.	0
That speech was a good speech.	0
And you and a couple of other networks tried to downplay that speech.	0
And it was very, very unfortunate that you did.	0
I am curious about the first full day here at the White House, choosing to send the press secretary out into the briefing room, summoning reporters to talk about the inaugural crowd size.	0
Does that send a message to the American people that that's -- that's more important than some of the very pressing issues?	0
Part of my whole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again.	0
"Part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly -- because we had a massive crowd of people -- we -- we had a crowd -- I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, Wow."""	0
And I've seen crowds before.	0
Big	0
When I looked at the numbers that happened to come in from all of the various sources, we had the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches.	0
I said, the men and women that I was talking to who came out and voted will never be forgotten again.	0
Therefore, I won't allow you or other people like you to demean that crowd and to demean the people that came to Washington, D.C., from faraway places because they like me.	0
But more importantly, they like what I'm saying.	0
[Voiceover]	0
When we come back, what the president revealed to us about torture and waterboarding.	0
You're now the president.	0
Do you want waterboarding?	0
[Voiceover]	0
What President Trump is now saying tonight, already generating headlines.	0
And our walk through the White House.	0
What it was like being handed the nuclear codes.	0
And his new office.	0
So we're in the Oval Office.	0
This is the Oval Office.	0
[Voiceover]	0
What he shows us, and a letter President Obama left for President Trump, when we come back.	0
[Commercial Break]	0
Mr. Trump, let's talk about many of the things that have happened this week.	0
Chicago, last night, you tweeted about the murder rate in Chicago, saying, If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on	0
Right.	0
You will send in the feds.	0
What do you mean by that?	0
It's carnage.	0
You know, in my speech, I got tremendous -- from certain people, the word carnage.	0
It is carnage.	0
It's horrible carnage.	0
This is -- Afghanistan is not like what's happening in Chicago.	0
People are being shot left and right.	0
Thousands of people over a period -- over a short period of time.	0
This year, which has just started, is worse than last year, which was a catastrophe.	0
They're not doing the job.	0
Now, if they want help, I would love to help them.	0
I will send in what we have to send in.	0
Maybe they're not going to have to be so politically correct.	0
Maybe they're being overly political correct?	0
Maybe there's something going on?	0
But you can't have those killings going on in Chicago.	0
Chicago is like a warzone.	0
Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report, in some of the places that you report about every night, in the Middle East.	0
So I will -- you mention federal assistance.	0
There's federal assistance, and then there's sending in the feds.	0
I'm just curious, will you take action on your own?	0
I want them to fix the problem.	0
You can't have thousands of people being shot in a city, in a country that I happen to be president of.	0
Maybe it's OK if somebody else is president.	0
I want them to fix the problem.	0
They have a problem that's very easily fixable.	0
They're going to have to get tougher and stronger and smarter, but they got to fix the problem.	0
I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where, essentially, I'm the president.	0
I love Chicago.	0
I know Chicago.	0
And Chicago is a great city.	0
It can be a great city.	0
It can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread.	0
It can't be a great city.	0
And if they are unable to fix it, that's when you would send in the feds?	0
Well, so far they have been unable -- it's been going on for years.	0
And I wasn't president.	0
What's going on?	0
So all I'm saying is, to the mayor, who came up to my office recently, I say, you have to smarten up and you have to toughen up.	0
Because you can't let that happen.	0
That's a warzone.	0
This is a warning.	0
I want them to straighten out the problem.	0
It's a big problem.	0
Let me ask you about a new report that you are poised to lift a ban on so-called CIA black sites, prisons around the world that have been used in the past.	0
Is that true?	0
Well, I'll be talking about that in about two hours.	0
Are you going to lift the ban?	0
You're going to see in about two hours.	0
[Voiceover]	0
Tonight, we are still waiting for word from the Trump White House on any decision involving those so-called black sites.	0
The last president, President Obama, said the U.S. does not torture.	0
Will you say that?	0
Well, I have a general who I have great respect for, General Mattis, who said -- I was a little surprised -- who said he's not a believer in torture.	0
As you know, Mr. Pompeo was just approved, affirmed by the Senate.	0
He's a fantastic guy.	0
He's going to be the head of the CIA.	0
And you will have somebody fabulous, as opposed to the character that just got out who didn't -- was not fabulous at all.	0
And he will, I think, do a great job.	0
And he is, you know -- I haven't gone into great detail, but I will tell you, I have spoken to others in intelligence and they are big believers in, as an example, waterboarding.	0
You did tell me...	0
Because they say it does work.	0
It does work.	0
Mr. President...	0
Now, personally...	0
Mr. President, you told me during one of the debates that you would bring back waterboarding and a hell of a lot worse, in your words.	0
Yeah.	0
I would do -- what I would do -- I want to keep our country safe.	0
I want to keep our country safe.	0
What does that mean?	0
When they're shooting, when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they are chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding?	0
As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire.	0
Now, with that being said, I'm going with General Mattis.	0
I'm going with my secretary, because I think Pompeo is going to be phenomenon.	0
I'm going to go with what they say.	0
But I have spoken, as recently as 24 hours ago, with people at the highest level of intelligence, and I asked them the question.	0
Does it work?	0
Does torture work?	0
And the answer was: Yes, absolutely.	1
You're now the president.	0
Do you want waterboarding?	0
I don't want people to chop off the citizens' or anybody's heads in the Middle East, OK?	0
Because they're Christian or Muslim or anything else.	0
I don't want -- look, you are old enough to have seen a time that was much different.	0
You never saw heads chopped off until a few years ago.	0
Now they chop them off, and they put them on camera, and they send them all over the world.	0
So we have that.	0
And we're not allowed to do anything.	0
We're not playing on an even field.	0
I will say this.	0
I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group.	0
And if they don't want to do, that's fine.	0
If they do want to do, then I will work toward that end.	0
I want to do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally.	0
But do I feel it works?	0
Absolutely, I feel it works.	0
So you'd be OK with that as president?	0
I want to keep -- no, I want to -- no, I will rely on General Mattis, and I am going to rely on those two people and others.	0
And if they don't want to do it, it's 100 percent OK with me.	0
Do I think it works?	0
Absolutely.	0
[Voiceover]	0
We head outside to the colonnade where we discussed what happened shortly after President Trump took the oath of office.	0
This is the famous walk you've seen so many presidents...	0
Right, so many.	0
It's amazing.	0
Let me ask you.	0
"Right after the oath of office, they give you the nuclear codes, the biscuit."""	0
Sobering moment?	0
et me ask you.	0
"Right after the"""	0
When they explained what it represents and the kind of destruction that you're talking about, it is a very sobering moment, yes.	0
It's very, very -- very scary, in a sense.	0
Does it keep you up at night?	0
No.	0
But it's -- confident that I'll do the right thing.	0
The right job.	0
But it's a very, very scary thing.	0
Every president does get asked, though, what keeps them awake, what's unsettling.	0
What has been most unsettling for you now that you're five days in?	0
Well, I think I see a tremendous amount of waste.	0
I see a tremendous amount of job opportunities that have been let go for many years, and I'm not just talking about President Obama.	0
I'm talking about for many, many years.	0
And I was a big, big fan of Ronald Reagan, but I was a never big fan on trade with respect to Ronald Reagan.	0
So the economy...	0
I just think we've had years and years of allowing our jobs to be dissipated in this country, and there's no reason for it.	0
So the economy keeps you up more than terrorism and homeland security?	0
I view it all the same.	0
You do?	0
Donald Trump	0
[Voiceover]	0
When we come back, what the president says about plans for sweeping executive action suspending immigration from certain countries.	0
Is this the Muslim ban?	0
[Voiceover]	0
And here at home, we ask the president about the millions of Americans who are concerned they could lose their health care if Obamacare is repealed.	0
Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less?	0
[Voiceover]	0
And the March, the more than a million protesters, women, men, children, across this country, we ask what the president would say to them tonight.	0
[Commercial Break]	0
Mr. President, I want to ask you about refugees.	0
You're about to sign a sweeping executive action to suspend immigration to this country.	0
Right.	0
Who are we talking about?	0
Is this the Muslim ban?	0
We're talking about -- no, it's not the Muslim ban, but it's countries that have tremendous terror.	0
And it's countries that people are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems.	0
Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in, who in many cases, or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction.	0
Which countries are we talking about?	0
You look at what's happened - I have a whole list.	0
You will be very thrilled.	0
You're looking at people that come in, in many cases, in some cases with evil intentions.	0
I don't want that.	0
They're ISIS.	0
They're coming under false pretense.	0
I don't want that.	0
I'm going to be the president of a safe country.	0
We have enough problems.	0
Now, I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people.	0
I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries.	0
And all you have to do is take a look.	0
It's -- it's a disaster what's happening over there.	0
I don't want that to happen here.	0
Now, with that being said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have a -- and Kerry -- have allowed tens of thousands of people into our country.	0
The FBI is now investigating more people than ever before having to do with terror.	0
They -- and it's from the group of people that came in.	0
So, look, look, our country has a lot of problems, believe me.	0
I know what the problems are even better than you do.	0
They're deep problems.	0
They're serious problems.	0
We don't need more. Let me ask you about some of the countries that won't be on the list: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
You're going to see.	0
You're going to see.	0
We're going to have extreme vetting in all cases.	0
And I mean extreme.	0
And we're not letting people in if we think there's even a little chance of some problem.	0
Are you at all...	0
Because we are -- we are excluding certain countries, but for other countries, we're going to have extreme vetting.	0
It's going to be very hard to come in.	0
Right now, it's very easy to come in.	1
It's going to be very, very hard.	0
I don't want terror in this country.	0
You look at what happened in San Bernardino.	0
You look at what happened all over.	0
You look at what happened in the World Trade Center, OK?	0
I mean, take that as an example.	0
People don't even bring that up.	0
Are you at all concerned -- are you at all concerned it's going to cause more anger among Muslims around the world?	0
Anger?	0
There's plenty of anger right now.	0
How can you have more?	0
You don't think it will exacerbate the problem?	0
Look, look, David, David, I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy.	0
The world is a mess.	0
The world is as angry as it gets.	0
What, you think this is going to cause a little more anger?	0
The world is an angry place.	0
All of this has happened.	0
We went into Iraq.	0
We shouldn't have gone into Iraq.	0
We shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.	0
The world is a total mess.	0
The world is a mess, David.	0
You brought up Iraq and something you said that could affect American troops in recent days.	0
You said, We should have kept the oil	0
Well, we should have kept the oil when we got out.	0
And you know, it's very interesting.	0
Had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because they fuel themselves with the oil.	0
That's where they got the money.	0
So you believe we can go in and take the oil?	0
We should have taken the oil.	0
You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil.	0
You've heard the critics who say that would break all international law, taking the oil.	0
But I want to get to the words that you said...	0
Can you believe that?	0
Wait a minute.	0
Can you believe that?	0
Who are the critics that say that?	0
Fools.	0
I don't call them critics.	0
I call them fools.	0
Let me talk about your words...	0
We should have kept -- excuse me.	0
We should have taken the oil.	0
And if we took the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, and we would have had wealth.	0
We have spent, right now, $6 trillion in the Middle East, and our country is falling apart.	0
It's not right.	0
What got my attention, Mr. President, was when you said maybe we'll have another chance.	0
Well, don't let it get your attention too much, because we'll see what happens.	0
I mean, we're going to see what happens.	0
You know, I told you and I told everybody else that wants to talk, when it comes to the military, I don't want to discuss things.	0
I want to let -- I want to let the action take place before the talk takes place.	0
I watched in Mosul, when -- a number of months ago, generals and politicians would get up and say, we're going into Mosul in four months.	0
Then they'd say we're going in, in three months, two months, one month, we're going in next week.	0
OK. And I kept saying to myself, gee, why do they have to keep talking about going in?	0
All right.	0
So now they go in, and it is tough, because they've given the enemy all this time to prepare.	0
I don't want to do a lot of talking on the military.	0
I want to talk after it's finished, not before it starts.	0
[Voiceover]	0
When we come back, the millions of Americans who want to know what the replacement will be for Obamacare.	0
I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.	0
We -- here's what I can assure you.	0
[Voiceover]	0
And later, the moment in the Oval Office, President Trump revealing the conversation with President Obama, as they got into the motorcade, sharing that ride to the Capitol.	0
What was that car ride like to the Capitol?	0
[Voiceover]	0
When we come back.	0
[Commercial Break]	0
Let me ask you, Mr. President, about another promise involving Obamacare, to repeal it.	0
And you told the Washington Post that your plan to replace Obamacare will include insurance for everybody.	0
That sounds an awful lot like universal coverage.	0
It's going to be -- what my plan is, is that I want to take care of everybody.	0
I'm not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance.	0
Just so you understand, people talk about Obamacare, and I told the Republicans this.	0
The best thing we can do is nothing for two years, let it explode, and then we'll go in and we'll do a new plan and the Democrats will vote for it, believe me.	0
Because this year, you'll have 150 percent increases.	0
Last year, in Arizona, 116 percent increase.	0
Minnesota, sixty some odd percent increase.	0
And I told them -- except for one problem.	0
I want to get it fixed.	0
The best thing I could do as the leader of this country, but as wanting to get something approved with support of the Democrats, if I didn't do anything for two years, they'd be begging me to do something.	0
But I don't want to do that.	0
So just so you -- Obamacare is a disaster.	0
It's too expensive.	0
It's horrible health care.	0
It doesn't cover what you have to cover.	0
It's a disaster.	0
I said to the Republican folks, and they're terrific folks, Mitch and Paul Ryan.	0
I said, look, if you go fast -- and I'm OK in doing it, because it's the right thing to do -- we want to get good coverage at much less cost -- I said, if you go fast, we then own Obamacare.	0
They're going to put it on us.	0
And Obamacare is a disaster waiting to explode.	0
If you sit back and let it explode, it's going to be much easier.	0
That's the thing to do.	0
But the right thing to do is to get something done now.	0
I want to make sure that nobody's dying on the streets when I'm president.	0
You've seen the estimate that 18 million Americans could lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed and there is no replacement.	0
Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less?	0
So nobody ever deducts all the people that have already lost their health insurance that liked it.	0
You had millions of people that liked their health insurance and their healthcare and their doctor and where they went.	0
You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore.	0
I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.	0
No, no, we -- here's what I can assure you.	0
We are going to have a better plan, much better health care, much better service treatment, a plan where you can have access to the doctor that you want and the plan that you want.	0
We're going to have a much better health care plan at much less money.	0
We're going to have an explosion.	0
And to do it right, sit back, let it explode, and let the Democrats come begging us to help them, because it's on them.	0
But I don't want to do that.	0
I want to give great health care at a much lower cost.	0
So no one who has this health insurance through Obamacare will lose it or end up with anything less?	0
Well, you know, when you say no one, I think no one.	0
Ideally, in the real world, you're talking about millions of people -- will no one?	0
And then, you know, knowing ABC, you'll have this one person on television saying how they were hurt.	0
OK. We want no one.	0
We want the answer to be no one.	0
But I will say: Millions of people will be happy.	0
Right now, you have millions and millions and millions of people that are unhappy.	0
[Voiceover]	0
And as we walked through the White House, we asked the president about the voices, just outside in Washington, D.C., and across the country, the more than a million women, men and children who marched the day after the inauguration.	0
Let me just ask you while we're standing outside.	0
Could you hear the voices from the women's march here in Washington?	0
We know there were more than a million people who turned out.	0
And you are their president now, too.	0
It's true.	0
Could you hear them from the White House?	0
No, I couldn't hear them.	0
But the crowds were large, but you're going to have a large crowd on Friday, too, which is mostly pro-life people.	0
You're going to have a lot of people coming on Friday.	0
And I will say this -- and I didn't realize this, but I was told -- you will have a very large crowd of people.	0
I don't know, as large or larger.	0
Some people say it's going to be larger, pro-life people, and they say the press doesn't cover them.	0
I don't want to compare crowd sizes again.	0
No, you shouldn't.	0
But let me just say, what they do say is that the press doesn't cover them.	0
We saw the marches around the country.	0
And you are their president now.	0
Do you sense the responsibility to reach out now and to unite them?	0
And for those women, men, children who marched who are watching this, what would you say to them?	0
Well, I do, but I have to also say: We just had an election a few weeks ago.	0
And they voted, in many cases, and some cases, they didn't vote, I imagine.	0
And we did have an election.	0
With that being said, absolutely I have responsibility to everybody, including people that didn't vote for  Trump.	0
Totally.	0
This is the Oval Office.	0
[Voiceover]	0
When we come back, President Trump takes us into the Oval Office.	0
What moves you the most about this room?	0
[Voiceover]	0
The president on what he's changed already here.	0
And the letter left by President Obama and the phone call after reading it, when we come back.	0
[Commercial Break]	0
So we're in the Oval Office.	0
This is the Oval Office.	0
This is truly one of the great spaces.	0
And I bring people in from General Motors and from Ford and the biggest people, and I bring in the labor leaders, and the people that are in the labor movement.	0
And they walk into this room, and they just want to take it in.	0
They could stand here for an hour just taking it in.	0
What moves you the most about this room?	0
Just the history of it.	0
The importance of it.	0
What's happened here.	0
I actually put some pictures up that I thought would be great.	0
Some of the paintings that I thought would be really appropriate, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, who a lot of people, they compare the campaign of Trump with, the campaign of -- you have to go back to 1828, but that seems to be a comparison for, you know, certain obvious reasons.	0
But we put some of these up.	0
And we're standing on -- we're standing on Ronald Reagan's rug?	0
This was Ronald Reagan's.	0
And you have a choice, you know, when you come in.	0
They have eight or nine carpets.	0
They have different furniture.	0
The desk is...	0
The resolute desk.	0
Yes.	0
Yes.	0
It's the resolute desk.	0
This is actually very nice.	0
This is actually a couple of things that are interesting.	0
This was given to me by one of the combatants that I fought to get here, and Adams versus Jefferson, and this book, they say this was the most vicious campaign ever fought for president until this.	0
Who gave this to you?	0
Somebody.	0
A combatant.	0
And this was the letter given to me by President Obama.	0
We saw that image of him the final morning that he was here putting the letter on the desk.	0
Which was -- I won't show it to you or read it to you.	0
But a -- just a beautiful letter.	0
Is there a line you can share that struck you most?	0
There were numerous lines.	0
So well-written.	0
So thoughtful.	0
So thoughtful.	0
And in the drawer, you know, put in the drawer, which is a custom, but I doubt too many of them were written in this manner.	0
He really -- in fact, I called him and thanked him for the thought that was put into that letter.	0
I have to say, I have looked at a lot of those presidential letters that they have left for the next president.	0
That one looks a lot longer than the ones that I have seen.	0
It was long, it was complex, it was thoughtful, and it took time to do it, and I appreciated it.	0
And I called him and thanked him.	0
Was there something he said in that letter that surprised you?	0
Well, I think nothing that surprised me, but it was stated beautifully.	0
But -- and I'm representing a lot of people, and I'm carrying on a very important tradition, and just do a great job.	0
He wants me to do a great job.	0
He said something that was very interesting to me.	0
He said, you know, if I thought your health care plan was going to be better than his plan, Obamacare, I would support it, and I believe he would.	0
I believe he would.	0
What was that car ride like to the Capitol, when you got into the car with the president who was about to leave, and you were about to...	0
The amazing thing to me -- and he may say differently -- is that we I think have sort of a great relationship, and yet it was a vicious campaign, and vicious things were said by him and by me about each other.	0
I mean, he said that, you know, I would never represent the Republican Party.	0
Then, I won, that I will never win.	0
And I said vicious things about him.	0
It was a very -- you know, you talk about Jefferson and Adams.	0
This was rough.	0
And Hillary had a great asset on her side, him and Michelle, who is a phenomenal person.	0
But Hillary had these two people that were really campaigning, big league.	0
In fact, I was going out and campaigning -- you know, really complaining about it.	0
I was saying, not really fair.	0
But to have that kind of vitriol, to have that kind of stuff going on, and then we're riding in a car together up Pennsylvania Avenue, and I'm saying to myself -- I actually said to him, This is a little weird	0
But we really -- we didn't discuss the negative.	0
We only discussed the future and the positive.	0
And we really got along well.	0
Now, again, he may say differently, but I don't think he would.	0
We really got along well.	0
Mr. President, you bring up Hillary Clinton.	0
You had her stand up at Statuary Hall and said some very kind things about her.	0
She fought hard.	0
She fought hard.	0
Do you think America is done hearing about investigations into Hillary Clinton?	0
I just don't know.	0
I mean, I hope so.	0
From my standpoint, we want to move onto the future.	0
So I hope so.	0
I don't know what the status of that is.	0
I know it's a lot of very serious stuff, but I certainly hope so.	0
We have seen the amount of action at this desk already this week.	0
Right.	0
The Dow hit 20,000 today.	0
Right.	0
I'm very proud of that.	0
Very proud of that.	0
The business community and the labor community, you saw that with the labor leaders that came out.	0
One of them said it was the single greatest meeting I've ever had with anybody, it's the highlight of my life.	0
And the Dow on top of it just hit 20,000.	0
First time in history.	0
I'm very proud of that.	0
Now, we have to go up, up, up.	0
We don't want it to stay there.	0
That's the challenge, Mr. President.	0
That's going to be the challenge, but it's gone up a lot since I won.	0
Don't forget, when I won, people thought, oh, maybe it will go down.	0
But the business world doesn't think that.	0
The business world knows me.	0
They don't think that.	0
And it was a steady climb.	0
And now we just hit a record and a number that's never been hit before.	0
So I was very honored by that.	0
[Voiceover]	0
The president then takes us through the West Wing to show us the photos they already have on the walls.	0
Now, these are some of the pictures that were taken.	0
This is the swearing in and the first dance with Melania.	0
Here's a picture of the event.	0
Here's a picture of the crowd.	0
Now, the audience was the biggest ever.	1
But this crowd was massive.	1
Look how far back it goes.	0
This crowd was massive.	0
And I would actually take that camera and take your time, if you want to know the truth.	0
I do want to ask you, Mr. President, about this photo right here.	0
I saw this moment on Inauguration Day.	0
I saw you put your hand on President Obama's back there, as he boarded Executive One, no longer Marine One.	0
What did you say to him?	0
I saw you smiling.	0
There is a warmth -- look, if you see that picture, there is a warmth there.	0
But that was an incredibly beautiful moment.	0
And I've seen it over the years.	0
I've seen the good and the bad.	0
But the scene of that great machine turning on and lifting off, it was really something special.	0
[Voiceover]	0
He points to an image of his daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now a senior adviser to the president.	0
Is there any chance Ivanka might have an office right here in the White House?	0
Well, right now, she is just getting settled, moved to Washington.	0
Her husband, Jared, very, very smart.	0
Good guy.	0
We know he'll have a role.	0
He has an office.	0
Right, he does.	0
And he has an office.	0
We'll have to see what happens.	0
She is a special person.	0
You're not ruling it out?	0
She's smart and she's got every quality you could possibly have.	0
I don't rule out anything.	0
No, there's certainly a possibility.	0
And Jared has been here, and he's doing a great job.	0
[Voiceover]	0
And just before we leave, the president tells us he wants to show us just one more image.	0
One thing this shows is how far over they go here.	0
Look.	0
Look how far this is.	0
This goes all the way down here.	0
All the way down.	0
Nobody sees that.	0
You don't see that in the pictures.	0
But when you look at this tremendous sea of love -- I call it a sea of love.	0
It's really something special, that all these people traveled here from all parts of the country, maybe the world, but all parts of the country.	0
Hard for them to get here.	0
Many of these people were the forgotten men and women, many of them.	0
And they loved what I had to say.	0
More importantly, they're going to love the result.	0
Mr. President.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you, David.	0
Thank you.	0
Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you very much for being here.	0
We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.	0
Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question.	0
Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first.	0
Our first question comes from Patrice Brock.	0
Patrice?	0
Thank you, and good evening.	0
The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines.	0
Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?	0
Well, thank you.	0
Are you a teacher?	0
Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.	0
And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	0
And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.	0
We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	0
I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	0
"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	0
If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.	0
So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	0
Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	0
I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	0
I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.	0
Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
Well, I actually agree with that.	0
I agree with everything she said.	0
I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.	0
This is a great country.	0
This is a great land.	0
I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.	0
I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.	0
And my whole concept was to make America great again.	0
When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.	1
When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.	0
Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	1
In other words, trading with other countries.	0
We had an $800 billion deficit.	1
It's hard to believe.	0
Inconceivable.	0
You say who's making these deals?	0
We're going the make great deals.	0
We're going to have a strong border.	0
We're going to bring back law and order.	0
Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	0
And this is happening on a weekly basis.	0
We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.	0
At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	0
We need justice.	0
But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.	0
It's called make America great again.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth?	0
We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine.	0
You called what you said locker room banter.	0
You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals.	0
That is sexual assault.	0
You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.	0
Do you understand that?	0
No, I didn't say that at all.	0
I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.	0
I'm not proud of it.	0
I apologize to my family.	0
I apologize to the American people.	0
Certainly I'm not proud of it.	0
But this is locker room talk.	0
You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.	0
We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.	0
And they look and they see.	0
Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	0
And they look at our country and they see what's going on.	0
Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	0
I hate it.	0
But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.	0
I will knock the hell out of ISIS.	0
We're going to defeat ISIS.	0
ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.	0
And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	0
So, Mr. Trump...	0
And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	0
Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?	0
I have great respect for women.	0
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
So, for the record, you're saying you never did that?	0
I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	0
And I was embarrassed by it.	0
But I have tremendous respect for women.	0
Have you ever done those things?	0
And women have respect for me.	0
And I will tell you: No, I have not.	0
And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.	0
We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.	0
People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.	0
We're going to make America safe again.	0
We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	0
And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
And that's what I want to talk about.	0
Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?	0
Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	0
You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.	0
Donald Trump is different.	0
I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.	0
And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	0
What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	0
And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.	0
But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.	0
Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.	0
We have seen him insult women.	1
We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.	0
We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.	0
We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	0
So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	0
But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	1
So this is who Donald Trump is.	0
And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	0
That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	0
These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.	0
And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.	0
And we want to get to some questions from online...	0
Am I allowed to respond to that?	0
I assume I am.	0
Yes, you can respond to that.	0
It's just words, folks.	0
It's just words.	0
Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.	0
I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	1
I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.	0
I'm going to help the African-Americans.	0
I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.	0
I am going to help the inner cities.	0
She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.	0
She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	0
We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.	0
She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	0
Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions.	0
So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?	0
You're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.	0
Sounds fair.	0
This tape is generating intense interest.	0
In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network.	0
As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic.	0
"Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, ""Trump says the campaign has changed him."	0
"When did that happen?"""	0
So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that.	0
When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?	0
And you have two minutes for this.	0
It was locker room talk, as I told you.	0
That was locker room talk.	0
I'm not proud of it.	0
I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	0
And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	0
But that was something that happened.	0
If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	0
Mine are words, and his was action.	0
His was what he's done to women.	0
There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.	0
So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.	0
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.	0
Four of them here tonight.	0
One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	0
Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	1
Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.	0
So don't tell me about words.	0
I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	0
But it is things that people say.	0
But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.	0
He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	0
Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.	0
And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Can we please hold the applause?	0
Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	0
Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	0
He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.	0
Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.	0
When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.	0
But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.	0
He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.	0
And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	0
"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""	0
He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	0
And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.	0
He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	0
Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.	1
So you really owe him an apology.	0
You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.	0
That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	0
Number two, Michelle Obama.	0
I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.	0
And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.	0
So, you talk about friend?	0
Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.	0
And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	0
And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.	0
But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	0
And I'll tell you what.	0
I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.	0
But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.	0
There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.	0
When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	0
In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	0
There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	1
So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?	0
People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.	0
And it's a disgrace.	0
And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.	0
Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.	0
because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	0
Oh, really?	0
In the first debate...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And really, the audience needs to calm down here.	0
I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	0
I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	0
So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.	0
We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.	0
Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.	0
Because you'd be in jail.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.	0
Please do not applaud.	0
You're just wasting time.	0
And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails.	0
You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.	0
"You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless."""	0
The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.	0
You don't call that extremely careless?	0
Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.	0
Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.	0
I'm not making any excuses.	0
It was a mistake.	0
And I am very sorry about that.	0
But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.	0
After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.	0
I take classified materials very seriously and always have.	0
When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.	0
Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.	0
So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.	0
And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.	0
OK, we're going to move on.	0
And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	0
Right?	0
She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	0
You know, it's amazing.	0
I'm watching Hillary go over facts.	0
And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.	0
You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?	0
I don't think so.	0
She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.	0
Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.	0
33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	0
And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	0
That wasn't before.	0
That was after.	0
She got it from the United States Congress.	0
And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	0
Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.	0
But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.	0
What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	0
We have to move on.	0
You did that.	0
Wait a minute.	0
One second.	0
Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.	0
We want to give the audience a chance.	0
If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	0
Secretary Clinton, you can respond.	0
Then we have to move on to an audience question.	0
Look, it's just not true.	0
And so please, go to...	0
Oh, you didn't delete them?	0
Allow her to respond, please.	0
It was personal e-mails, not official.	0
Oh, 33,000?	0
Yeah.	0
Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	0
Oh, yeah.	0
What about the other 15,000?	0
Please allow her to respond.	0
She didn't talk while you talked.	0
Yes, that's true, I didn't.	0
Because you have nothing to say.	0
I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	0
Get off this question.	0
OK, Donald.	0
I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.	0
But let's at least focus...	0
Let's see what happens...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Allow her to respond.	0
on some of the issues that people care about tonight.	0
Let's get to their questions.	0
We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.	0
He has a question about health care.	0
Ken?	0
I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?	0
I'd like to know.	0
Why aren't you bringing...	0
We brought up the e-mails.	0
No, it hasn't.	0
It hasn't.	0
And it hasn't been finished at all.	0
Ken Karpowicz has a question.	0
It's nice to -- one on three.	0
Thank you.	0
Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable.	0
Premiums have gone up.	0
Deductibles have gone up.	0
Copays have gone up.	0
Prescriptions have gone up.	0
And the coverage has gone down.	0
What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?	0
That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.	0
If he wants to start, he can start.	0
No, go ahead, Donald.	0
No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	0
Go ahead.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	0
Premiums have gotten too high.	0
Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.	0
But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.	0
But that in and of itself was a good thing.	0
I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.	0
But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.	0
Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	0
Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.	0
Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	0
Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.	0
So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0
But we've got to get costs down.	0
We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	0
But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.	0
And then we would have to start all over again.	0
Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	1
That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	1
Secretary Clinton, your time is up.	0
So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.	0
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	0
Obamacare is a disaster.	0
You know it.	0
We all know it.	0
It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.	0
Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.	0
It's only getting worse.	0
In '17, it implodes by itself.	0
Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	0
We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	0
Obamacare will never work.	0
It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	0
Far too expensive.	0
And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	0
It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.	0
We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.	0
We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	0
We want competition.	0
You will have the finest health care plan there is.	0
She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.	1
And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.	0
It's catastrophic in certain ways.	0
But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.	0
Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.	0
Obamacare was the first step.	0
Obamacare is a total disaster.	0
And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.	0
Mr. Trump, your time...	0
It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.	0
Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you.	0
"Your husband called Obamacare, quote, ""the craziest thing in the world,"" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half."	0
Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?	0
No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	0
And it's very clear.	0
Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.	0
But we have an employer-based system.	0
That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	0
And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.	0
Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.	0
That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.	0
And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	0
So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...	0
Your time is up.	0
you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.	0
So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
That's not going to work.	0
Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this.	0
Well, I just want -- just one thing.	0
First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.	0
Everything.	0
Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.	0
This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.	0
You've said you want to end Obamacare...	0
By the way...	0
You've said you want to end Obamacare.	0
You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions.	0
How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?	0
We're going to be able to.	0
You're going to have plans...	0
What does that mean?	0
Well, I'll tell you what it means.	0
You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.	0
Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	0
Are you going -- are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?	0
President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	0
President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.	0
You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.	0
President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.	0
The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.	0
But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.	0
And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.	0
We're going to block grant into the states.	0
We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.	0
Hi.	0
There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them.	0
You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?	0
Mr. Trump, you're first.	0
Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.	0
But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	0
I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.	0
And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.	1
When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	0
As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.	1
Horribly wounded.	0
They'll never be the same.	0
Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	0
And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.	0
If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	0
Go outside.	0
Look at Paris.	0
Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	0
And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.	0
"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."""	0
Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.	0
She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	0
But the name is there.	0
It's radical Islamic terror.	0
And before you solve it, you have to say the name.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, thank you for asking your question.	0
And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.	0
And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	0
I want to say just a couple of things.	0
First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	0
And we've had many successful Muslims.	0
We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	0
My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.	0
That's what America is.	0
That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	0
It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.	0
We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.	0
I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.	0
I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.	0
It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	0
Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?	0
And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.	0
We are not at war with Islam.	0
And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	0
So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.	0
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
Mr. Trump, in December, you said this.	0
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.	0
We have no choice.	0
We have no choice.	0
Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position.	0
Is that correct?	0
And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?	0
First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	0
Iraq was disaster.	0
So he would have been alive today.	0
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.	0
Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.	0
Excuse me..	0
And why did it morph into that?	0
No, did you -- no, answer the question.	0
Do you still believe...	0
Why don't you interrupt her?	0
You interrupt me all the time.	0
I do.	0
Why don't you interrupt her?	0
Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?	0
It's called extreme vetting.	0
We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.	0
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	1
People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	1
This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.	0
We have enough problems in this country.	0
I believe in building safe zones.	0
I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.	0
But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.	0
We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.	0
And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.	0
We know you want tougher vetting.	0
That's not a perfect system.	0
So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?	0
Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	0
But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.	0
There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.	0
And we need to do our part.	0
We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.	0
But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	0
But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	0
How do you do that?	0
We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.	0
How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	0
Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	0
And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	0
So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.	0
And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.	1
And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	0
We have it on tape.	0
The entire press corps has looked at it.	0
It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	0
That's not been debunked.	0
So, please...	0
That has not been debunked.	0
go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.	0
I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.	1
Has not been debunked.	0
And you voted for it.	0
And you shouldn't have.	0
Well, I just want to say...	0
There's been lots of fact-checking on that.	0
I'd like to move on to an online question...	0
Excuse me.	0
She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	0
She did not.	0
Could I just respond to this, please?	0
Very quickly, please.	0
Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.	0
When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.	0
In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.	0
And they don't want them.	0
And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.	0
Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.	0
They're murderers and some very bad people.	0
And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.	0
We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.	1
At a record clip.	0
And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	0
ICE just endorsed me.	0
They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	0
The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	0
She doesn't.	0
She wants amnesty for everybody.	0
Come right in.	0
Come right over.	0
It's a horrible thing she's doing.	0
She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.	0
That I can tell you.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
I want to move on.	0
This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes.	0
This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues.	0
So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced?	0
Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues?	0
Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.	0
Well, right.	0
"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."""	0
It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.	0
It was principled, and it was strategic.	0
And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.	0
And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.	0
That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	0
But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.	0
And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	0
We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.	0
And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	0
They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.	0
Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.	0
But we deserve answers.	0
And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...	0
We're going to get to that later.	0
Secretary Clinton, you're out of time.	0
with the Russians and other foreign powers.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	0
Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.	0
Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	0
And she lied.	0
Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.	0
That's one that I haven't...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.	0
That's the good thing.	0
That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	0
That's a big, big difference.	0
We're talking about some difference.	0
But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.	1
I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	0
But I don't know Putin.	1
But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.	0
Maybe there is no hacking.	0
But they always blame Russia.	0
And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.	0
I know nothing about Russia.	0
I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.	0
I don't deal there.	0
I have no businesses there.	0
I have no loans from Russia.	0
I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.	0
One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.	0
But I have no loans with Russia.	0
You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.	0
Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	0
As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	0
Many of her friends took bigger deductions.	0
Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.	0
Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	0
Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.	0
I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	0
But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	0
I'll be very proud to.	0
They're actually quite great.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes.	0
We have a question from Spencer Maass.	0
Spencer?	0
Good evening.	0
My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?	0
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.	0
One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	0
And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	0
She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.	0
She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.	0
Well, why didn't she change it?	0
Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	0
The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.	0
And I do.	0
You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.	0
But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	0
But -- and I say that about a lot of things.	0
You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.	0
I wish you would have done this.	0
But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.	0
She never changed.	0
And she never will change.	0
She never will change.	0
We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	0
I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.	0
We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	0
But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	0
We're cutting taxes for the middle class.	0
And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.	0
And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	0
You can look at me.	0
She's raising your taxes really high.	0
And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.	0
But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.	0
That in itself is a big difference.	0
We are going to be thriving again.	0
We have no growth in this country.	0
There's no growth.	0
If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.	0
We're down at 1 percent.	0
And that's, like, no growth.	0
And we're going lower, in my opinion.	0
And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	1
And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	0
And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.	0
But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	0
Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	0
The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?	0
Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.	0
I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	0
And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.	0
But I'll tell you what he's going to do.	0
His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.	0
Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.	0
And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.	0
Now, here's what I want to do.	0
I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.	0
And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	0
And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	0
I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.	0
I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	0
It's called the Buffett rule.	0
Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.	0
I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	0
We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	0
I want to invest in hard-working families.	0
And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	0
And we need to reverse that.	0
People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.	0
Thank you.	0
I want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond.	0
I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to.	0
In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign.	0
The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.	0
They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.	0
You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.	0
You have not answered, though, a simple question.	0
Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?	0
Of course I do.	0
Of course I do.	0
And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	0
I know many of her donors.	0
Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	0
So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?	0
A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	0
And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.	0
That's why.	0
See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	0
Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.	0
But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.	0
Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.	0
But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.	0
I absolutely used it.	0
And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	0
Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.	0
So we won't make them famous.	0
So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?	0
No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.	0
But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.	0
I love depreciation.	0
You know, she's given it to us.	0
Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.	0
I say it all the time.	0
She talks about health care.	0
Why didn't she do something about it?	0
She talks about taxes.	0
Why didn't she do something about it?	0
She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	0
With her, it's all talk and no action.	0
In the past...	0
And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	0
She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.	0
She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	0
I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.	0
They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	0
Congratulations.	0
Great job.	0
Secretary -- I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.	0
Well, here we go again.	0
I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.	0
But that's not the point here.	0
Why didn't you do it?	0
Why didn't you do it?	0
Allow her to respond.	0
Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	0
Oh, really?	0
I will be the president and we will get it done.	0
That's exactly right.	0
You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
But you were not an effective senator.	0
Please allow her to respond.	0
She didn't interrupt you.	0
You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	0
"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that."""	0
So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.	0
I'm very glad to do so.	0
Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.	1
Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	0
After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.	0
Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	0
When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.	1
Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	0
I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	0
And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	0
Thank you, secretary.	0
I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.	0
Thank you, secretary.	0
We're going to move on to Syria.	0
Both of you have mentioned that.	0
She said a lot of things that were false.	0
I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	0
No, we can -- no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.	0
This is about the audience.	0
Excuse me.	0
Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	0
A disaster.	0
Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.	0
The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.	0
But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.	0
Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.	0
So this next question comes through social media through Facebook.	0
Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?	0
Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?	0
Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.	0
Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.	0
And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.	0
And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	0
Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.	0
They're interested in keeping Assad in power.	0
So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.	0
We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	0
And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	0
But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	0
Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.	0
And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.	0
I've stood up to Russia.	0
I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	0
I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.	0
And I did as secretary of state.	0
That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.	0
It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	0
So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	0
But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.	0
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...	1
No, I wasn't.	0
I was gone.	0
I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	0
OK.	0
But you were in contact -- excuse me.	0
You were...	0
At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.	0
You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	0
I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.	0
Obama draws the line in the sand.	0
It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	0
Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	0
But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.	1
Not good.	0
Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.	0
Russia is new in terms of nuclear.	0
We are old.	1
We're tired.	1
We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.	1
A very bad thing.	0
Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.	0
She talks in favor of the rebels.	0
She doesn't even know who the rebels are.	0
You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.	0
And you know what happens?	0
They end up being worse than the people.	0
Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	1
Gadhafi's out.	0
It's a mess.	0
And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.	1
I'm sure you probably have heard that.	0
It was a disaster.	0
Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.	0
But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.	0
We sign a peace treaty.	0
Everyone's all excited.	0
Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	1
But look at that deal.	0
Iran now and Russia are now against us.	0
So she wants to fight.	0
She wants to fight for rebels.	0
There's only one problem.	0
You don't even know who the rebels are.	0
So what's the purpose?	0
Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.	0
And one thing I have to say.	0
Your two minutes is up.	0
I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	0
Russia is killing ISIS.	0
And Iran is killing ISIS.	0
And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.	0
Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question.	0
If you were president...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?	0
And I want to remind you what your running mate said.	0
He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.	0
OK.	0
He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.	0
I disagree.	0
You disagree with your running mate?	0
I think you have to knock out ISIS.	0
Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	0
We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	0
But Syria is no longer Syria.	0
Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.	0
I believe we have to get ISIS.	0
We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	0
She had a chance to do something with Syria.	0
They had a chance.	0
And that was the line.	0
And she didn't.	0
What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?	0
I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.	0
What do you think will happen if it falls?	0
I think that it basically has fallen.	0
OK?	0
It basically has fallen.	0
Let me tell you something.	0
You take a look at Mosul.	0
The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	0
They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.	0
So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	0
Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.	0
Why can't they do it quietly?	0
Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?	0
People leave.	0
Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?	0
How stupid is our country?	0
There are sometimes reasons the military does that.	0
Psychological warfare.	0
I can't think of any.	0
I can't think of any.	0
And I'm pretty good at it.	0
It might be to help get civilians out.	0
And we have General Flynn.	0
And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	0
I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.	0
We talk about it all the time.	0
They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?	0
How -- why would these people stay there?	0
I've been reading now...	0
Tell me what your strategy is.	0
for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	0
Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.	0
They're gone.	0
Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.	0
Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.	0
All I say is this.	0
General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	0
I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.	0
Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go.	0
You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo.	0
You talk about diplomatic efforts.	0
Those have failed.	0
Cease-fires have failed.	0
Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?	0
I would not use American ground forces in Syria.	0
I think that would be a very serious mistake.	0
I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	0
I don't think that is a smart strategy.	0
I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	0
But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?	0
Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...	0
Everything.	0
I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.	0
I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.	0
And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.	0
No, he doesn't.	0
There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	0
And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.	0
I would go after Baghdadi.	0
I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.	0
So I think that could help.	0
I would also consider arming the Kurds.	0
The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	0
And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	0
Thank you very much.	0
We're going to move on...	0
You know what's funny?	0
She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.	0
When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	0
You had many answers.	0
It's really -- it's really very interesting.	0
We've got a question over here from James Carter.	0
Mr. Carter?	0
My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?	0
That question begins for Mr. Trump.	0
Absolutely.	0
I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.	0
I will be a president for all of our people.	0
And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.	0
Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.	0
Not in this country.	0
It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.	0
We lost our jobs.	0
We lost our money.	0
We lost our plants.	0
It is a disaster.	0
And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.	1
She called it the gold standard.	1
And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	0
They actually said that she lied.	0
OK?	0
And she lied.	0
But she's lied about a lot of things.	0
I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.	0
Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.	0
She's been talking about it for years.	0
As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.	0
She doesn't get it done.	0
Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.	0
The same exact thing.	0
They talk, they don't get it done.	0
You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	0
African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	0
The education is a disaster.	0
Jobs are essentially nonexistent.	0
I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?	0
It can't get any worse.	0
And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.	0
Nothing's going to ever happen.	0
Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.	0
It's just going to be talk.	0
And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.	0
She's not doing any me favors.	0
But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	0
Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
But I will tell you, she's all talk.	0
It doesn't get done.	0
All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.	0
Take a look at upstate New York.	0
Your two minutes is up.	0
Secretary Clinton, two minutes?	0
It turned out to be a disaster.	0
You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.	0
Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	0
Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.	0
You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.	0
And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.	0
I'm proud of that.	0
You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.	0
I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.	0
I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.	0
So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	0
And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.	0
They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.	0
She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.	0
He's 10 years old now.	0
This is the only one country he's ever known.	0
And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	0
You know, children listen to what is being said.	0
To go back to the very, very first question.	0
And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.	1
Bullying is up.	1
A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.	0
A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.	0
So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.	0
Your time, Secretary Clinton.	0
Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	0
If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	0
Your two minutes is up.	0
I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	0
Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up.	0
I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month.	0
"You said that half of Donald Trump's supporters are, quote, ""deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic."""	0
You later said you regretted saying half.	0
"You didn't express regret for using the term ""deplorables."""	0
To Mr. Carter's question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?	0
Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.	0
It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.	0
And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.	0
And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.	0
We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.	0
And he is supporting me 100 percent.	0
Thank you.	0
Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	0
We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
but we believed that we could make the country better.	0
And I was proud of that.	0
I want to give you a minute to respond.	0
We have a divided nation.	0
We have a very divided nation.	0
You look at Charlotte.	0
You look at Baltimore.	0
You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	0
We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.	1
We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	0
And when she said deplorables, she meant it.	0
And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.	0
She said some of them are irredeemable.	0
She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	0
And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	0
Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you.	0
In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline.	0
"You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, ""he or she won't be one for very long."""	0
In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.	0
Is that the discipline of a good leader?	0
No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.	1
It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	0
You mentioned sex tape.	0
By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	0
She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?	0
Guess what?	0
She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...	0
The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?	0
600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	0
Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	0
But she said she'll be awake.	0
Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	0
Guess what happened?	0
Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.	0
And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.	0
So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.	0
Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.	0
I mean, you can like it or not like it.	0
I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.	0
It's a very effective way of communication.	0
So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.	0
I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.	0
Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?	0
No.	0
I'm shocked to hear that.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Well, it's not only my opinion.	0
It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.	0
But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	0
Everybody.	0
African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	0
And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.	0
He stuck with me.	0
And I have worked and I admire President Obama.	0
He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	0
That was a terrible time for our country.	0
We have to move along.	0
Nine million people lost their jobs.	0
Secretary Clinton, we have to...	0
Five million homes were lost.	0
Secretary Clinton, we're moving.	0
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	0
We are back on the right track.	0
He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.	0
Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question.	0
We're almost out of time.	0
We have another...	0
We have the slowest growth since 1929.	0
We're moving to an audience question.	0
It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.	0
Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience.	0
Thank you very much both of you.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
We have another audience question.	0
Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.	0
Good evening.	0
Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.	0
What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?	0
We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.	0
Thank you.	0
Well, you're right.	0
This is one of the most important issues in this election.	0
I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.	0
Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	0
And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.	0
Donald doesn't agree with that.	0
I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.	0
I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	0
Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	0
And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.	0
I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	0
I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.	0
I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.	0
So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	0
And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.	0
I think that was a dereliction of duty.	0
I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	0
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
Thank you.	0
You're out of time.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.	0
And we have a vacancy.	0
I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.	0
I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	0
But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	0
And I think that this is so important.	0
Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.	1
They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	0
So important to me.	0
Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	0
So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.	0
What I ask is this.	0
So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.	0
Pretty much self-funding money.	0
We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.	0
I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.	0
She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	0
Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?	0
It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.	0
Why aren't you putting some money in?	0
You have a lot of it.	0
You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.	0
Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.	0
So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?	0
I'm just curious.	0
Well...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you very much.	0
We're going to get on to one more question.	0
The question was about the Supreme Court.	0
And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.	0
But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	0
Thank you.	0
We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.	0
We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	0
We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.	0
Ken?	0
What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?	0
Mr. Trump, two minutes?	0
Absolutely.	0
I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	0
Under absolutely siege.	0
The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.	0
And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.	0
We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.	0
Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.	0
But we need much more than wind and solar.	0
And you look at our miners.	0
Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	0
There is a thing called clean coal.	0
Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.	0
Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.	0
We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.	0
So good.	0
Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.	0
I will bring our energy companies back.	0
They'll be able to compete.	0
They'll make money.	0
They'll pay off our national debt.	0
They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.	0
But we are putting our energy companies out of business.	0
We have to bring back our workers.	0
You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.	0
We have to guard our energy companies.	0
We have to make it possible.	0
The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.	0
And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	0
It's a disgrace.	0
Your time is up.	0
Thank you.	0
It's an absolute disgrace.	0
Secretary Clinton, two minutes.	0
And actually -- well, that was very interesting.	0
First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	0
That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.	0
You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	0
We are not dependent upon the Middle East.	0
But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.	0
So the price of oil has been way down.	0
And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?	0
We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.	0
And I think that's an important transition.	0
We've got to remain energy-independent.	0
It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.	0
We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.	0
So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.	0
And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.	0
But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	0
That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.	0
A lot of them lost their lives.	0
They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.	0
I don't want to walk away from them.	0
So we've got to do something for them.	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
But the price of coal is down worldwide.	0
So we have to look at this comprehensively.	0
Your time is up.	0
And that's exactly what I have proposed.	0
I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.	0
Time is up.	0
We have time for one more...	0
We have...	0
One more audience question.	0
We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.	0
Good evening.	0
My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?	0
Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	0
Look, I respect his children.	0
His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	0
I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	0
And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	0
So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	0
This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.	0
We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	0
It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	0
And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.	0
And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	0
And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.	0
I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.	0
And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	0
So I consider that a compliment.	0
I will say this about Hillary.	0
She doesn't quit.	0
She doesn't give up.	0
I respect that.	0
I tell it like it is.	0
She's a fighter.	0
I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.	0
I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	0
But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	0
And I consider that to be a very good trait.	0
Thanks to both of you.	0
We want to thank both the candidates.	0
We want to thank the university here.	0
This concludes the town hall meeting.	0
Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.	0
Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.	0
Good night, everyone.	0
Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. President, world leaders and distinguished delegates, welcome to New York.	0
It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.	0
As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid.	0
The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.	0
Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.	0
The stock market is at an all-time high, a record.	0
Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before.	0
Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.	0
And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.	0
Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been.	0
For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements and religions have stood before this assembly.	0
Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today, but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.	0
We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity.	0
Breakthroughs in science, technology and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.	0
But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value.	0
Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet.	0
Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists, but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.	0
Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.	0
International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders.	0
And new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.	0
To put it simply, we meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril.	0
It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.	0
We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred and fear.	0
This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future.	0
It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security and promote their prosperity.	0
It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.	0
Those three beautiful pillars, they're pillars of peace: sovereignty, security and prosperity.	0
The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent and free.	0
As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations.	0
The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.	0
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.	0
Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty, to promote security, prosperity and peace for themselves and for the world.	0
We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions or even systems of government.	0
But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.	0
This is the beautiful vision of this institution.	0
And this is the foundation for cooperation and success.	0
Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.	0
Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny.	0
And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.	0
In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.	0
This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example.	0
We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution, the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.	1
This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity and freedom for the Americans, and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity and the rule of law.	0
The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three, beautiful words.	0
"They are ""We the people."""""	0
Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words	0
In America the people govern, the people rule and the people are sovereign.	0
I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people where it belongs.	0
In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.	0
Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens, to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights and to defend their values.	0
As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first.	0
All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.	0
But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.	0
The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.	0
But we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return.	0
As long as I hold this office, I will defend America's interest above all else.	0
But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it's in everyone's interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure.	0
America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations charter.	0
Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall.	0
America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe, to the deserts of the Middle East, to the jungles of Asia.	0
It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others.	0
Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security and prosperity for all.	0
For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope.	0
We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife.	0
We are guided by outcomes, not ideology.	0
We have a policy of principled realism rooted in shared goals, interests and values.	0
That realism forces us to confront the question facing every leader and nation in this room.	0
It is a question we cannot escape or avoid.	0
We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats and even wars that we face, or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?	0
If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent.	0
We must protect our nations, their interests and their futures.	0
We must reject threats to sovereignty from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.	0
We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow, and just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror.	0
The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based.	0
They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.	0
If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph when decent people and nations become bystanders to history.	0
The forces of destruction only gather power and strength.	0
No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.	0
It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans and for the imprisonment, torture, killing and oppression of countless more.	0
We were all witness to the regime's deadly abuse.	0
When an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later.	0
We saw it in the assassination of the dictator's brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport.	0
We know it kidnapped a sweet 13 year old, Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea's spies.	0
If this is not twisted enough now, North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.	0
It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would armed supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict.	0
No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals armed itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.	0
The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.	0
Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.	0
The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary.	0
That's what the United Nations is all about.	0
That's what the United Nations is for.	0
Let's see how they do.	0
It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.	0
The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-nothing votes, adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council.	0
Thank you to all involved, but we must do much more.	0
It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.	0
We face this decision, not only in North Korea.	0
It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime, one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel and ruin for many leaders and nations.	0
In this room, the Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy.	0
It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogues whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos.	0
The longest suffering victims of Iran's leaders are, in fact its own people, rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful, Arab and Israeli neighbors	0
This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran's people, also goes to shore up Basha al-Assad's dictatorship, fuel Yemeni Civil War and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.	0
We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.	1
The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into frankly that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don't think you've heard the last of it.	0
Believe me.	0
It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.	0
It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained and, above all, Iran's government must stop supporting terrorists begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.	0
The entire world understands that the good people of Iran won't change and other than the vast military power of the United States that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.	0
This is what causes the regime to restrict internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protesters and imprisoned political reformers.	0
Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the people will face a choice.	0
Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed and terror, or will the Iranian people return to the nation's proud roots as a center of civilization, culture and wealth, where their people can be happy and prosperous?	0
Once again, the Iranian regime support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its finance in Saudi Arabia.	0
Early last year I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.	0
We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamic extremism that inspires them.	0
We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation and indeed to tear up the entire world.	0
We must deny the terrorists, safe-haven, transit funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology	0
We must drive them out of our nations.	0
It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people, the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East.	0
To crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens, they use to launch attacks on all of our people.	0
Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.	0
From now on, our security interest will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.	0
I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq.	0
We have made big gains toward lasting defeat of Isis.	0
In fact, our country has achieved more against Isis in the last eight months than it has in many many years combined.	0
We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people the actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens.	0
Even innocent children shock the conscience of every decent person.	0
No society could be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread.	0
That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.	0
We appreciate the efforts of the United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.	0
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.	0
We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people and which enables their eventual return to their home countries.	0
To be part of the rebuilding process for the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.	0
Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the g20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible.	0
This is the safe responsible and humanitarian approach for decades.	0
The United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere.	0
We have learned that over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries for the sending countries.	0
It reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms for the receiving countries.	0
The substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens, whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.	0
I want to salute the work of the United Nations and seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.	0
The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa.	0
The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine, prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia and northern Nigeria and Yemen.	0
We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief, the president's malaria initiative, the global health security agenda, the Global Fund to end modern slavery and the woman entrepreneurs' finance initiative.	0
Part of our commitment to empowering women.	0
All across the globe, we also thank.	0
We also thank the Secretary-General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security and prosperity.	0
Too often, the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.	0
In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution's noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them.	0
For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments, with egregious human rights records, sit on the UN Human Rights Council.	0
The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.	1
In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes.	1
The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.	0
Major portions of the world are in conflict and some in fact are going to hell, but the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.	0
The American people hope that, one day soon, the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world.	0
In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share.	0
The burden militarily or financially, nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.	0
That is why, in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt destabilizing regime in Cuba and embrace the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom.	0
My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.	0
We have also imposed tough calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in venezuela, which has brought a once-thriving nation to the brink of total collapse	0
The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country.	0
This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere.	0
It has been tried to make matters worse.	0
Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.	0
The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing, their democratic institutions are being destroyed.	0
This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch as a responsible, neighbor and friend.	0
We and all others have a goal.	0
That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy.	0
I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.	0
The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.	0
We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.	0
We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.	0
Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.	0
I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis.	0
We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.	0
The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented from the Soviet Union to Cuba, to Venezuela wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted.	0
It has delivered anguish and devastation and failure.	0
Those who preach the tenants of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.	0
America stands with every person living under a brutal regime.	0
Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action.	0
All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests and their well-being, including their prosperity.	0
In America.	0
We seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of goodwill, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.	0
For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success.	0
But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factors disappeared, others gamed the system and broke the rules and our great middle class once the bedrock of American prosperity was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.	0
While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government, the duty of our citizens.	0
This bond is the source of America's strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.	0
If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the independent strength of its members.	0
If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations, nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies nations that seek allies to be friend, not enemies.	0
To conquer and most important of all nations that are home to patriots to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spirit.	0
In remembering the great victory that led to this body's founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved patriotism led the polls to die, to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France and the Brits to stand strong for Britain today if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.	0
We cannot wait for someone else for faraway countries or far-off bureaucracies.	0
We can't do it.	0
We must solve our problems to build our prosperity to secure our future or we will build vulnerable to decay domination and defeat.	0
The true question for the United Nations today for people all over the world who hope for better for themselves and their children is a basic one.	0
Are we still Patriots?	0
Do we love our nation's enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures?	0
Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?	0
One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was affected before the war commenced.	0
The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people.	0
That was the moment when America awoke when we looked around and understood that we were a nation, we realized who we were, what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend from its very first moments.	0
The American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.	0
The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, Security and Prosperity for all.	0
Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people and their patriotism.	0
History is asking us whether we are up to the task.	0
Our answer will be a renewal of will a rediscovery of resolve and a rebirth of devotion.	0
We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.	0
Our hope is a word and world of proud independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful earth.	0
This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.	0
So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world.	0
We will fight together, sacrifice together and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity and for the Almighty God who made us all.	0
Thank you.	0
God bless you.	0
God bless the nations of the world and god bless the United States of America.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Hello, midshipmen, hello.	0
Let me say to the entire brigade—please be at ease—enjoy yourselves, because we are all here to celebrate the amazing class of 2018.	0
Amazing job.	0
Thank you.	0
Really something.	0
Admiral Carter, thank you for that wonderful introduction and for your leadership, an incredible job you have done at this storied academy.	0
And thank you, Captain Chadwick, for your dedication and service.	0
Thank you to Undersecretary Modly, Admiral Richardson, General Walters, for joining us today.	0
Thanks also to Senator Wicker, Congressman Wittman, Congressman Valadao.	0
I want to recognize the entire brigade for a tremendous year.	0
This has been a spectacular year for you.	0
I have heard all about your achievements.	0
And a very special recognition for the midshipmen fourth class, you are plebs no more.	0
To all of the distinguished faculty and staff, to the local sponsor families, and most importantly, to the parents and grandparents and family members who have helped our graduates reached this joyous hour, today is your incredible achievement also.	0
They would have never made it without you, know this.	0
I want to thank the midshipmen and your families, and thank you.	0
America thanks you more than anybody.	0
You have done a spectacular job.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Finally, to the men and women about to be commissioned as ensigns in the Navy and second lieutenants in the Marine Corps, let me say on behalf of the entire nation, we could not be more proud of the United States Naval Academy Class of 2018.	0
Thank you.	0
Great job.	0
Congratulations to you all.	0
Four years ago, each of you made the most important decision of your lives.	0
You chose the path of hard work, sweat, and sacrifice.	0
You chose the life of honor, courage, and commitment.	0
You chose to serve the nation and defend our great American flag.	0
You chose the Navy, blue and gold, from the first moments of induction day.	0
Through a grueling six weeks of pleb summer, you endured and you persevered.	0
And then the rest of the brigade returned, and the real test began.	0
You developed morally, mentally, and physically.	0
You poured yourselves into military tactics, seamanship, navigation, ethics, and engineering.	0
And when hard work was not enough, like generations before you, you gathered your pennies and sought favor from the all-powerful Tecumseh.	0
All-powerful.	0
A little bit different.	0
Others worked hard for their demerits at McGarvey's and the Fleet Reserve Club.	0
And so today in keeping with tradition, I declare that all midshipmen on restriction for minor offenses, you are hereby absolved.	0
That sounds like a lot of people.	0
The Admiral will define exactly what that means, so Admiral, please go easy.	0
This is a great group of people here, Admiral.	0
I am told this class led Navy athletics to the highest win percentage in your 172-year history.	0
Think about that.	0
That includes taking the Army–Navy Star Series for the fourth straight year, a remarkable achievement in sport and athletics.	0
And because you care about every contest against Army, for the record, this year, Navy beat Army 19 times.	0
And I will not mention, I promised, who won the football game.	0
I will not mention it.	0
I refuse to say it.	0
But that is a great achievement.	0
And let me take a guess, you are still not tired of winning.	0
Winning is such a great feeling, isn't it?	0
Winning is such a great feeling.	0
Nothing like winning, you got to win.	0
In every endeavor, the class of 2018 has shown its metal and it's proved its might.	0
You have earned your place in the ancient league of sailors and shipmates, captains and commanders, warriors and mariners, and Marines.	0
You crave adventure.	0
Hello, folks, back there.	0
You chase discovery, and you never flinch in the eye of a raging storm.	0
America is in your heart.	0
The ocean is in your soul.	0
The saltwater runs through your veins.	0
You live your life according to the final law of the Navy.	0
The word impossible does not exist, because Navy never quits.	0
You don't give up.	0
You don't give in.	0
You don't back down.	0
And you never surrender.	0
Wherever you go, wherever you serve, wherever your mission takes you, you only have one word in mind, and that's victory.	0
That is why you are here.	0
Victory.	0
A very important word.	0
You are now leaders in the most powerful and righteous force on the face of the planet.	0
The United States military.	0
And we are respected again, I can tell you that.	0
We are respected again.	0
A lot of things have happened.	0
We are respected again.	0
For the last four years, you have walked the same paths as Navy's greatest legends, the giants of Midway and Coral Sea and Manila Bay.	0
Here in Annapolis, the glorious past is all around you, and so are the stories of your great heroes.	0
One such hero who appears in the pages of your old yearbooks is Bruce Voorhees.	0
Well-known all over.	0
Bruce hailed from Nevada and was a member of the Naval Academy class of 1929.	0
Beneath his picture in the 1929 Lucky Bag, Bruce's classmates wrote that he spent most of his time teaching the city slickers from the east the correct pronunciation of Nevada.	0
And I had to learn that, too, to win the state.	0
Great place.	0
He saw studying as an unnecessary evil, and they remembered in three cruises and four years in blue-serge brass buttons, he left a trail of broken hearts extending the full length of both coasts and radiating for miles around.	0
Crabtown.	0
In other words, he was just like you in many ways.	0
Just like you.	0
Not a lot of difference.	0
Just over a decade after his graduation, Lieutenant Commander Voorhees found himself at war.	0
Seventy-five years ago this summer, he was in the South Pacific commanding Bombing Squadron 102 during the battle of the Solomon Islands.	0
That was a rough battle.	0
His only brother had been killed and the Bataan Death March.	0
On July 6, Bruce volunteered for a mission to destroy a crucial enemy base.	0
It was a rough time.	0
It was a rough, tough situation.	0
He knew full-well that he would likely never return.	0
He knew he was going to die.	0
But he also knew his daring action could prevent a surprise attack on large-scale American forces.	0
So, his plane took off alone on a 700-mile flight.	0
Bruce flew through the darkness to his target, a tiny speck on the vast open sea.	0
He braved unrelenting anti-aircraft fire, like nobody had ever seen at that time, and a trail of enemy planes to single-handedly destroy this large enemy base, including multiple fortifications, and a critical communications link.	0
And in this final act of valor, Bruce was caught in the blast of one of his own bombs and perished in a remote lagoon very far from here.	0
His life was lost, but his legacy will live forever.	0
Many of you have seen his old room at Bancroft Hall, commemorating his Congressional Medal of Honor, our highest honor.	0
Some here today will trace his path to Pensacola to earn your wings.	0
You may even make it all the way out to the legendary combat-training school known as Top Gun in bruce's beloved hometown in Nevada.	0
There, you will have the honor to take flight from the Voorhees Field, and remember a hero who fought for his country, and died for his homeland, and saved so many lives with his bravery.	0
Each of you inherits the legacy of the heroes who came before you.	0
It's a living history passed down from officer to officer and generation to generation.	0
Each of you will make your own mark on the Navy, the Marine Corps, the military, and the history of our great nation.	0
Seize today and you will shape tomorrow.	0
In a few moments, you will be commissioned into the mightiest fighting forces of the air, the land, and the sea.	0
Together, you will blast off carriers of which we are just now finishing, the largest aircraft carrier in the world, and launch off submarines of which we have many under construction, and ward off evil.	0
You will bring comfort to our friends and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.	0
Among our graduates today will be 283 naval aviators, 134 submariners, 256 surface-warfare officers, 70 restricted-line officers, and 15 explosive-ordnance-disposal officers.	0
Two-hundred-and-thirty-six United States Marines, and 35 very tough, very well conditioned Navy SEALs.	0
Together, you are the tip of the spear, the edge of the blade, and the front of the shield defending and protecting our great country.	0
You know, there is no mission our pilots can't handle.	0
There is no hill our Marines can't take, and there is no stronghold the SEALs can't reach.	0
There is no sea the Navy can't brave, and there is no storm the American sailor can't conquer.	0
Because you know that together, there is nothing Americans can't do.	0
Absolutely nothing.	0
In recent years and even decades, too many people have forgotten that truth.	0
They have forgotten that our ancestors trounced an empire, tamed a continent, and triumphed over the worst evils in history.	0
In every generation, there have been cynics and critics that try to tear down America.	0
But in recent years, the problem grew worse.	0
A growing number used their platforms to denigrate America's incredible heritage, challenge America's sovereignty, and weaken America's pride.	0
We know the truth, will speak the truth, and defend that truth.	0
America is the greatest fighting force for peace, justice, and freedom in the history of the world.	0
And in case you have not noticed, we have become a lot stronger lately.	0
A lot.	0
We are not going to apologize for America.	0
We are going to stand up for America.	0
No more apologies.	0
We are going to stand up for our citizens.	0
We are going to stand up for our values.	0
And we are going to stand up for our men and women in uniform.	0
Because we know that a nation must have pride in its history to have confidence in its future.	0
We are the nation that built the highways, the railroads, the Empire State Building in one year, the Golden Gate Bridge, and we are the nation that built the Panama Canal.	0
We trekked the mountains, explored the oceans, and settled the vast frontier.	0
We won two world wars, defeated communism and fascism, and put a man on the face of the moon.	0
We cured disease, pioneered science, and produced timeless works of art that inspire the human soul.	0
And on distant islands, far-away battlefields, above the skies and beneath the sea, the entire world has borne witness to the unstoppable strength, skill, and courage of the United States Navy and the American Marines.	0
Each of you enters service at a truly exciting time for our country.	0
For we are witnessing the great reawakening of the American spirit and of American might.	0
We have rediscovered our identity, regained our stride, and we are proud again.	0
Prosperity is booming at home.	0
Our economy is the strongest it has ever been.	0
And our country has regained the respect that we used to have long ago abroad.	0
Yes, they are respecting us again.	0
Yes, America is back.	0
We have begun the great rebuilding of the United States military.	0
We have ended the disastrous defense sequester.	0
No money for the military?	0
Those days are over.	0
And we have just secured, you have read all about it, a $700 billion, largest-ever amount of money to support our great war fighters.	0
And I might add that next year—the $700 billion, not million.	0
They're liking the sound of million, but billion is better—the $700 billion goes to $716 billion, and we are going to be stronger than ever before.	0
We will have the strongest military that we have ever had, and it won't even be close.	0
And when did we need it more than now?	0
That means new ships.	0
You like that.	0
We have now the lowest number of ships we have had since World War I.	0
And very soon, we are going to get to 355 beautiful ships.	0
That is almost a couple of hundred more ships.	0
So you will be around for a long time.	0
We are not running out of equipment.	0
We're not running out of ships.	0
And that has been approved.	0
And we are honored by it.	0
You are going to have new equipment, and well-deserved pay raises.	0
We just got to a big pay raise for the first time in 10 years.	0
We got to a big pay increase, first time in over 10 years.	1
I fought for you.	0
That was the hardest one to get.	0
But you never had a chance of losing.	0
I represented you well.	0
I represented you well.	0
And this week, we passed new landmark legislation to give more choice and better care to our great veterans.	0
We are going to take care of our veterans.	0
We are doing a great job with it.	0
We are taking care, finally, after decades, we are taking care of our veterans.	0
We passed VA accountability.	0
Everybody said it could not be done.	0
If you didn't do a good job, you could not get fired.	0
"Now, you don't do a good job and take care of our veterans, they will look you in the eye and they say, ""Jim"	0
"We will say, ""Get him out of here"	0
We are reestablishing the second fleet in the Atlantic: bigger, better, stronger than it has ever been before.	0
We are rebuilding our defense industrial base to forge American iron, aluminum, and steel, which, by the way, we just put tariffs on when it comes in from other countries.	0
Okay?	0
We are taking in a lot of money now, our country.	0
They pay that big, beautiful tariff and it goes right into building new ships.	0
We have been taken advantage of by the world.	0
That is not going to be happening anymore.	0
You see what is going on.	0
So, we are building a modern fleet manned by the greatest sailors.	0
We're sharpening the fighting edge from Marines infantry squads to combat ships to deliver maximum, lethal force.	0
The enemy has to know we have that.	0
We are recommitting to this fundamental truth: We are a maritime nation.	0
Being a maritime nation, we are surrounded by sea.	0
We must always dominate that sea.	0
We will always dominate the oceans.	0
We are showing what we can achieve when natural American confidence is backed by unrivaled American power and unquestioned American resolve.	0
Also, there is another word that's never used, and I will use it today.	0
It's called talent.	0
We have talent and a lot of other people don't, and a lot of other countries don't.	0
We have great talent and I have seen it.	0
In other words, we are showing what is possible when America starts acting like its sailors and Marines.	0
Our nation cannot be strong without the heroes whose hearts stir the words: Don't give up the ship.	0
Famous phrase.	0
We even use it in business.	0
"Things are going bad, you say, ""Don't give up the ship."""""	0
Keep fighting.	0
Don't give up the ship.	0
But it's really—you guys started it.	0
Our country cannot prevail without those who rally to the famous cry	0
You hail from every background and you come from every walk of life.	0
But each of you is formed by the same defining choice, to answer the call.	0
You all share the same heart, the same blood, and swear by the same motto: Not for self but country.	0
It's a great motto.	0
With us today are living symbols of that long and unbroken chain of American patriots, members of the Naval Academy class of 1968.	0
That's great.	0
Stand up, please.	0
Exactly 50 years ago, they were in your shoes.	0
They embarked into service and they made America very proud.	0
To everyone in the class of 1968, we thank you and we salute you.	0
Like those who came before them, today's graduates will serve America through times of triumph and some hours of peril.	0
There will be hours of peril.	0
You will face new challenges, even challenges that you can't envision, but you'll find new solutions that nobody can even imagine.	0
Among your ranks is the next Chester Nimitz, the next Grace Hopper, the next John Lejeune.	0
Future generations will talk about you.	0
They will tell your stories, speak of your courage, and someone many years from now will be standing right here, in my position, paying tribute to your great service.	0
It will happen.	0
Because you already know the keys to success.	0
You know that as long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, we will not fail.	0
We will not fail.	0
We cannot fail.	0
We will always succeed, always.	0
As long as we are united with the same mission, the same purpose, the same patriotic heart, we will win, because we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.	0
Together we struggle.	0
Together we strive.	0
Together we pray.	0
And together we triumph as citizens, as patriots, as Americans.	0
We stand on the shoulders of heroes who gave their sweat, their blood, their tears, and their very lives for this great country of ours.	0
This is our heritage.	0
This is our home.	0
And this is our pledge.	0
We are all in for America, like never before.	0
We are all in for our great country.	0
So to the Naval Academy of the class of 2018, I say a number of things.	0
Number one, I say that I was given an option.	0
I could make this commencement address, which is a great honor for me, and immediately leave and wave goodbye, or I could stay and shake hands with just the top 100, or I could stay for hours and shake hands with 1,100 and something.	0
What should I do?	0
What should I do?	0
I'll stay.	0
I'll stay.	0
I will stay.	0
But to the class of 2018, I do say strive for excellence.	0
Live for adventure.	0
Think big.	0
Dream bigger.	0
Push further.	0
Sail faster.	0
Fly higher.	0
And never, ever stop reaching for greatness.	0
Never stop reaching for the stars.	0
You know you're up to the task.	0
You're among the finest people anywhere in the world, the smartest, the strongest.	0
You know you will make us proud.	0
We know that glory will be yours because you are winners.	0
You are warriors.	0
You are fighters.	0
You are champions, and you will lead us only to victory.	0
Good luck.	0
May god be with you.	0
God bless America, and anchors away.	0
I'm Anderson Cooper.	0
Thanks for joining us.	0
We've already welcomed the candidates on stage.	0
They are in place at their podiums.	0
Before we dive into the issues, I want to quickly explain some of the groundrules tonight.	0
As the moderator, I'll ask questions, followups and guide the discussion.	0
I'll be joined in the questioning by CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash, a well as Don Lemon who will share questions from Democrats around the country.	0
Each candidate will get one minute to answer questions, and 30 seconds for followups and rebuttals.	0
I'll give candidates time to respond if they have been singled out for criticism.	0
Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up.	0
I want the candidates to be able to introduce themselves to our audience.	0
Each candidate will have two minutes to introduce themselves.	0
Let's begin with Governor Chafee.	0
Governor?	0
Thank you, Anderson.	0
Thank you, CNN, and thank you Facebook for organizing this debate.	0
Not only will Americans be electing a new president next year, we also will be electing a world leader.	0
Voters should assess the candidate's experience, character and vision for the future as they make this important decision.	0
I'm the only one running for president that has been a mayor, a United States senator, and a governor.	0
As mayor, I brought labor peace to my city and kept taxes down.	0
I was reelected three times.	0
As a senator, I earned a reputation for courageous votes against the Bush-Cheney tax cuts the favored the wealthy, against the tragedy of the Iraq war, for environmental stewardship, for protection of our civil liberties.	0
I served on the Foreign Relations Committee and I chaired the Middle East Subcommittee for four years.	0
As governor, I came in at the depths of the recession and we turned my state around.	0
Rhode Island had the biggest drop of the unemployment rate over my four budgets of all but one state.	0
It happens to be Nevada, where we're having this debate.	0
I'm very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals.	0
I've always been honest.	0
I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I've shown good judgment.	0
I have high ethical standards.	0
As we look to the future, I want to address the income inequality, close the gap between the haves and the have-nots.	0
I want to address climate change, a real threat to our planet.	0
And I believe in prosperity through peace.	0
I want to end these wars.	0
I look forward to the discussion ahead.	0
Thank you	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you very much, Governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Webb, you have two minutes.	0
Thank you.	0
You know, people are disgusted with the way that money has corrupted our political process, intimidating incumbents and empowering Wall Street every day, the turnstile government that we see, and also the power of the financial sector in both parties.	0
They're looking for a leader who understands how the system works, who has not been coopted by it, and also has a proven record of accomplishing different things.	0
I have a record of working across the political aisle.	0
I've also spent more than half of my professional life away from politics in the independent world of being an author, a journalist, and a sole proprietor.	0
In government service, I've fought and bled for our country in Vietnam as a Marine.	0
I spent years as Assistant Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy — in the Reagan administration.	0
In the senate, I spoke about economic fairness and social justice from day one.	0
I also wrote and passed the best piece of veterans education legislation in history, the Post 9/11 G.I.	0
Bill.	0
I brought criminal justice reform out of the political shadows and into the national discussion.	0
I led what later became called the Strategic Pivot to Asia two years before President Obama was elected.	0
I know where my loyalties are.	0
My mother grew up in the poverty of east Arkansas chopping cotton, picking strawberries.	0
Three of her seven siblings died in childhood.	0
My wife, Hong, came to this country as a refugee from war torn Vietnam — learned English, a language that was not spoken at home, and earned her way into Cornell Law School.	0
I have five daughters.	0
Amy works with disabled veterans, Sarah is an emergency room nurse, Julia is a massage therapist, Emily and Georgia are still in school.	0
My son Jim fought as an infantry Marine on the bloody streets of Ramadi.	0
You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common sense foreign policy.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Governor O'Malley, you have two minutes.	0
My name is Martin O'Malley, former Mayor of Baltimore, former governor of Maryland, a life long democrat, and most importantly, a husband, and a father.	0
My wife Katie and I have four great kids, Grace, and Tara, and William and Jack.	0
And, like you, there is nothing we wouldn't do to give them healthier and better lives.	0
There are some things that I have learned to do better in life than others.	0
And, after 15 years of executive experience, I have learned how to be an effective leader.	0
Whether it was raising the minimum wage, making our public schools the best in America, passing marriage equality, the DREAM Act, and comprehensive gun safety legislation, I have learned how to get things done because I am very clear about my principals.	0
Thanks to President Obama, our country has come a long way since the Wall Street crash of 2008.	0
Our country's doing better, we are creating jobs again.	0
But we elected a president, not a magician, and there is urgent work that needs to be done right now.	0
For there is a — deep injustice, an economic injustice that threatens to tear our country apart, and it will not solve itself.	0
Injustice does not solve itself.	0
What I'm talking about is this, our middle class is shrinking.	0
Our poor families are becoming poorer, and 70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago.	0
We need new leadership, and we need action.	0
The sort of action that will actually make wages go up again for all American families.	0
Our economy isn't money, it's people.	0
It's all of our people, and so we must invest in our country, and the potential of our kids to make college a debt free option for all of our families, instead of settling our kids with a lifetime of crushing debt.	0
And, we must square our shoulders to the great challenge of climate change and make this threat our opportunity.	0
The future is what we make of it.	0
We are all in this together.	0
And, the question in this election is whether you and I still have the ability to give our kids a better future.	0
I believe we do, that is why I am running for president, and I need your help.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
Anderson, thank you very much.	0
I think most Americans understand that our country today faces a series of unprecedented crises.	0
The middle class of this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing.	0
Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, and yet almost all of the new income and wealth being created is going to the top one percent.	0
As a result of this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining American democracy.	0
Millionaires and billionaires are pouring unbelievable sums of money into the political process in order to fund super PACs and to elect candidates who represent their interests, not the interests of working people.	0
Today, the scientific community is virtually unanimous: climate change is real, it is caused by human activity, and we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren.	0
Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.	1
African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent.	1
Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent.	1
It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe — just maybe — we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids.	0
[ applause ]	0
What this campaign is about is whether we can mobilize our people to take back our government from a handful of billionaires and create the vibrant democracy we know we can and should have.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, thank you, and thanks to everyone for hosting this first of the Democratic debates.	0
I'm Hillary Clinton.	0
I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state.	0
I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child.	0
And every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children.	0
I have spent a very long time — my entire adult life — looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential.	0
I've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and I've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy.	0
At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages.	0
Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them.	0
And then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one.	0
Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much.	0
So I have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families.	0
And I want to do more to help us balance family and work.	0
I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world.	0
[ applause ]	0
During the course of the evening tonight, I'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I've done behind them.	0
But for me, this is about bringing our country together again.	0
And I will do everything I can to heal the divides — the divides economically, because there's too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community — so that we work together and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, all.	0
It is time to start the debate.	0
Are you all ready?	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Let's begin.	0
We're going to be discussing a lot of the issues, many of the issues, important issues that you have brought up.	0
But I want to begin with concerns that voters have about each of the candidates here on this stage that they have about each of you.	0
Secretary Clinton, I want to start with you.	0
Plenty of politicians evolve on issues, but even some Democrats believe you change your positions based on political expediency.	0
You were against same-sex marriage.	0
Now you're for it.	0
You defended President Obama's immigration policies.	0
Now you say they're too harsh.	0
You supported his trade deal dozen of times.	0
"You even called it the ""gold standard""."	0
Now, suddenly, last week, you're against it.	0
Will you say anything to get elected?	0
Well, actually, I have been very consistent.	0
Over the course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and principles, but, like most human beings — including those of us who run for office — I do absorb new information.	0
I do look at what's happening in the world.	0
You know, take the trade deal.	0
I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard.	1
It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards.	0
My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans.	0
"And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ""this will help raise your wages."""	0
And I concluded I could not.	0
Secretary Clinton, though, with all due respect, the question is really about political expediency.	0
"Just in July, New Hampshire, you told the crowd you'd, quote, ""take a back seat to no one when it comes to progressive values."""	0
"Last month in Ohio, you said you plead guilty to, quote, ""being kind of moderate and center."""	0
Do you change your political identity based on who you're talking to?	0
No.	0
I think that, like most people that I know, I have a range of views, but they are rooted in my values and my experience.	0
And I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment.	0
You know, when I left law school, my first job was with the Children's Defense Fund, and for all the years since, I have been focused on how we're going to un-stack the deck, and how we're gonna make it possible for more people to have the experience I had.	0
You know, to be able to come from a grandfather who was a factory worker, a father who was a small business person, and now asking the people of America to elect me president.	0
Just for the record, are you a progressive, or are you a moderate?	0
I'm a progressive.	0
But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.	0
And I know...	0
[ applause ]	0
...how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly.	0
But we found ways to work together on everything from...	0
Secretary...	0
...reforming foster care and adoption to the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insures...	0
...thank you...	0
...8 million kids.	0
So I have a long history of getting things done, rooted in the same values...	0
...Senator...	0
...I've always had.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
A Gallup poll says half the country would not put a socialist in the White House.	0
You call yourself a democratic socialist.	0
How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?	0
Well, we're gonna win because first, we're gonna explain what democratic socialism is.	0
And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent — almost — own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.	0
That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.	0
That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right, except the United States.	0
You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have — we are gonna have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth.	1
Those are some of the principles that I believe in, and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.	0
[ applause ]	0
Denmark is a country that has a population — Denmark is a country that has a population of 5.6 million people.	0
The question is really about electability here, and that's what I'm trying to get at.	0
You — the — the Republican attack ad against you in a general election — it writes itself.	0
You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.	0
You honeymooned in the Soviet Union.	0
And just this weekend, you said you're not a capitalist.	0
Doesn't — doesn't that ad write itself?	0
Well, first of all, let's look at the facts.	0
The facts that are very simple.	0
Republicans win when there is a low voter turnout, and that is what happened last November.	0
Sixty-three percent of the American people didn't vote, Anderson.	0
Eighty percent of young people didn't vote.	0
We are bringing out huge turnouts, and creating excitement all over this country.	0
Democrats at the White House on down will win, when there is excitement and a large voter turnout, and that is what this campaign is doing.	0
You don't consider yourself a capitalist, though?	0
Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy?	0
No, I don't.	0
I believe in a society where all people do well.	0
Not just a handful of billionaires.	0
[ applause ]	0
Just let me just be clear.	0
Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist?	0
Well, let me just follow-up on that, Anderson, because when I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families.	0
And I don't think we should confuse what we have to do every so often in America, which is save capitalism from itself.	0
And I think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have.	0
But we are not Denmark.	0
I love Denmark.	0
We are the United States of America.	0
And it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system.	0
But we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history...	0
Senator Sanders?	0
... of the world.	0
[ applause ]	0
I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation.	0
We have got to encourage that.	0
Of course, we have to support small and medium-sized businesses.	0
But you can have all of the growth that you want and it doesn't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.	0
So what we need to do is support small and medium-sized businesses, the backbone of our economy, but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake...	0
We're going to get...	0
... not just for billionaires.	0
We're going to have a lot more on these issues.	0
But I do want to just quickly get everybody in on the question of electability.	0
Governor Chafee, you've been everything but a socialist.	0
When you were senator from Rhode Island, you were a Republican.	0
When you were elected governor, you were an independent.	0
You've only been a Democrat for little more than two years.	0
Why should Democratic voters trust you won't change again?	0
Anderson, you're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues.	0
Whether it's...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
It seems like pretty soft granite.	0
I mean, you've been a Republican, you've been an independent.	0
Did you hear what I said?	0
On the issues.	0
I have not changed on the issues.	0
I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I'm a proud Democrat.	0
But I have not changed on the issues.	0
And I open my record to scrutiny.	0
Whether it's on the environment, a woman's right to choose, gay marriage, fiscal responsibility, aversion to foreign entanglements, using the tools of government to help the less fortunate.	0
Time and time again, I have never changed.	0
You're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues.	0
So I have not changed.	0
Then why change labels?	0
The party left me.	0
There's no doubt about that.	0
There was no room for a liberal moderate Republican in that party.	0
I even had a primary for my reelection in 2006.	0
I won it.	0
But the money poured in to defeat me in Rhode Island as a Republican.	0
That's what we were up against.	0
Governor O'Malley, the concern of voters about you is that you tout our record as Baltimore's mayor.	0
As we all know, we all saw it.	0
That city exploded in riots and violence in April.	0
The current top prosecutor in Baltimore, also a Democrat, blames your zero tolerance policies for sowing the seeds of unrest.	0
Why should Americans trust you with the country when they see what's going on in the city that you ran for more than seven years?	0
Yes, actually, I believe what she said was that there's a lot of policies that have led to this unrest.	0
But, Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore in 1999...	0
She actually — just for the record, when she was asked which policies, to name two, she said zero tolerance.	0
I mean, there's a number of old policies that we're seeing the results of.	0
That distress of communities, where communities don't want to step forward and say who killed a 3-year-old, it's a direct result of these failed policies.	0
Well, let's talk about this a little bit.	0
One of the things that was not reported during that heartbreaking night of unrest in Baltimore was that arrests had actually fallen to a 38-year low in the year prior to the Freddie Gray's tragic death.	0
Anderson, when I ran for mayor of Baltimore back in 1999, it was not because our city was doing well.	0
It was because we allowed ourselves to become the most violent, addicted, and abandoned city in America.	0
And I ran and promised people that together we could turn that around.	0
And we put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, or part one (ph) crime by more than any other major city in America over the next 10 years.	0
I did not make our city immune to setbacks.	0
But I attended a lot of funerals, including one for a family of seven who were firebombed in their sleep for picking up the phone in a poor African-American neighborhood and calling the police because of drug dealers on their corner.	0
We've saved over a thousand lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years of people working together.	0
And the vast majority of them were young and poor and black.	0
It wasn't easy on any day.	0
But we saved lives and we gave our city a better future, improving police and community relations every single day that I was in office.	0
In one year alone, though, 100,000 arrests were made in your city, a city of 640,000 people.	0
The ACLU, the NAACP sued you, sued the city, and the city actually settled, saying a lot of those arrests were without probable cause.	0
"Well, I think the key word in your followup there was the word ""settle."""	0
That's true.	0
It was settled.	0
Arrests peaked in 2003, Anderson, but they declined every year after that as we restored peace in our poorer neighborhoods so that people could actually walk and not have to worry about their kids or their loved ones of being victims of violent crime.	0
Look, none of this is easy.	0
None of us has all the answers.	0
But together as a city, we saved a lot of lives.	0
It was about leadership.	0
It was about principle.	0
And it was about bringing people together.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Thank you.	0
"Senator Webb, in 2006, you called affirmative action ""state-sponsored racism."""	0
In 2010, you wrote an op/ed saying it discriminates against whites.	0
Given that nearly half the Democratic Party is non-white, aren't you out of step with where the Democratic Party is now?	0
No, actually I believe that I am where the Democratic Party traditionally has been.	0
The Democratic Party, and the reason I've decided to run as a Democrat, has been the party that gives people who otherwise have no voice in the corridors of power a voice.	0
And that is not determined by race.	0
And as a clarification, I have always supported affirmative action for African Americans.	0
That's the way the program was originally designed because of their unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed.	0
"What I have discussed a number of times is the idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone, quote, ""of color,"" other than whites, struggling whites like the families in the Appalachian mountains, we're not being true to the Democratic Party principle of elevating the level of consciousness among our people about the hardships that a lot of people who happen to be have — by culture, by the way."	0
Senator Webb, thank you very much.	0
Let's move on to some of the most pressing issues facing our country right now, some of the biggest issues right now in the headlines today.	0
We're going to start with guns.	0
The shooting in Oregon earlier this month, once again it brought the issue of guns into the national conversation.	0
Over the last week, guns have been the most discussed political topic on Facebook by two to one.	0
Senator Sanders, you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period.	1
You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains.	0
For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea.	0
Now, you say you're reconsidering that.	0
Which is it: shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not?	0
Let's begin, Anderson, by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D-minus voting rating (ph) from the NRA.	0
Let's also understand that back in 1988 when I first ran for the United States Congress, way back then, I told the gun owners of the state of Vermont and I told the people of the state of Vermont, a state which has virtually no gun control, that I supported a ban on assault weapons.	0
And over the years, I have strongly avoided instant background checks, doing away with this terrible gun show loophole.	0
And I think we've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers.	0
Also I believe, and I've fought for, to understand that there are thousands of people in this country today who are suicidal, who are homicidal, but can't get the healthcare that they need, the mental healthcare, because they don't have insurance or they're too poor.	0
I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately.	0
Do you want to shield gun companies from lawsuits?	0
Of course not.	0
This was a large and complicated bill.	0
There were provisions in it that I think made sense.	0
For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible?	0
I don't.	0
On the other hand, where you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that, of course we should take action.	0
Secretary Clinton, is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns?	0
No, not at all.	0
I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence.	0
This has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA.	0
The majority of our country...	0
[ applause ]	0
... supports background checks, and even the majority of gun owners do.	0
Senator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady bill.	0
Since it was passed, more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented.	0
He also did vote, as he said, for this immunity provision.	0
I voted against it.	0
I was in the Senate at the same time.	0
It wasn't that complicated to me.	0
It was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in America.	0
Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers.	0
And we need to stand up and say: Enough of that.	0
We're not going to let it continue.	0
[ applause ]	0
We're going to bring you all in on this.	0
But, Senator Sanders, you have to give a response.	0
As a senator from a rural state, what I can tell Secretary Clinton, that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing.	0
I believe that there is a consensus in this country.	0
A consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with this gun show loophole, that we have to address the issue of mental health, that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue, and that when we develop that consensus, we can finally, finally do something to address this issue.	0
Governor O'Malley, you passed gun legislation as governor of Maryland, but you had a Democratic-controlled legislature.	0
President Obama couldn't convince Congress to pass gun legislation after the massacres in Aurora, in Newtown, and Charleston.	0
How can you?	0
And, Anderson, I also had to overcome a lot of opposition in the leadership of my own party to get this done.	0
Look, it's fine to talk about all of these things — and I'm glad we're talking about these things — but I've actually done them.	0
We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said.	0
We actually did it.	0
And, Anderson, here tonight in our audience are two people that make this issue very, very real.	0
Sandy and Lonnie Phillips are here from Colorado.	0
And their daughter, Jessie, was one of those who lost their lives in that awful mass shooting in Aurora.	0
Now, to try to transform their grief, they went to court, where sometimes progress does happen when you file in court, but in this case, you want to talk about a — a rigged game, Senator?	0
The game was rigged.	0
A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this — this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask where it was going.	0
And not only did their case get thrown out of court, they were slapped with $200,000 in court fees because of the way that the NRA gets its way in our Congress and we take a backseat.	0
It's time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond, 30 seconds.	0
I think the governor gave a very good example about the weaknesses in that law and I think we have to take another look at it.	0
But here is the point, Governor.	0
We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not.	0
Our job is to bring people together around strong, commonsense gun legislation.	0
I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing, and I intend to lead the country in bringing our people together.	0
Senator — Senator, excuse me.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator, it is not about rural — Senator, it was not about rural and urban.	0
It's exactly about rural.	0
Have you ever been to the Eastern Shore?	0
Have you ever been to Western Maryland?	0
We were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas.	0
Governor...	0
And we did it by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA and backing down to the NRA.	0
Well, as somebody who has a D-minus voting record...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
And I have an F from the NRA, Senator.	0
I don't think I am pandering.	0
But you have not been in the United States Congress.	0
Well, maybe that's a healthy thing.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And when you want to, check it out.	0
And if you think — if you think that we can simply go forward and pass something tomorrow without bringing people together, you are sorely mistaken.	0
Let me bring in somebody who has a different viewpoint.	0
Senator Webb, your rating from the NRA, you once had an A rating from the NRA.	0
You've said gun violence goes down when more people are allowed to carry guns.	0
Would encouraging more people to be armed be part of your response to a mass shooting?	0
Look, there are two fundamental issues that are involved in this discussion.	0
We need to pay respect to both of them.	0
The first is the issue of who should be kept from having guns and using firearms.	0
And we have done not a good job on that.	0
A lot of them are criminals.	0
And a lot of the people are getting killed are members of gangs inside our urban areas.	0
And a lot of them are mentally incapacitated.	0
And the shooting in Virginia Tech in '07, this individual had received medical care for mental illness from three different professionals who were not allowed to share the information.	0
So we do need background checks.	0
We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them.	0
But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.	0
Senator...	0
May I?	0
People are going back and forth here for 10 minutes here.	0
There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day, seven days a week.	0
The average American does not have that, and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.	0
Senator — Governor Chafee, you have an F rating from the NRA, what do you think about what Senator Webb just said?	0
Yes, I have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation, but the reality is, despite these tragedies that happen time and time again, when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation, the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns.	0
And, they're successful at it, in Colorado and others states, the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated.	0
I even saw in Rhode Island.	0
So, I would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this.	0
Where can we find common ground?	0
Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders.	0
Come one, we've go to change this.	0
We're not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the Second Amendment, but let's find common ground here.	0
I want to...	0
...Anderson, when the NRA wrote to everyone in our state — when the NRA wrote to members in our state and told people with hunting traditions lies about what our comprehensive gun safety legislation is, I wrote right back to them and laid out what it actually did.	0
And that's why, not only did we pass it, but the NRA didn't...	0
...Excuse me...	0
...dare to petition a referendum...	0
...I want to make...	0
...Because we built a public consensus...	0
...I want to move on to another issue, which is in the headlines right now, another crisis making headlines.	0
Secretary Clinton, Russia, they're challenging the U.S. in Syria.	0
According to U.S. intelligence, they've lied about who they're bombing.	0
You spearheaded the reset with Russia.	0
Did you underestimate the Russians, and as president, what would your response to Vladimir Putin be right now in Syria?	0
Well, first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin.	0
We got a nuclear arms deal, we got the Iranian sanctions, we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in Afghanistan.	0
There's no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship.	0
We have to stand up to his bullying, and specifically in Syria, it is important — and I applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the Russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict.	0
And, to — provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of Syria at the rate they are.	0
And, I think it's important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position, which is what I'm advocating.	0
Senator Sanders, what would you do differently.	0
Well, let's understand that when we talk about Syria, you're talking about a quagmire in a quagmire.	0
You're talking about groups of people trying to overthrow Assad, other groups of people fighting ISIS.	0
You're talking about people who are fighting ISIS using their guns to overthrow Assad, and vice versa.	0
I'm the former chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, and in that capacity I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war, and I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country.	0
We should be putting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort.	0
We should be supportive, but I do not support American ground troops in Syria.	0
On this issue of foreign policy, I want to go to...	0
...Well, nobody does.	0
Nobody does, Senator Sanders.	0
I want to go to Dana Bash.	0
Dana?	0
Governor Chafee, you were the only Republican in the Senate to vote against the Iraq war.	0
You say Secretary Clinton should be disqualified from the presidency because she voted in favor of using force in Iraq.	0
She has since said that her vote was a mistake.	0
Why isn't that good enough?	0
Well, we just heard Senator Sanders say that it's the worst decision in American history.	0
That's very significant, the worst decision in American history, I just heard from Senator Sanders.	0
So, as we look ahead, if you're going to make those poor judgment calls, a critical time in our history, we just finished with the Vietnam era, getting back into another quagmire — if you're looking ahead, and you're looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq — I know because I did my homework, and, so, that's an indication of how someone will perform in the future.	0
And that's what's important.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, he's questioning your judgment.	0
Well, I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then Senator Obama, debating this very issue.	0
After the election, he asked me to become Secretary of State.	0
He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him...	0
[ applause ]	0
...in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues.	0
You know, I — I agree completely.	0
We don't want American troops on the ground in Syria.	0
I never said that.	0
What I said was we had to put together a coalition — in fact, something that I worked on before I left the State Department — to do, and yes, that it should include Arabs, people in the region.	0
Because what I worry about is what will happen with ISIS gaining more territory, having more reach, and, frankly, posing a threat to our friends and neighbors in the region and far beyond.	0
So I think while you're talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran — I think I have a lot of evidence...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Sanders — Senator Sanders, I want to bring you in here.	0
My question for you is, as a congressman, you voted against the Iraq War.	0
You voted against the Gulf War.	0
You're just talking about Syria, but under what circumstances would a President Sanders actually use force?	0
Let me just respond to something the secretary said.	0
First of all, she is talking about, as I understand it, a no-fly zone in Syria, which I think is a very dangerous situation.	0
Could lead to real problems.	0
Second of all, I heard the same evidence from President Bush and Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld about why we should overthrow Saddam Hussein and get involved in the — I would urge people to go to berniesanders.com, hear what I said in 2002.	0
And I say, without any joy in my heart, that much of what I thought would happen about the destabilization, in fact, did happen.	0
So I think...	0
All right.	0
[ applause ]	0
I think the president is trying very hard to thread a tough needle here, and that is to support those people who are against Assad, against ISIS, without getting us on the ground there, and that's the direction I believe we should have (inaudible).	0
But, Senator Sanders, you didn't answer the question.	0
Under what — under what circumstances would you actually use force?	0
"Well, obviously, I voted, when President Clinton said, ""let's stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,"" I voted for that."	0
I voted to make sure that Osama bin Laden was held accountable in Afghanistan.	0
When our country is threatened, or when our allies are threatened, I believe that we need coalitions to come together to address the major crises of this country.	0
I do not support the United States getting involved in unilateral action.	0
You're at work with our allies.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I'm gonna bring you all in on this.	0
Governor — Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton...	0
I don't believe that any...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Secretary Clinton voted to authorize military force in Iraq, supported more troops in Afghanistan.	0
As Secretary of State, she wanted to arm Syrian rebels and push for the bombing of Libya.	0
Is she too quick to use military force?	0
Anderson, no president — no commander in chief — should take the military option off the table, even if most of us would agree that it should be the last option.	0
What disturbed people so much about — and I would agree with Senator Sanders on this — leading us into Iraq under false pretenses and telling us, as a people, that there were weapons of mass destruction there was — was one of the worst blunders in modern American history.	0
But the reason why people remain angry about it is because people feel like a lot of our legislators got railroaded in a war fever and by polls.	0
And I remember being at a dinner shortly before that invasion.	0
"People were talking at — and saying, ""it'll take us just a couple years to rebuild democracy,"" and I thought, ""has this world gone mad?"""	0
"Whenever we go — and contrary to John Quincy Adams' advice — ""searching the world for monsters to destroy,"" and when we use political might to take a — at the expense of democratic principle, we hurt ourselves, and we hurt our"	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
Does she — does she want to use military force too rapidly?	0
I believe that, as president, I would not be so quick to pull for a military tool.	0
I believe that a no-fly zone in Syria, at this time, actually, Secretary, would be a mistake.	0
You have to enforce no-fly zones, and I believe, especially with the Russian air force in the air, it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret.	0
I support President Obama.	0
I think we have to play a long game, and I think, ultimately — you want to talk about blunders?	0
I think Assad's invasion of Syria will be seen as a blunder.	0
Governor O'Malley, just for the record, on the campaign trail, you've been saying that Secretary Clinton is always quick for the — for the military intervention.	0
Senator — Secretary Clinton, you can respond.	0
Well, first of all, I...	0
Anderson, can I come into this discussion at some point?	0
Well — yes, you'll be coming in next, but she was directly quoted, Senator.	0
Thank you.	0
I've been standing over here for about ten minutes, trying.	0
OK.	0
It's just — it's gone back and forth over there.	0
Secretary?	0
Well, I am in the middle, here, and...	0
[ laughter ]	0
Lots of things coming from all directions.	0
You got the lucky	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
You know, I have to say, I was very pleased when Governor O'Malley endorsed me for president in 2008, and I enjoyed his strong support in that campaign.	0
And I consider him, obviously, a friend.	0
Let me say — because there's a lot of loose talk going on here — we are already flying in Syria just as we are flying in Iraq.	0
The president has made a very tough decision.	0
What I believe and why I have advocated that the no-fly zone — which of course would be in a coalition — be put on the table is because I'm trying to figure out what leverage we have to get Russia to the table.	0
You know, diplomacy is not about getting to the perfect solution.	0
It's about how you balance the risks.	0
Thank you.	0
And I think we have an opportunity here — and I know that inside the administration this is being hotly debated — to get that leverage to try to get the Russians to have to deal with everybody in the region and begin to move toward a political, diplomatic solution in Syria.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
"Senator Webb, you said as president you would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was, in your words, ""inevitable."""	0
Should Secretary Clinton have seen that attack coming?	0
Look, let's start — I've been trying to get in this conversation for about 10 minutes — let's start with why Russia is in Syria right now.	0
There are three strategic failings that have allowed this to occur.	0
The first was the invasion of Iraq, which destabilized ethnic elements in Iraq and empowered Iran.	0
The second was the Arab Spring, which created huge vacuums in Libya and in Syria that allowed terrorist movements to move in there.	0
And the third was the recent deal allowing Iran to move forward and eventually acquire a nuclear weapon, which sent bad signals, bad body language into the region about whether we are acquiescing in Iran becoming a stronger piece of the formula in that part of the world.	0
Now, I say this as someone who spent five years in the Pentagon and who opposed the war in Iraq, whose son fought in Iraq, I've fought in Vietnam.	0
But if you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China.	0
And we need to do this because of their aggression in the region.	0
We need to do it because of the way they treat their own people.	0
Senator...	0
And I would say this.	0
I've been waiting for 10 minutes.	0
I will say this.	0
You're over your time as of now.	0
I will — well, you've let a lot of people go over their time.	0
I would say this...	0
You agreed to these debate rules.	0
... to the unelected, authoritarian government of China: You do not own the South China Sea.	0
You do not have the right to conduct cyber warfare against tens of millions of American citizens.	0
And in a Webb administration, we will do something about that.	0
Senator Sanders, I want you to be able to respond.	0
Pardon me?	0
I'd like you to be able to respond and get in on this.	0
Well, I think Mr. Putin is going to regret what he is doing.	0
I think that when he gets into that...	0
He doesn't seem to be the type of guy to regret a lot.	0
Well, I think he's already regretting what he did in Crimea and what he is doing in the Ukraine.	0
I think he is really regretting the decline of his economy.	0
And I think what he is trying to do now is save some face.	0
But I think when Russians get killed in Syria and when he gets bogged down, I think the Russian people are going to give him a message that maybe they should come home, maybe they should start working with the United States to rectify the situation now.	0
Secretary Clinton, on the campaign trail, Governor Webb has said that he would never have used military force in Libya and that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was inevitable.	0
Should you have seen that attack coming?	0
Well, let's remember what was going on.	0
We had a murderous dictator, Gadhafi, who had American blood on his hands, as I'm sure you remember, threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people.	0
We had our closest allies in Europe burning up the phone lines begging us to help them try to prevent what they saw as a mass genocide, in their words.	0
"And we had the Arabs standing by our side saying, ""We want you to help us deal with Gadhafi."""	0
Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this.	0
We will provide essential, unique capabilities that we have, but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line.	0
We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya.	0
And I'll say this for the Libyan people...	0
But American citizens did lose their lives in Benghazi.	0
But let — I'll get to that.	0
But I think it's important, since I understand Senator Webb's very strong feelings about this, to explain where we were then and to point out that I think President Obama made the right decision at the time.	0
And the Libyan people had a free election the first time since 1951.	0
And you know what, they voted for moderates, they voted with the hope of democracy.	0
Because of the Arab Spring, because of a lot of other things, there was turmoil to be followed.	0
But unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous, which I do not, then when we send them forth, there is always the potential for danger and risk.	0
Governor O'Malley?	0
Can I...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Anderson, I think we are learning...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Anderson, I think there's lessons to be learned from Benghazi.	0
And those lessons are that we need to do a much better job as a nation of having human intelligence on the ground so that we know who the emerging next generation leaders are that are coming up to replace a dictator when his time on this planet ends.	0
And I believe that's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.	0
But he did not have the tools.	0
We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to make not only better decisions in Libya, but better decisions in Syria today.	0
And it's a huge national security failing.	0
Senator Webb, I want you to be able to respond.	0
Thank you.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Webb?	0
This is not about Benghazi per se.	0
To me it is the inevitability of something like Benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in Libya.	0
We had no treaties at risk.	0
We had no Americans at risk.	0
There was no threat of attack or imminent attack.	0
There is plenty of time for a president to come to the Congress and request authority to use military force in that situation.	0
I called for it on the Senate floor again and again.	0
I called for it in Senate hearings.	0
It is not a wise thing to do.	0
And if people think it was a wise thing to do, try to get to the Tripoli airport today.	0
You can't do it.	0
Secretary (sic) Webb, you served in Vietnam.	0
You're a marine.	0
Once a marine, always a marine.	0
You served as a marine in Vietnam.	0
You're a decorated war hero.	0
You eventually became secretary of the navy.	0
During the Vietnam War, the man standing next to you, Senator Sanders, applied for status as a conscientious objector.	0
Given his history, can he serve as a credible commander-in-chief?	0
Everybody makes their decisions when the time there is conscription.	0
And as long as they go through the legal process that our country requires, I respect that.	0
And it would be for the voters to decide whether Senator Sanders or anyone else should be president.	0
I will say this, coming from the position that I've come from, from a military family, with my brother a marine, my son was a marine in Iraq, I served as a marine, spending five years in the Pentagon, I am comfortable that I am the most qualified person standing up here today to be your commander-in-chief.	0
Senator Sanders, tell an American soldier who is watching right now tonight in Afghanistan why you can be commander-in- chief given that you applied for conscientious objector status.	0
Well, first of all, let me applaud my good friend Jim Webb for his service to this country in so many ways.	0
[ applause ]	0
Jim and I, under Jim's leadership, as he indicated, passed the most significant veterans education bill in recent history.	0
We followed suit with a few years later passing, under my leadership, the most significant veterans' health care legislation in the modern history of this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
When I was a young man — I'm not a young man today.	0
When I was a young man, I strongly opposed the war in Vietnam.	0
Not the brave men like Jim who fought in that war, but the policy which got us involved in that war.	0
That was my view then.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
I am not a pacifist, Anderson.	0
I supported the war in Afghanistan.	0
I supported President Clinton's effort to deal with ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.	0
I support air strikes in Syria and what the president is trying to do.	0
Yes, I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy.	0
But yes, I am prepared to take this country into war if that is necessary.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Very quickly, 30 seconds for each of you.	0
Governor Chafee, who or what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?	0
I want to go down the line.	0
OK.	0
I just have to answer one thing that Senator Webb said about the Iran deal, because I'm a strong proponent of what President Obama — and he said that because of that the Iran deal that enabled Russia to come in.	0
No, that's not true, Senator Webb.	0
I respect your foreign policy chops.	0
But Russia is aligned with Iran and with Assad and the Alawite Shias in Syria.	0
So that Iran deal did not allow Russia to come in.	0
OK.	0
Senator, I can give you 30 seconds to respond.	0
I believe that the signal that we sent to the region when the Iran nuclear deal was concluded was that we are accepting Iran's greater position on this very important balance of power, among our greatest ally Israel, and the Sunnis represented by the Saudi regime, and Iran.	0
It was a position of weakness and I think it encouraged the acts that we've seen in the past several weeks.	0
Thirty seconds for each of you.	0
Governor Chafee, what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?	0
It's certainly the chaos in the Middle East.	0
There's no doubt about it.	0
OK.	0
And it all started with the Iraq invasion.	0
Governor O'Malley?	0
I believe that nuclear Iran remains the biggest threat, along with the threat of ISIL; climate change, of course, makes cascading threats even more (inaudible).	0
Secretary Clinton, the greatest national security threat?	0
I — I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands.	0
I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it, and that's why we have to stay vigilant, but also united around the world to prevent that.	0
Senator Sanders, greatest national security threat?	0
The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable.	0
That is a major crisis.	0
Senator Webb?	0
Our greatest long-term strategic challenge is our relation with China.	0
Our greatest day-to-day threat is cyber warfare against this country.	0
Our greatest military-operational threat is resolving the situations in the Middle East.	0
All right.	0
We're going to take a short break.	0
Do these candidates see eye to eye on an issue that is driving a big wedge between Republicans?	0
That is next.	0
We'll be right back.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
And welcome back.	0
We are live in Nevada, in Las Vegas, at the Wynn Resort for the first Democratic presidential debate.	0
The questions continue.	0
We begin with Secretary Clinton.	0
Secretary Clinton, you are going to be testifying before Congress next week about your e-mails.	0
For the last eight months, you haven't been able to put this issue behind you.	0
You dismissed it; you joked about it; you called it a mistake.	0
What does that say about your ability to handle far more challenging crises as president?	0
Well, I've taken responsibility for it.	0
I did say it was a mistake.	0
What I did was allowed by the State Department, but it wasn't the best choice.	0
And I have been as transparent as I know to be, turning over 55,000 pages of my e-mails, asking that they be made public.	0
And you're right.	0
I am going to be testifying.	0
I've been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public, which was not originally agreed to.	0
But let's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee.	0
[ applause ]	0
It is a partisan vehicle, as admitted by the House Republican majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers.	0
Big surprise.	0
And that's what they have attempted to do.	0
I am still standing.	0
I am happy to be part of this debate.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people.	0
You know, I believe strongly that we need to be talking about what people talk to me about, like how are we going to make college affordable?	0
How are we going to pay down student debt?	0
Secretary...	0
How are we going to get health care for everybody...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Secretary Clinton, Secretary Clinton, with all due respect, it's a little hard — I mean, isn't it a little bit hard to call this just a partisan issue?	0
There's an FBI investigation, and President Obama himself just two days ago said this is a legitimate issue.	0
Well, I never said it wasn't legitimate.	0
I said that I have answered all the questions and I will certainly be doing so again before this committee.	0
But I think it would be really unfair not to look at the entire picture.	0
This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money, and they said that they were trying to figure out what we could do better to protect our diplomats so that something like Benghazi wouldn't happen again.	0
There were already seven committee reports about what to do.	0
So I think it's pretty clear what their obvious goal is.	0
Thank you.	0
But I'll be there.	0
I'll answer their questions.	0
But tonight, I want to talk not about my e-mails, but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Let me say this.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me say — let me say something that may not be great politics.	0
But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Me, too.	0
Me, too.	0
You know?	0
The middle class — Anderson, and let me say something about the media, as well.	0
I go around the country, talk to a whole lot of people.	0
Middle class in this country is collapsing.	0
We have 27 million people living in poverty.	0
We have massive wealth and income inequality.	0
Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs.	0
The American people want to know whether we're going to have a democracy or an oligarchy as a result of Citizens Union.	0
Enough of the e-mails.	0
Let's talk about the real issues facing America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Bernie.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
It's obviously very popular in this crowd, and it's — hold on.	0
[ applause ]	0
I know that plays well in this room.	0
But I got to be honest, Governor Chafee, for the record, on the campaign trail, you've said a different thing.	0
You said this is a huge issue.	0
Standing here in front of Secretary Clinton, are you willing to say that to her face?	0
Absolutely.	0
We have to repair American credibility after we told the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which he didn't.	0
So there's an issue of American credibility out there.	0
So any time someone is running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world.	0
And we have repair work to be done.	0
I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president.	0
That's how I feel.	0
Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?	0
No.	0
Governor — Governor...	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor O'Malley...	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor, it's popular in the room, but a lot of people do want to know these answers.	0
"Governor O'Malley, you expressed concern on the campaign trail that the Democratic Party is, and I quote, ""being defined by Hillary Clinton's email scandal."""	0
You heard her answer, do you still feel that way tonight?	0
I believe that now that we're finally having debates, Anderson, that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal, and how long — what the FBI's asking about.	0
Instead, we can talk about affordable college, making college debt free, and all the issues.	0
Which is why — and I see the chair of the DNC here, look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table.	0
We need to get wages to go up, college more affordable...	0
...Thank you, governor.	0
...we need to make American 100 percent clean electric by 2050.	0
I want to talk about issues of race in America, for that I want to start of with Don Lemon.	0
Alright, Anderson, thank you very much.	0
I'm not sure how to follow that, but this question is about something that has tripped some of the candidates up out on the campaign trail.	0
Can you hear me?	0
Can't hear me in the room.	0
OK, here we go again, as I said...	0
...law school.	0
My question for the candidates is, do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?	0
The question from Arthur...	0
...There we go...	0
...Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?	0
Let's put that question to Senator Sanders.	0
Black lives matter.	0
[	0
cheering ] And the reason — the reason those words matter is the African American community knows that on any given day some innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she's going to end up dead in jail, or their kids...	0
[ applause ]	0
...are going to get shot.	0
We need to combat institutional racism from top to bottom, and we need major, major reforms in a broken criminal justice system...	0
[ applause ]	0
...In which we have more people in jail than China.	0
And, I intended to tackle that issue.	0
To make sure that our people have education and jobs rather than jail cells.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor O'Malley, the question from Arthur was do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?	0
Anderson, the point that the Black Lives Matter movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, and that is that as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color.	0
When I ran for Mayor of Baltimore — and we we burying over 350 young men ever single year, mostly young, and poor, and black, and I said to our legislature, at the time when I appeared in front of them as a mayor, that if we were burying white, young, poor men in these number we would be marching in the streets and there would be a different reaction.	0
Black lives matter, and we have a lot of work to do to reform our criminal justice system, and to address race relations in our country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, what would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?	0
Well, I think that President Obama has been a great moral leader on these issues, and has laid out an agenda that has been obstructed by the Republicans at every turn, so...	0
[ applause ]	0
...So, what we need to be doing is not only reforming criminal justice — I have talked about that at some length, including things like body cameras, but we also need to be following the recommendations of the commissioner that President Obama empanelled on policing.	0
There is an agenda there that we need to be following up on.	0
Similarly, we need to tackle mass incarceration, and this may be the only bi-partisan issue in the congress this year.	0
We actually have people on both sides of the aisle who have reached the same conclusion, that we can not keep imprisoning more people than anybody else in the world.	0
But, I believe that the debate, and the discussion has to go further, Anderson, because we've got to do more about the lives of these children.	0
That's why I started off by saying we need to be committed to making it possible for every child to live up to his or her god given potential.	0
That is...	0
...Thank you, Senator...	0
...really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education...	0
Senator...	0
...if you don't have schools that are able to meet the needs of the people, or good housing, there's a long list...	0
[ applause ]	0
...We need a new New Deal for communities of color...	0
Senator Webb?	0
I hope I can get that kind of time here.	0
As a President of the United States, every life in this country matters.	0
At the same time, I believe I can say to you, I have had a long history of working with the situation of African Americans.	0
We're talking about criminal justice reform, I risked my political life raising the issue of criminal justice reform when I ran for the Senate in Virginia in 2006.	0
I had democratic party political consultants telling me I was committing political suicide.	0
We led that issue in the congress.	0
We started a national debate on it.	0
And it wasn't until then that the Republican Party started joining in.	0
I also represented a so-called war criminal, an African American Marine who was wounded — who was convicted of murder in Vietnam, for six years.	0
He took his life three years into this.	0
I cleared his name after — after three years.	0
Thanks, sir.	0
And I put the African American soldier on the Mall.	0
I made that recommendation and fought for it.	0
So, if you want someone who is — can stand up in front of you right now and say I have done the hard job, I have taken the risks, I am your person.	0
Senator Sanders, let's talk about income inequality.	0
Wages and incomes are flat.	0
You've argued that the gap between rich and poor is wider than at any time since the 1920s.	0
We've had a Democratic president for seven years.	0
What are you going to be able to do that President Obama didn't?	0
Well, first of all, let's remember where we were when Bush left office.	0
We were losing 800,000 jobs a month.	0
And I know my Republican friends seem to have some amnesia on this issue, but the world's financial crisis was on — the world's financial markets system was on the verge of collapse.	0
That's where we were.	0
Are we better off today than we were then?	0
Absolutely.	0
But the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing.	0
And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I'll let you jump in a moment.	0
Everybody will get in on this in a moment.	0
Secretary Clinton, how would you address this issue?	0
In all candor, you and your husband are part of the one percent.	0
How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class?	0
Well, you know, both Bill and I have been very blessed.	0
Neither of us came from wealthy families and we've worked really hard our entire lives.	0
And I want to make sure every single person in this country has the same opportunities that he and I have had, to make the most of their God-given potential and to have the chances that they should have in America for a good education, good job training, and then good jobs.	0
I have a five point economic plan, because this inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points.	0
It's absolutely right.	0
It hasn't been this bad since the 1920s.	0
But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy, there is no comparison.	0
The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that's why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017.	0
Governor O'Malley, (inaudible).	0
Yes.	0
Anderson, I want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from Vermont mentioned, and I actually did them in our state.	0
We raised the minimum wage, passed the living wage, invested more in infrastructure, went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition.	0
But there's another piece that Senator Sanders left out tonight, but he's been excellent about underscoring that.	0
And that is that we need to separate the casino, speculative, mega-bank gambling that we have to insure with our money, from the commercial banking — namely, reinstating Glass-Steagall.	0
Secretary Clinton mentioned my support eight years ago.	0
And Secretary, I was proud to support you eight years ago, but something happened in between, and that is, Anderson, a Wall Street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families.	0
And we are still just as vulnerable Paul Volcker says today.	0
We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates.	0
Just for viewers at home who may not be reading up on this, Glass-Steagall is the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities.	0
Secretary Clinton, he raises a fundamental difference on this stage.	0
Senator Sanders wants to break up the big Wall Street banks.	0
You don't.	0
You say charge the banks more, continue to monitor them.	0
Why is your plan better?	0
Well, my plan is more comprehensive.	0
And frankly, it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail.	0
We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw.	0
But we also have to worry about some of the other players — AIG, a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank.	0
"There's this whole area called ""shadow banking."""	0
That's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from.	0
So I'm with both Senator Sanders and Governor O'Malley in putting a lot of attention onto the banks.	0
And the plan that I have put forward would actually empower regulators to break up big banks if we thought they posed a risk.	0
But I want to make sure we're going to cover everybody, not what caused the problem last time, but what could cause it next time.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton just said that her policy is tougher than yours.	0
Well, that's not true.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Why?	0
Let us be clear that the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, where fraud is a business model, helped to destroy this economy and the lives of millions of people.	0
[ applause ]	0
Check the record.	0
"In the 1990s — and all due respect — in the 1990s, when I had the Republican leadership and Wall Street spending billions of dollars in lobbying, when the Clinton administration, when Alan Greenspan said, ""what a great idea it would be to allow these huge banks to merge,"" Bernie Sanders fought them, and helped lead the opposition to deregulation."	0
[ applause ]	0
Today, it is my view that when you have the three...	0
Senator...	0
...largest banks in America — are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail, we have got to break them up.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond.	0
He brought you up.	0
Yeah.	0
You know, I — I respect the passion an intensity.	0
"I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 — before the big crash that we had — and I basically said, ""cut it out!"	0
Quit foreclosing on homes!	0
"Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors."""	0
I took on the Bush administration for the same thing.	0
So I have thought deeply and long about what we're gonna do to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want, which is to rein in and stop this risk.	0
And my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail.	0
Nobody went to jail after $100 billion in fines were paid...	0
[ applause ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders...	0
But I'm telling you — I will say it tonight.	0
If only you look at the big banks, you may be missing the forest for the trees.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Bernie, say my name so I can get into this.	0
I will, just a second.	0
OK.	0
Thank you.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I'll tell him.	0
In my view, Secretary Clinton, you do not — Congress does not regulate Wall Street.	0
Wall Street regulates Congress.	0
[ applause ]	0
And we have gotta break off these banks.	0
Going to them...	0
So...	0
"...and saying, ""please, do the right thing""..."	0
...no, that's not what...	0
...is kind of naive.	0
...that — I think Dodd-Frank was a very...	0
Anderson, I need to jump in (inaudible).	0
...good start, and I think that we have to implement it.	0
We have to prevent the Republicans from ripping it apart.	0
We have to save the Consumer Financial Protection board, which is finally beginning to act to protect consumers.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have work to do.	0
You've got no argument from me.	0
But I know, if we don't come in with a very tough and comprehensive approach, like the plan I'm recommending, we're gonna be behind instead of ahead...	0
Governor O'Malley?	0
Where do you stand?	0
...on what the next crisis could be.	0
Anderson, look, this is — the big banks — I mean, once we repealed Glass-Steagall back in the late 1999s (ph), the big banks, the six of them, went from controlling, what, the equivalent of 15 percent of our GDP to now 65 percent of our GDP.	0
And — (inaudible) right before this debate, Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things.	0
But one of them that we still have a great difference on, Madam Secretary, is that you are not for Glass-Steagall.	0
You are not for putting a firewall between this speculative, risky shadow banking behavior.	0
I am, and the people of our country need a president who's on their side, willing to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street.	0
We have to fulfill...	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
...our promise.	0
I have to let you respond.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, you know, everybody on this stage has changed a position or two.	0
We've been around a cumulative quite some period of time.	0
[ laughter ]	0
You know, we know that if you are learning, you're gonna change your position.	0
I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.	1
But I have been on the forefront of dealing with climate change, starting in 2009, when President Obama and I crashed (ph) a meeting with the Chinese and got them to sign up to the first international agreement to combat climate change that they'd ever joined.	0
So I'm...	0
Thank you.	0
...not taking a back seat to anybody on my values...	0
Thank...	0
...my principles and the results that I get.	0
Senator Sanders...	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, in 2008, congressional leaders were told, without the 2008 bailout, the U.S. was possibly days away from a complete meltdown.	0
Despite that, you still voted against it.	0
As president, would you stand by your principles if it risked the country's financial stability?	0
Well, I remember that meeting very well.	0
I remember it like it was yesterday.	0
"Hank Paulson, Bernanke came in, and they say, ""guys, the economy is going to collapse because Wall Street is going under."	0
"It's gonna take the economy with them."""	0
And you know what I said to Hank Paulson?	0
"I said, ""Hank, your guys — you come from Goldman Sachs."	0
Your millionaire and billionaire friends caused this problem.	0
"How about your millionaire and billionaire friends paying for the bailout, not working families in this country?"""	0
So to answer your question, no, I would not have let the economy collapse.	0
But it was wrong to ask the middle class to bail out Wall Street.	0
And by the way, I want Wall Street now to help kids in this country go to college, public colleges and universities, free with a Wall Street speculation tax.	0
[ applause ]	0
We're going to talk about that in a minute.	0
But, Senator Webb, I want to get you in.	0
You have said neither party has the guts to take on Wall Street.	0
Is the system rigged?	0
There is a reality that I think we all need to recognize with respect to the power of the financial sector.	0
And let me just go back a minute and say that on this TARP program, I introduced a piece of legislation calling for a windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion, that it was time for them, once they got their compensation and their bonus, to split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out.	0
With respect to the financial sector, I mean, I know that my time has run out but in speaking of changing positions and the position on how this debate has occurred is kind of frustrating because unless somebody mentions my name I can't get into the discussion.	0
You agreed to these rules and you're wasting time.	0
So if you would finish your answer, we'll move on.	0
All right.	0
Well, I'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on.	0
This hasn't been equal time.	0
But if you want to look at what has happened, if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this, since that crash, in the last 10 years, the amount of the world's capital economy that Wall Street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent.	0
That means the Wall Street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the American people are when they're going to get their compensation.	0
They're managing money from all over the world.	0
We have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it.	0
Governor Chafee, you have attacked Secretary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street banks.	0
In 1999 you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger.	0
The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote, I'd just arrived, my dad had died in office, I was appointed to the office, it was my very first vote.	0
Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for?	0
I'd just arrived at the Senate.	0
I think we'd get some takeovers, and that was one.	0
It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5.	0
It was the...	0
Well, with all due respect, Governor...	0
But let me just say...	0
... what does that say about you that you're casting a vote for something you weren't really sure about?	0
I think you're being a little rough.	0
I'd just arrived at the United States Senate.	0
I'd been mayor of my city.	0
My dad had died.	0
I'd been appointed by the governor.	0
It was the first vote and it was 90-5, because it was a conference report.	0
But let me just say about income inequality.	0
We've had a lot of talk over the last few minutes, hours, or tens of minutes, but no one is saying how we're going to fix it.	0
And it all started with the Bush tax cuts that favored the wealthy.	0
So let's go back to the tax code.	0
And 0.6 percent of Americans are at the top echelon, over 464,000, 0.6 Americans.	0
That's less than 1 percent.	0
But they generate 30 percent of the revenue.	0
And they're doing fine.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
So there's still a lot more money to be had from this top echelon.	0
I'm saying let's have another tier and put that back into the tax bracket.	0
And that will generate $42 billion.	0
I want to bring in Dana Bash.	0
And then we can help the middle class and hard-earning Americans — hard-working Americans.	0
Dana?	0
Thank you.	0
CNN visited college campuses, along with Facebook.	0
And not surprisingly college affordability was among the most pressing issue.	0
Senator Sanders, you've mentioned a couple of times you do have a plan to make public colleges free for everyone.	0
Secretary Clinton has criticized that in saying she's not in favor of making a college free for Donald Trump's kids.	0
Do you think taxpayers should pick up the tab for wealthy children?	0
Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today — taxes in the future than they're paying today.	0
[ applause ]	0
But in terms of education, this is what I think.	0
This is the year 2015.	0
A college degree today, Dana, is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago.	0
And what we said 50 years ago and a hundred years ago is that every kid in this country should be able to get a high school education regardless of the income of their family.	0
I think we have to say that is true for everybody going to college.	0
I think we don't need a complicated system, which the secretary is talking about, the income goes down, the income goes down, if you're poor you have to work, and so forth and so on.	0
I pay for my program, by the way, through a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, it will substantially lower interest rates on college debt, a major crisis in this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
And, Secretary Clinton, it's not just college tuition that Senator Sanders is talking about, expanding Social Security and giving all Americans Medicare.	0
What's wrong with that?	0
Well, let me address college affordability, because I have a plan that I think will really zero in on what the problems are.	0
First, all the 40 million Americans who currently have student debt will be able to refinance their debt to a low interest rate.	0
That will save thousands of dollars for people who are now struggling under this cumbersome, burdensome college debt.	0
As a young student in Nevada said to me, the hardest thing about going to college should not be paying for it.	0
So then we have to make it more affordable.	0
How do we make it more affordable?	0
My plan would enable anyone to go to a public college or university tuition free.	0
You would not have to borrow money for tuition.	0
But I do believe — and maybe it's because I worked when I went through college; I worked when I went through law school — I think it's important for everybody to have some part of getting this accomplished.	0
That's why I call it a compact.	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
But, yes, I would like students to work 10 hours a week...	0
Can you answer the...	0
... in order to make it possible for them to afford their education.	0
And I want colleges to get their costs down.	0
They are outrageously high in what they're charging.	0
Secretary Clinton, the question was not just about tuition, though.	0
It was about Senator Sanders' plan to expand Social Security, to make Medicare available to all Americans.	0
Is that something that you would support?	0
And if not, why not?	0
Well, I fully support Social Security.	0
And the most important fight we're going to have is defending it against continuing Republican efforts to privatize it.	0
Do you want to expand it?	0
I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security.	0
We have a lot of women on Social Security, particularly widowed and single women who didn't make a lot of money during their careers, and they are impoverished, and they need more help from the Social Security system.	0
And I will focus — I will focus on helping those people who need it the most.	0
And of course I'm going to defend Social Security.	0
I'm going to look for ways to try to make sure it's solvent into the future.	0
And we also need to talk about health care at some time, because we agree on the goals, we just disagree on the means.	0
When the Republicans — when the Republicans in the Congress and some Democrats were talking about cutting Social Security and benefits for disabled veterans, for the so-called chained CPI, I founded a caucus called the Defending Social Security Caucus.	0
My view is that when you have millions of seniors in this country trying to get by — and I don't know how they do on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year — you don't cut Social Security, you expand it.	0
And the way you expand it is by lifting the cap on taxable incomes so that you do away with the absurdity of a millionaire paying the same amount into the system as somebody making $118,000.	0
You do that, Social Security is solvent until 2061 and you can expand benefits.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Sanders, I want to bring it over to Juan Carlos Lopez from CNN en Espanol.	0
We're obviously in Nevada.	0
It's had the highest percentage of undocumented immigrants of any state in the country as of last year.	0
Juan Carlos?	0
Gracias, Anderson.	0
Senator Sanders, in 2013, you voted for immigration reform.	0
But in 2007, when Democrats controlled Congress and the Bush White House was onboard, you voted against it.	0
Why should Latino voters trust you now when you left them at the altar at the moment when reform was very close?	0
I didn't leave anybody at the altar.	0
I voted against that piece of legislation because it had guest-worker provisions in it which the Southern Poverty Law Center talked about being semi-slavery.	0
Guest workers are coming in, they're working under terrible conditions, but if they stand up for their rights, they're thrown out of the country.	0
I was not the only progressive to vote against that legislation for that reason.	0
Tom Harkin, a very good friend of Hillary Clinton's and mine, one of the leading labor advocates, also voted against that.	0
Tom Harkin isn't running for president.	0
You are.	0
I know that.	0
But point being is that progressives did vote against that for that reason.	0
My view right now — and always has been — is that when you have 11 million undocumented people in this country, we need comprehensive immigration reform, we need a path toward citizenship, we need to take people out of the shadows.	0
And Juan Carlos — Juan Carlos...	0
Secretary Clinton — Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley wants to open up Obamacare to millions of undocumented immigrants and their children, including almost 90,000 people right here in Nevada.	0
Do you?	0
Well, first of all, I want to make sure every child gets health care.	0
That's why I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, and I want to support states that are expanding health care and including undocumented children and others.	0
I want to open up the opportunity for immigrants to be able to buy in to the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.	0
I think to go beyond that, as I understand what Governor O'Malley has recommended, so that they would get the same subsidies.	0
I think that is — it raises so many issues.	0
It would be very difficult to administer, it needs to be part of a comprehensive immigration reform, when we finally do get to it.	0
Governor O'Malley?	0
Juan Carlos, I think what you've heard up here is some of the old thinking on immigration reform, and that's why it's gridlocked.	0
We need to understand that our country is stronger in every generation by the arrival of new American immigrants.	0
That is why I have put out a policy for comprehensive immigration reform, that is why I would go further than President Obama has on DACA, and DAPA.	0
I mean, we are a nation of immigrants, we are made stronger by immigrants.	0
Do you think for a second that simply because somebody's standing in a broken que on naturalization they're not going to go to the hospital, and that care isn't going to fall on to our insurance rates?	0
I am for a generous, compassionate America that says we're all in this together.	0
We need comprehensive	0
Senator Webb...	0
...immigration reform.	0
It'll make wages go up in America $250 for every year...	0
Senator Webb, do you support the undocumented immigrants getting Obamacare?	0
I wouldn't have a problem with that.	0
Let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant.	0
She was a refugee, her family escaped from Vietnam on a boat-- her entire extended family, after the communists took over, when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying.	0
Went to two refugee camps, she never spoke English in her home, and she ended, as I said, graduating from Cornell Law School.	0
That's not only American dream, that's a value that we have with a good immigration system in place.	0
No country has — is a country without defining its borders.	0
We need to resolve this issue.	0
I actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill...	0
...Thank you, Senator.	0
...Giving a pathway to citizenship to those people who had come here, and put down their roots, and met as a series of standards...	0
...Thank you, Senator.	0
...lost (ph) — I introduced that in 2007 — We need a comprehensive reform, and we need to be able to define our borders.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
I want to follow up because I think underneath Juan Carlos' important questions, there is such a difference between everything you're hearing here on this stage, and what we hear from the Republicans.	0
[ applause ]	0
Here.	0
Here.	0
(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)	0
Demonize hard-working immigrants who have insulted them.	0
You know, I came to Las Vegas in, I think, May.	0
Early may.	0
Met with a group of DREAMers, I wish everybody in America could meet with this young people, to hear their stories, to know their incredible talent, their determination, and that's why I would go further...	0
...Secretary...	0
...than even the executive orders that President Obama has signed when I'm president.	0
(CROSS TALK)	0
Secretary Clinton, let me ask you.	0
Two of your rivals from your left, Governor O'Malley, and Senator Sanders, want to provide instate college tuition to undocumented immigrants.	0
Where do you stand on that?	0
My plan would support any state that takes that position, and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing.	0
So, on the record, you believe that undocumented immigrants should get instate college tuition.	0
If their states agree, then we want more states to do the same thing.	0
Governor O'Malley?	0
Anderson, we actually did this in my state of Maryland.	0
We passed...	0
[ applause ]	0
We passed a state version of the DREAM Act...	0
(CHEERING)	0
...And a lot of the xenophobes, the immigrant haters like some that we've heard like, Donald Trump, that carnival barker in the Republican party...	0
(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)	0
Tried to mischaracterize it as free tuition for illegal immigrants.	0
But, we took our case to the people when it was petitioned to referendum, and we won with 58 percent of the vote.	0
The more our children learn, the more they will earn, and that's true of children who have yet to be naturalized...	0
...Senator...	0
...but will become American citizens...	0
Senator Sanders, you talked about your record on the Veteran affairs committee.	0
You served on that committee for the last eight years, including two years as its chairman while veterans died waiting for health care.	0
You and Senator McCain ultimately addressed the issue with bi-partisan legislation.	0
Why did it take 18 Inspector General reports, and a CNN investigation, and others, before you and your colleagues took action?	0
Well, I was chairman for two years, and when I was chairman we did take action.	0
What we did is pass a $15 billion dollar piece of legislation which brought in many, many new doctors, and nurses into the V.A.	0
so that veterans in this country could get the health care when they needed it, and not be on long waiting lines.	0
And, the other part of that legislation said that if a veteran is living more than 40 miles away from a V.A.	0
facility, that veteran could get health care from the community health center, or the private sector.	0
As a result of that legislation, we went further in than any time in recent history in improving health care for the men and women of this country who put their lives on the line to defend them.	0
Governor Chafee, you and Hillary Clinton both voted for the Patriot Act which created the NSA surveillance program.	0
You've emphasized civil liberties, privacy during your campaign.	0
Aren't these two things in conflict?	0
No, that was another 99 to one vote for the Patriot Act, and it was seen as at the time modernizing our ability to do what we've always done to tap phones which always required a warrant.	0
And I voted for that.	0
Do you regret that vote?	0
No, no.	0
As long as you're getting a warrant, I believe that under the Fourth Amendment, you should be able to do surveillance, but you need a warrant.	0
That's what the Fourth Amendment says.	0
And in the Patriot Act, section 215 started to get broadened too far.	0
So I would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the Patriot Act.	0
Secretary Clinton, do you regret your vote on the Patriot Act?	0
No, I don't.	0
I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed.	0
And it is true that it did require that there be a process.	0
What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process.	0
And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in.	0
We always have to keep the balance of civil liberties, privacy and security.	0
It's not easy in a democracy, but we have to keep it in mind.	0
Senator — Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage who voted against the Patriot Act in 2001...	0
[ applause ]	0
It was 99 to one and I was maybe the one.	0
I don't know.	0
... and the reauthorization votes.	0
Let me ask you, if elected, would you shut down the NSA surveillance program?	0
I'm sorry?	0
Would you shut down the NSA surveillance program?	0
Absolutely.	0
Of course.	0
You would, point blank.	0
Well, I would shut down — make — I'd shut down what exists right now is that virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA.	0
That is unacceptable to me.	0
But it's not just government surveillance.	0
I think the government is involved in our e-mails; is involved in our websites.	0
Corporate America is doing it as well.	0
If we are a free country, we have the right to be free.	0
Yes, we have to defend ourselves against terrorism, but there are ways to do that without impinging on our constitutional rights and our privacy rights.	0
Anderson, the NSA...	0
Governor Chafee, Edward Snowden, is he a traitor or a hero?	0
No, I would bring him home.	0
The courts have ruled that what he did — what he did was say the American...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Bring him home, no jail time?	0
... the American government was acting illegally.	0
That's what the federal courts have said; what Snowden did showed that the American government was acting illegally for the Fourth Amendment.	0
So I would bring him home.	0
Secretary Clinton, hero or traitor?	0
He broke the laws of the United States.	0
He could have been a whistleblower.	1
He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower.	1
He could have raised all the issues that he has raised.	0
And I think there would have been a positive response to that.	0
Should he do jail time?	0
In addition — in addition, he stole very important information that has unfortunately fallen into a lot of the wrong hands.	0
So I don't think he should be brought home without facing the music.	0
Governor O'Malley, Snowden?	0
[ applause ]	0
Anderson, Snowden put a lot of Americans' lives at risk.	0
Snowden broke the law.	0
Whistleblowers do not run to Russia and try to get protection from Putin.	0
If he really believes that, he should be back here.	0
Senator Sanders, Edward Snowden?	0
I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined.	0
Is he a hero?	0
He did — he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that.	0
But I think what he did in educating us should be taken into consideration before he is (inaudible).	0
Senator Webb, Edward Snowden?	0
I — well, I — I would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system.	0
Here's what I do believe.	0
We have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country.	0
"And one of the things that I did during the FISA bill in 2007, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was introduce with Russ Feingold two amendments basically saying, ""We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought — if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them."""	0
We've got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use.	0
And they need to be destroyed.	0
Another — another question for each of you, starting with Governor Chafee.	0
Name the one thing — the one way that your administration would not be a third term of President Obama.	0
Certainly, ending the wars.	0
We've got to stop these wars.	0
You have to have a new dynamic, a new paradigm.	0
We just spent a half-billion dollars arming and training soldiers, the rebel soldiers in Syria.	0
They quickly join the other side.	0
We bombed the...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
President Obama's generals right now are suggesting keeping troops in Afghanistan after the time he wanted them pulled out.	0
Would you keep them there?	0
I'd like to finish my question — my answer.	0
And also we just bombed a hospital.	0
We've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings.	0
So I would change how we — our approach to the Middle East.	0
We need a new paradigm in the Middle East.	0
Governor O'Malley, how would you be different than President Obama's administration?	0
I would follow through on the promise that the American people thought we made as Democratic Party, to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street.	0
I would push to separate out these too-big-to-jail, too-big-to-fail banks, and put in place Glass-Steagall, a modern Glass-Steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again.	0
Secretary Clinton, how would you not be a third term of President Obama?	0
Well, I think that's pretty obvious.	0
I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we've had up until this point, including President Obama.	0
Is there a policy difference?	0
Well, there's a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama, but also, as I'm laying out, to go beyond.	0
And that's in my economic plans, how I would deal with the prescription drug companies, how I would deal with college, how I would deal with a full range of issues that I've been talking about throughout this campaign to go further.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
I have a lot of respect for president Obama.	0
I have worked with him time and time again on many, many issues.	0
But here's where I do disagree.	0
I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say: Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama?	0
I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I — Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come.	0
And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.	0
And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority.	0
I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee.	0
I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing.	0
So I would lead — working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).	0
Senator Sanders, he cited you.	0
You don't hear a lot of Democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution.	0
What do you mean?	0
What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest.	0
We need to raise public consciousness.	0
We need the American people to know what's going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know.	0
[ applause ]	0
And when people come together in a way that does not exist now and are prepared to take on the big money interest, then we could bring the kind of change we need.	0
Anderson, I actually have talked about a revolution.	0
What we need is a green energy revolution.	0
We need to move America to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.	0
And we want to — and we're going to talk more about climate change and environmental issues coming up.	0
Some of the candidates have tried marijuana, as have pretty much — probably everybody in this room.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Others have not.	0
Does that influence — does it influence their views on legalization?	0
Find out that and others ahead.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
And welcome back to this CNN Democratic presidential debate.	0
It has been quite a night so far.	0
We are in the final block of this debate.	0
All the candidates are back, which I'm very happy to see.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
It's a long story.	0
Let's continue, shall we?	0
Secretary Clinton, welcome back.	0
Well, thank you.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
You know, it does take me a little longer.	0
That's all I can say.	0
That's right.	0
Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley says the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth between two royal families.	0
This year has been the year of the outsider in politics, just ask Bernie Sanders.	0
Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself?	0
Well, I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president, but I'm not just running because I would be the first woman president.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'm running because I have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people, fighting for kids, for women, for families, fighting to even the odds.	0
And I know what it takes to get things done.	0
I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground.	0
And I think we're going to need both of those in Washington to get anything that we're talking about up here accomplished.	0
So I'm very happy that I have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the American people.	0
Governor O'Malley, do you want to tell Secretary Clinton why she shouldn't get the crown?	0
Well, actually, you know, we had this conversation.	0
And I will share with you that I've traveled all around the country, Anderson, and there's two phrases I keep hearing again and again and again.	0
"And they're the phrases ""new leadership"" and ""getting things done."""	0
We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward.	0
I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country.	0
But our country needs new leadership to move forward.	0
Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond, if you want.	0
Well, I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name.	0
I would ask them to listen to what I'm proposing, look at what I've accomplished in the Senate, as secretary of of state, and then draw your own conclusion.	0
I certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is Clinton.	0
I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans, because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States.	0
(inaudible).	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, does she have the right stuff?	0
I think — I think that there is profound frustration all over this country with establishment politics.	0
I am the only candidate running for president who is not a billionaire, who has raised substantial sums of money, and I do not have a super PAC.	0
[ applause ]	0
I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires, and in fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties — 100,000 people in this country — watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country.	0
we've got — we — a lot of questions we've got about climate change, and we're gonna go to Don Lemon.	0
Don?	0
All right.	0
This one is for Martin O'Malley.	0
Anderson, Governor O'Malley, this is from Anna Bettis from Tempe, Arizona.	0
Here it is.	0
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	0
As a young person, I'm very concerned about climate change and how it will affect my future.	0
As a presidential candidate, what will you do to address climate change?	0
(END VIDEO CLIP)	0
So, Governor O'Malley, please tell Anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates up on that stage.	0
Yeah.	0
Anna, I have put forward a plan — and I'm the only candidate, I believe, in either party to do this — to move America forward to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.	0
We did not land a man on the moon with an all-of-the-above strategy.	0
It was an intentional engineering challenge, and we solved it as a nation.	0
And our nation must solve this one.	0
So I put forward the plan that would extend the investor tax credits for solar and for wind.	0
If you go across Iowa, you see that 30 percent of their energy now comes from wind.	0
We're here in Las Vegas, one of the most sustainable cities in America, doing important things in terms of green building, architecture and design.	0
We can get there as a nation, but it's going to require presidential leadership.	0
And as president, I intend to sign as my very first order in office the — an order that moves us as a nation and dedicates our resources to solving this problem and moving us to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.	0
Governor...	0
We can do it.	0
...Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Webb, you have a very different view than just about anybody else on this stage, and unlike a lot of Democrats.	0
You're pro-coal, you're pro-offshore drilling, you're pro-Keystone pipeline.	0
Are — again, are you — the question is, are you out of step with the Democratic party?	0
Well, the — the question really is how are we going to solve energy problems here and in the global environment if you really want to address climate change?	0
And when I was in the Senate, I was an all-of-the-above energy voter.	0
We introduced legislation to bring in alternate energy as well as nuclear power.	0
I'm a strong proponent of nuclear power.	0
It is safe, it is clean.	0
And really, we are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here.	0
We've done a good job in this country since 1970.	0
If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world.	0
Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries.	0
We need to solve this in a global way.	0
It's a global problem and I have been very strong on — on doing that.	0
The — the agreements — the so-called agreements that we have had with China are illusory in terms of the immediate requirements of the — of the Chinese government itself.	0
So let's solve this problem in an international way, and then we really will have a — a way to address climate change.	0
Senator Sanders, are you tougher on — on climate change than Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I will tell you this.	0
I believe — and Pope Francis made this point.	0
This is a moral issue.	0
The scientists are telling us that we need to move extremely boldly.	0
I am proud that, along with Senator Barbara Boxer, a few years ago, we introduced the first piece of climate change legislation which called for a tax on carbon.	0
And let me also tell you that nothing is gonna happen unless we are prepared to deal with campaign finance reform, because the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party, which denies the reality of climate change...	0
[ applause ]	0
...and certainly is not prepared to go forward aggressively.	0
This is a moral issue.	0
We have got to be extremely aggressive in working with China, India, Russia.	0
Senator — thank you, Senator.	0
The planet — the future of the planet is at stake.	0
Secretary Clinton, I want you to be able to respond, then I'm gonna go to (ph) (inaudible).	0
Well, that — that's exactly what I've been doing.	0
When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and, literally, President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese, going throughout this huge convention center, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something.	0
Because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world.	0
They told us they'd left for the airport; we found out they were having a secret meeting.	0
"We marched up, we broke in, we said, ""We've been looking all over for you."	0
"Let's sit down and talk about what we need to do."""	0
And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed.	0
Thanks to President Obama's leadership, it's now gone much further.	0
Thank you.	0
And I do think that the bilateral agreement that President Obama made with the Chinese was significant.	0
Now, it needs to go further, and there will be an international meeting at the end of this year, and we must get verifiable commitments to fight climate change from every country gathered there.	0
Dana Bash?	0
Secretary Clinton, you now support mandated paid family leave.	0
Mm-hmm.	0
"Carly Fiorina, the first female CEO of a Fortune 50 company, argues, if the government requires paid leave, it will force small businesses to, quote, ""hire fewer people and create fewer jobs."""	0
What do you say not only to Carly Fiorina, but also a small-business owner out there who says, you know, I like this idea, but I just can't afford it?	0
Well, I'm surprised she says that, because California has had a paid leave program for a number of years.	0
And it's...	0
It's on the federal level.	0
Well, but all — well, on a state level, a state as big as many countries in the world.	0
And it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have.	0
And I think this is — this is typical Republican scare tactics.	0
We can design a system and pay for it that does not put the burden on small businesses.	0
I remember as a young mother, you know, having a baby wake up who was sick and I'm supposed to be in court, because I was practicing law.	0
I know what it's like.	0
And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents face, particularly working moms.	0
I see my good friend, Senator Gillibrand, in the front row.	0
She's been a champion of this.	0
We need to get a consensus through this campaign, which is why I'm talking about it everywhere I go, and we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it.	0
But Secretary — Secretary Clinton, even many people who agree with you might say, look, this is very hard to do, especially in today's day and age.	0
"There are so many people who say, ""Really?"	0
Another government program?	0
Is that what you're proposing?	0
"And at the expense of taxpayer money?"""	0
"Well, look, you know, when people say that — it's always the Republicans or their sympathizers who say, ""You can't have paid leave, you can't provide health care."""	0
They don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood.	0
They're fine with big government when it comes to that.	0
I'm sick of it.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, we can do these things.	0
[ applause ]	0
"We should not be paralyzed — we should not be paralyzed by the Republicans and their constant refrain, ""big government this, big government that,"" that except for what they want to impose on the American people."	0
I know we can afford it, because we're going to make the wealthy pay for it.	0
That is the way to get it done.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Yeah, Dana, here's the point: Every other major country on Earth, every one, including some small countries, say that when a mother has a baby, she should stay home with that baby.	0
We are the only major country.	0
That is an international embarrassment that we do not provide family — paid family and medical leave.	0
[ applause ]	0
Second of all, the secretary is right.	0
Republicans tell us we can't do anything except give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.	0
That's not what the American people want.	0
Governor O'Malley?	0
Anderson, in our state, we actually expanded family leave.	0
And I have to agree with Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders.	0
Look, the genius of our nation is that we find ways in every generation to include more of our people more fully in the economic life of our country, and we need to do that for our families, and especially so that women aren't penalized in having to drop out of the workforce.	0
My wife, Katie, is here with our four kids.	0
And, man, that was a juggle when we had little kids and — and keeping jobs and moving forwards.	0
We would be a stronger nation economically if we had paid family leave.	0
Governor, thank you.	0
The issue now, particularly in this state, is recreational marijuana.	0
I want to go to Juan Carlos Lopez.	0
Thank you, Anderson.	0
Senator Sanders, right here in Nevada, there will be a measure to legalize recreational marijuana on the 2016 ballot.	0
You've said you smoked marijuana twice; it didn't quite work for you.	0
If you were a Nevada resident, how would you vote?	0
I suspect I would vote yes.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses.	0
We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana.	1
I think we have to think through this war on drugs...	0
[ applause ]	0
...which has done an enormous amount of damage.	0
We need to rethink our criminal justice system, we we've got a lot of work to do in that area.	0
Juan Carlos?	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, you told Christiane Amanpour you didn't smoke pot when you were young, and you're not going to start now.	0
[ laughter ]	0
When asked about legalizing recreational marijuana, you told her let's wait and see how it plays out in Colorado and Washington.	0
It's been more than a year since you've said that.	0
Are you ready to take a position tonight?	0
No.	0
I think that we have the opportunity through the states that are pursuing recreational marijuana to find out a lot more than we know today.	0
I do support the use of medical marijuana, and I think even there we need to do a lot more research so that we know exactly how we're going to help people for whom medical marijuana provides relief.	0
So, I think we're just at the beginning, but I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana.	0
Therefore, we need more states, cities, and the federal government to begin to address this so that we don't have this terrible result that Senator Sanders was talking about where we have a huge population in our prisons for nonviolent, low-level offenses that are primarily due to marijuana.	0
Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
I want to go to Don Lemon with another Facebook question.	0
Alright, Anderson.	0
This is for Senator Sanders, OK?	0
"This is from Carrie (ph) Kang (ph) from Manassas, Virginia, would like would like to ask the Senator, ""President Obama has had a difficult time getting Republicans to compromise on just about every agenda."	0
"How will you approach this going forward, and will it be any different?"""	0
Senator?	0
The Republican party, since I've been in the Senate, and since President Obama has been in office, has played a terrible, terrible role of being total obstructionists.	0
Every effort that he has made, that some of us have made, they have said no, no, no.	0
Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right wing republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us elected President...	0
[ applause ]	0
...But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together.	0
If we want free tuition at public colleges and universities, millions of young people are going to have to demand it, and give the Republicans an offer they can't refuse.	0
"If we want to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour, workers are going to have to come together and look the Republicans in the eye, and say, ""We know what's going on."	0
"You vote against us, you are out of your job."""	0
[ applause ]	0
We're going to hear from all the candidates coming up.	0
We're going to take a short break.	0
More from the candidates in a moment.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
And welcome back to the final round of the CNN Democratic presidential debate.	0
This is a question to each of you.	0
Each of you, by the way, are going to have closing statements to make.	0
Each of you will have 90 seconds.	0
But a final question to each of you.	0
If you can, just try to — 15 seconds if you can.	0
"Governor Chafee, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, ""I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."""	0
You've all made a few people upset over your political careers.	0
Which enemy are you most proud of?	0
[ laughter ]	0
I guess the coal lobby.	0
I've worked hard for climate change and I want to work with the coal lobby.	0
But in my time in the Senate, tried to bring them to the table so that we could address carbon dioxide.	0
I'm proud to be at odds with the coal lobby.	0
Governor O'Malley?	0
The National Rifle Association.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Probably the Republicans.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
Senator Sanders?	0
As someone who has taken on probably every special interest that there is in Washington, I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my life of people who do not like me.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Webb?	0
I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.	0
All right.	0
Time for closing statements.	0
Each of you will have 90 seconds.	0
Governor Chafee, let's begin with you.	0
Thank you, Anderson.	0
Thank you, CNN.	0
And thank you, Facebook, for sponsoring this debate.	0
America has many challenges confronting us — ending the perpetual wars, addressing climate change, addressing income inequality, funding education, funding infrastructure, funding healthcare, helping black Americans, helping Native Americans.	0
We have many challenges.	0
Who is best able to confront these challenges?	0
I've served in government at many levels.	0
I know what it's like to solve problems at the local level because I did it as mayor.	0
I know how to get legislation passed through Congress because I did it as a senator.	0
I know how to turn around a state because I did as governor of Rhode Island.	0
But what I'm most proud of is that in 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals.	0
I have high ethical standards.	0
And what I'm most proud of is my judgment, particularly in the Iraq war vote.	0
There was a lot of pressure — political pressure, public pressure.	0
But I did my homework and I did not believe that the evidence was there that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.	0
And we live now with the consequences.	0
So that kind of judgment is what we want in a president going forward.	0
And I'm running for president to end the wars.	0
I want to be the peacemaker.	0
I am a proven peacemaker.	0
Please go to Chafee 2016 to learn more about me.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Chafee, thank you very much.	0
Senator Webb, your final statement for 90 seconds.	0
Thank you.	0
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to be with you tonight.	0
You've heard a lot of promises up here; you've heard a lot of rhetoric.	0
They all seem to happen during campaigns, and then once the election's over, people start from scratch again and try to get things done.	0
One of the things I can promise you, if you look at my record, in and out of government, is that I've always been willing to take on a complicated, something unpopular issues, and work them through, the complex issues, and work them through in order to have the solution.	0
We did it with criminal justice reform.	0
We've had a lot of discussion here about criminal justice reform.	0
We did it in other ways.	0
We need a national political strategy for our economy, for our social policy, for social justice, and, by the way, for how you run and manage the most complex bureaucracy in the world, which is the federal government.	0
I know how to lead.	0
I did it in Vietnam, I did it in the Pentagon, I did it in the Senate, and if you will help me overcome this cavalcade of — of financial irregularities and money that is poisoning our political process, I am ready to do that for you in the White House.	0
Senator Webb, thank you very much.	0
Governor O'Malley, you have 90 seconds.	0
Anderson, thank you.	0
I am very, very grateful to have been able to be on this stage with this distinguished group of candidates tonight.	0
And what you heard tonight, Anderson, was a very, very — and all of you watching at home — was a very, very different debate than from the sort of debate you heard from the two presidential Republican debates.	0
[ applause ]	0
On this stage — on this stage, you didn't hear anyone denigrate women, you didn't hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn't hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief.	0
What you heard instead on this stage tonight was an honest search for the answers that will move our country forward, to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050, to take the actions that we have always taken as Americans so that we can actually attack injustice in our country, employ more of our people, rebuild our cities and towns, educate our children at higher and better levels, and include more of our people in the economic, social, and political life of our country.	0
I truly believe that we are standing on the threshold of a new era of American progress.	0
Unless you've become discouraged about our gridlock in Congress, talk to our young people under 30, because you'll never find among them people that want to bash immigrants or people that want to deny rights to gay couples.	0
[ applause ]	0
That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor O'Malley, thank you very much.	0
Senator Sanders, final, closing thoughts, 90 seconds.	0
This is a great country, but we have many, many serious problems.	0
We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country.	0
We should not be the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all of our people as a right of citizenship and we should not be the only major country that does not provide medical and — and parental leave — family and parental leave to all of our families.	0
Now, at the end of our day, here is the truth that very few candidates will say, is that nobody up here, certainly no Republican, can address the major crises facing our country unless millions of people begin to stand up to the billionaire class that has so much power over our economy and our political life.	0
Jim Webb is right: Money is pouring in to this campaign through super PACs.	0
We are doing it the old-fashioned way: 650,000 individual contributions.	0
And if people want to help us out, BernieSanders.com.	0
We are averaging $30 bucks apiece.	0
We would appreciate your help.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Thank you very much, Anderson.	0
And thanks to all the viewers who tuned in tonight.	0
I think what you did see is that, in this debate, we tried to deal with some of the very tough issues facing our country.	0
That's in stark contrast to the Republicans who are currently running for president.	0
What you have to ask yourself is: Who amongst us has the vision for actually making the changes that are going to improve the lives of the American people?	0
Who has the tenacity and the ability and the proven track record of getting that done?	0
Now, I revere my late mother, and she gave me a lot of good advice.	0
But one of the best pieces of advice she gave me was, you know, the issue is not whether or not you get knocked down.	0
It's whether you get back up.	0
America's been knocked down.	0
That Great Recession, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, $13 trillion in wealth disappeared.	0
And although we've made progress, we're standing but not running the way America needs to.	0
My mission as president will be to raise incomes for hard-working middle-class families and to make sure that we get back to the basic bargain I was raised with: If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.	0
Please join me in this campaign.	0
Please come and make it clear that America's best days are still ahead.	0
Thank you very much.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, that does it for this Democratic presidential debate.	0
On behalf of everyone at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, our debate partners at Facebook, the Wynn Resort, and the Democratic National Committee.	0
Thanks also to Dana Bash, Juan Carlos Lopez, and Don Lemon.	0
We'll be back in Las Vegas December 15th, when CNN hosts our next Republican presidential debate.	0
That will be moderated by my colleague, Wolf Blitzer.	0
Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you.	0
We, the citizens of America are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.	0
Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.	0
We will face challenges.	0
We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.	0
Every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.	0
And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.	0
They have been magnificent.	0
Thank you.	0
Today’s ceremony however, has very special meaning, because today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC.	0
And giving it back to you, the people.	0
For too long, have reaped the rewards of government while people have borne the cost.	0
Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.	0
Politicians prospered period, but the jobs left and the factories closed.	0
The establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country.	0
Their victories have not been your victories.	0
Their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.	0
That all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment.	0
It belongs to you.	0
It be longs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.	0
This is your day.	0
This is your celebration.	0
And this, the United States of America, is your country.	0
What truly matters is not what truly controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people.	0
January 20, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.	0
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.	0
Everyone is listening to you now, you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.	1
At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction, that a nation exists to serve its citizens.	0
Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.	0
These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.	0
But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.	0
Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation, an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.	1
And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.	1
This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.	0
We are one nation and their pain is our pain.	0
Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success.	0
We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.	0
The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.	0
For many decades, we have enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.	1
We have defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own.	1
And spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.	1
We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.	1
One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.	0
The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.	0
But that is the pass and now we are looking only to the future.	0
We assemble here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every hall of power.	0
From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.	0
From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first.	0
Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.	0
We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.	0
Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.	0
I will fight for you with every breath in my body.	0
And I will never ever let you down.	0
America will start winning again, winning like never before.	0
We will bring back our jobs.	0
We will bring back our borders.	0
We will bring back our wealth.	0
And we will bring back our dreams.	0
We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.	0
We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.	0
We will follow two simple rules, buy American and hire American.We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.	1
We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example.	0
We will shine for everyone to follow.	0
We will reinforce old alliances and form new wurns and reform the world against radical islamic terrorism which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.	0
At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.	0
When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.	0
The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when god's people live together in unity.	0
We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue sold art.	0
When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.	0
There should be no fear.	0
We are protected and we will always be protected.	0
We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.	0
And most importantly, we will be protected by God.	0
Finally, must think big and dream even bigger.	0
In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long it is striving.	0
We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.	0
The time for empty talk is over.	0
Now arrives the hour of action.	0
Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.	0
No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.	0
We will not fail.	0
Our country will thrive and prosper again.	0
We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the missries of disease and harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.	0
A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.	0
It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.	0
We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms.	0
And we all salute the same great American flag.	0
And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the wind-swept plains of nebraska, they look at the same night sky.	0
They fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.	0
So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words, you will never be ignored again.	0
Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny.	0
And your courage, goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.	0
Together, we will make america strong again.	0
We will make america wealthy again.	0
We will make america proud again.	0
We will make America safe again.	0
And yes, together, we will make America great again.	0
Thank you.	0
God bless you.	0
And god bless America.	0
Thank you.	0
God bless America.	0
"Mr. President, you and the administration said to North Korea, ""Don't test a missile."""	0
They have tested a missile.	0
Is the pressure not working?	0
"Well, I didn't say, ""Don't test a missile."""	0
He's going to have to do what he has to do.	0
But he understands we're not going to be very happy.	0
And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect, the president of China, President Xi, I believe, has been putting pressure on him also.	1
But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has.	0
This was a small missile.	0
This was not a big missile.	0
This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago.	0
We'll see what happens.	0
"You say, ""Not happy."""	0
What does that mean?	0
I would not be happy.	0
If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy.	0
And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.	0
Not happy mean military action?	0
I don't know.	0
I mean, we'll see.	0
The Chinese, our allies, have been allies with North Korea.	0
How are you sure that they're not using this as a way to test you?	0
You can never be sure of anything, can you?	0
But I developed a very good relationship.	0
I don't think they want to see a destabilized North Korea.	0
I don't think they want to see it.	0
They certainly don't want to see nuclear on -- from their neighbor.	0
They haven't liked it for a long time.	0
But we'll have to see what happens.	0
The relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had.	0
But again, you know, we'll find out whether or not President Xi is able to affect change.	0
Why do--	0
I hope he is.	0
Why do these missiles keep blowing up?	0
Well, I'd rather not discuss it.	0
But perhaps they're just not very good missiles.	0
But eventually, he'll have good missiles.	0
You don't want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with it?	0
I just don't want to discuss it.	0
And I think you know me very well, where you've asked me many times over the last couple of years about military.	0
"I said, ""We shouldn't be announcing we're going into Mosul."""	0
"I said, ""We shouldn't be announcing all our moves."""	0
It is a chess game.	0
I just don't want people to know what my thinking is.	0
So eventually, he will have a better delivery system.	0
And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.	0
What do you make of the North Korean leader?	0
I have -- I really, you know, have no comment on him.	0
"People are saying, ""Is he sane?"""	0
I have no idea.	0
I can tell you this, and a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died.	0
He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others.	0
And at a very young age, he was able to assume power.	0
A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else.	0
And he was able to do it.	0
So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie.	0
But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue.	0
And frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration.	0
Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration.	0
Should've been taken care of by Clinton.	0
Let me ask you a question about the presidency.	0
George W. Bush said this about being president.	0
"He said, ""You think one thing going in, and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought."""	0
Do you agree?	0
I think I can agree with that.	0
I love doing it.	0
I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it.	0
It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge.	0
But it's something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.	0
You said in an interview with Reuters that you thought it would be easier.	0
Why?	0
Well, it's a tough job.	0
But I've had a lot of tough jobs.	0
I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years.	0
Perhaps eight years.	0
Hopefully, eight years.	0
But I'll let you know later on.	0
I think we've done very well with foreign policy.	0
I think we've done very, very well with relationships with other leaders.	0
I think we're doing great on trade deals.	0
It's set.	0
And I think we're doing well.	0
I mean, our country is being out-traded at every single point.	0
We're losing tremendous amounts of money on trade.	0
And I think actually, I've been very consistent.	0
You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media which sometimes, I must say, is you.	0
You mean me personally or?	0
Well, your show.	0
I love your show.	0
I call it Deface the Nation.	0
But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct.	0
But when they talk about currency manipulation, and I did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator, early in my tenure.	0
And then I get there.	0
Number one, they -- as soon as I got elected, they stopped.	0
They're not -- it's not going down anymore, their currency.	0
But that had been true before.	0
That had been true--	0
No.	0
--during the campaign, sir.	0
No, not true to the extent that we're talking about.	0
Much more important than that, as to when, but, you know, it did stop.	0
And I was talking about it all during the campaign.	0
And I would say that I was the one that got them to stop.	0
But forget that.	0
You were the one who got China--	0
He is working with us--	0
--to stop manipulating their currency?	0
I think so, during the campaign I talked about.	0
Even if they were doing it before?	0
No, they were doing it before.	0
I mean, there was no question.	0
I mean, they were absolute currency manipulators before.	0
"But somebody said, ""Oh, you didn't call him a currency manipulator."""	0
Now, you and I are just talking about how he's working -- I believe that President Xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem, for China also.	0
And that's North Korea.	0
"Can you imagine if I say, ""Hey, by the way, how are you doing with North Korea?"	0
"Also, we're going to announce that you're a currency manipulator tomorrow."""	0
So the mainstream media never talks about that.	0
They never say that.	0
And that's, you know, unfortunate.	0
It's just--	0
Let me--	0
--it's just one of many things, John.	0
You're a negotiator.	0
"If you need something from somebody, you need China to help you with North Korea, doesn't that send a message to China, ""We're not going to bug you about human rights, about intellectual property."	0
"In the South China Sea we're not going to put too much heat on you""?"	0
Aren't you breaking one of your own negotiating rules?	0
No.	0
I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade.	0
Trade is very important.	0
But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed?	0
That, as we would say, trumps trade.	0
Let me ask you--	0
Okay?	0
You understand what I'm saying.	0
And if I can use trade as a method to get China, because I happen to think that China does have reasonably good powers over North Korea.	0
Now, maybe not, you know, ultimate, but pretty good powers.	0
Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem--	0
Let me ask--	0
--that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States, excuse me, right?	0
What do you know now on day 100 that you wish you knew on day one of the presidency?	0
Well, one of the things that I've learned is how dishonest the media is, really.	0
I've done things that are I think very good.	0
I've set great foundations with foreign leaders.	0
We have you know -- NAFTA, as you know, I was going to terminate it, but I got a very nice call from a man I like, the president of Mexico.	0
I got a very nice call from Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada.	0
And they said please would you rather than terminating NAFTA -- I was all set to do it.	0
In fact, I was going to do it today.	0
I was going to do as we're sitting here.	0
I would've had to delay you.	0
I was going to do it today.	0
I was going to terminate NAFTA.	0
"But they called up and they said, ""Would you negotiate?"""	0
"And I said, ""Yes, I will negotiate."""	0
That's all you've learned, about the media?	0
You knew from the campaign about the media.	0
You said it all the time --	0
No, no, but the media didn't cover it that way.	0
The media said, oh, I didn't terminate NAFTA.	0
So--	0
First of all, if you look at my statements, I said--	0
No, no, I meant--	0
If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, I will terminate NAFTA.	0
Well, I'll make that statement right now.	0
Here's a question.	0
If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, we will terminate NAFTA.	0
Let's step back a minute.	0
Okay.	0
Presidents have to learn how to adapt.	0
Every president comes into the job, it's different than they expect, they must adapt.	0
Surely, you've learned something else other than that the media is dishonest.	0
No, no, I'm just saying--	0
And how do you adapt?	0
--it was one of my disappointments.	0
Give me another thing you learned that you're going to adapt and change because all presidents have to at this stage.	0
Well, I think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than you'd like them to go.	0
Why?	0
Just a system.	0
It's just a very, very bureaucratic system.	0
I think the rules in Congress and in particular the rules in the Senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving.	0
And in many cases, unfair.	0
In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make.	0
You'd make a much different kind of a deal.	0
You're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into.	0
I also learned, and this is very sad, because we have a country that we have to take care of.	0
The Democrats have been totally obstructionist.	0
Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader.	0
He's a bad leader for the country.	0
And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.	0
All they do is obstruct.	0
All they do is delay.	0
Even our Supreme Court justice, as you know, who I think is going to be outstanding, Justice Gorsuch.	0
I think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that.	0
But, you know, I still have people, I'm waiting for them to be approved.	0
Our chief trade negotiator.	0
We can't get these people through.	0
I want to get to--	0
They are obstructionists.	0
And you know what that's hurting?	0
It's hurting the country.	0
Let me ask you about health care -- Tucker Carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago when you were in the middle of health care negotiations.	0
And you agreed with him that the health care bill wasn't going to help your supporters.	0
That those who lived in rural areas, the older, were going to get hurt by that bill.	0
And you told him--	0
Excuse me, the health care bill is going to help my supporters.	0
Well, hold on.	0
Let me just finish the question, if I may, sir--	0
Otherwise, I'm not going to sign it.	0
I'm not going to do it.	0
Well, this is why I wanted to ask you.	0
"You said to Tucker, ""We will take care of our people, or I am not signing it."""	0
You said you were going to negotiate.	0
Well, that's what I just said.	0
So tell me what in the bill you've been negotiating to get--	0
But let me--	0
--in that helps your supporters.	0
I'm just trying to get the details of how your people--	0
Let me just tell you.	0
--will be helped.	0
Pre-existing conditions are in the bill.	0
"And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, ""Pre-existing is not covered."""	0
Pre-existing conditions are in the bill.	0
And I mandate it.	0
"I said, ""Has to be."""	0
So--	0
We have, we're going to have lower premiums.	0
And before you start there, let me just tell you something.	0
Obamacare is dead.	0
Obamacare right now, all the insurance companies are fleeing.	0
Places like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies.	0
They're all going.	0
Obamacare, John, is dead.	0
Okay, because we're being -- we're being compared to Obamacare.	0
Just, so.	0
Obamacare doesn't work--	0
I just want to compare you to your own.	0
One thing.	0
No, no, it's important.	0
I've got to compare it.	0
No, no, but I want--	0
But you were saying about Obamacare.	0
No, but I'm not.	0
I'm asking what--	0
With Obamacare--	0
--you're going to do.	0
--the premiums are too high.	0
The deductibles are through the roof, so you never get to use it.	0
But more importantly, it's dead.	0
So but in the bill, as it was analyzed, there were two problems.	0
One, and you talked about this with Congressman Robert Aderholt, who brought you the example of the 64-year-old who under Obamacare the premiums--	0
But that was a long time ago, John.	0
But has that been fixed?	0
Totally fixed.	0
How?	0
How?	0
We've made many changes to the bill.	0
You know, this bill is--	0
What kind though?	0
--very much different than it was three weeks ago.	0
Help us explain because there are people--	0
The bill--	0
--out there wondering what kind of changes.	0
Let me explain.	0
Let me explain it to you.	0
Okay.	0
This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay?	0
This bill has evolved.	0
And we didn't have a failure on the bill.	0
You know, it was reported like a failure.	0
Now, the one thing I wouldn't have done again is put a timeline.	0
That's why on the second iteration, I didn't put a timeline.	0
But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill.	0
We have -- we've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall.	0
We're taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can compete--	0
But that's not in--	0
--nationwide.	0
--this bill.	0
The borders are not in--	0
Of course, it's in.	0
--this bill.	0
It's in that third bill, right, because--	0
It's in the second phase.	0
Okay.	0
It's called phase one, phase two.	0
And that's, in effect, second phase, which will get approved, which will quickly get approved.	0
Let me--	0
But let me just explain something.	0
There will be such competition.	0
Right now, there's no competition.	0
There will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care.	0
So--	0
The other thing we're going to have is groups.	0
Groups of people can negotiate.	0
What's going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums.	0
In my opinion, much, much more than people understand.	0
So what you've just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldn't help your people.	0
And here's why I ask.	0
"You said, ""Pre-existing conditions."""	0
No, there were things in the other bill, the first version, which were not as good.	0
Okay.	0
But when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover pre-existing conditions, we cover it beautifully.	0
Although--	0
I'll tell you who doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.	0
Obamacare.	0
You know why?	0
It's dead.	0
In one of the fixes that was--	0
It's not going to be here.	0
In one of the fixes it was discussed pre-existing was optional for the states--	0
Sure, in one of the fixes.	0
And they're changing it--	0
--oh, okay.	0
So it'll--	0
--and changing.	0
--be permanent?	0
Of course.	0
Okay.	0
Well, that's a development, sir.	0
So you're saying it's going to be pre-existing to everybody?	0
John, this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks.	0
Now, we really have a good bill.	0
I think they could have voted on Friday.	0
"I said, ""Just relax."	0
Don't worry about this phony 100 day thing.	0
Just relax.	0
Take it easy.	0
Take your time.	0
"Get the good vote and make it perfect."""	0
Just to--	0
Most importantly, we're going to drive down premiums.	0
We're going to drive down deductibles because right now, deductibles are so high, you never -- unless you're going to die a long, hard death, you never can get to use your health care--	0
Let me ask you something--	0
--because the deductibles are so high.	0
Okay.	0
So what I hear you saying is pre-existing is going to be in there for everybody, it's not going to be up to the states?	0
Pre-existing is going to be in there and we're also--	0
And it's not up to the states?	0
--going to create pools.	0
Okay.	0
And pools are going to take care of the pre-existing.	0
But on that crucial question, it's not going to be left up to the states?	0
Everybody gets pre-existing, no matter where they live?	0
No, but the states--	0
Guaranteed?	0
--are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states.	0
Okay.	0
Is it a guarantee?	0
Look, because if you hurt your knee, honestly, I'd rather have the federal government focused on North Korea, focused on other things, than your knee, okay?	0
Or than your back, as important as your back is.	0
I would much rather see the federal government focused on other things--	0
Let me.	0
--bigger things.	0
Now, the state is going to be in a much better position to take care, because it's smaller.	0
People out there with pre-existing conditions, they are worried.	0
Are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a pre-existing condition or if they live in a state where the governor decides that's not a part of the health care, or that the prices are going to go up?	0
That's the worry.	0
The American Medical Association says--	0
We actually--	0
--it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people.	0
--we actually have, well, forget about unaffordable.	0
What's unaffordable is Obamacare, John.	0
So I'm not hearing you, Mr. President, say there's a guarantee of pre-existing conditions.	0
We actually have -- we actually have a clause that guarantees.	0
Okay, excellent.	0
We got there.	0
We have a specific clause--	0
Let me ask you--	0
--that guarantees.	0
--about your tax plan.	0
Go ahead.	0
Tax plan came out this week.	0
It's got some big deficit numbers.	0
You've said that's going to be made up by growth.	0
Congressional--	0
Well, not only growth.	0
It's going to be made up by better trade deals.	0
It's going to be made up--	0
Let me.	0
--by many different, reciprocal tax.	0
As an example, we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country, they charge us 100% tax.	0
If they make the same product and send it to us, we charge them nothing.	0
You think that's smart?	0
It's not.	0
Look--	0
We're going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries.	0
But I view that more in trade.	0
We're also going to fix all of our trade deals.	0
We're going to have a very wealthy country again.	0
Let me ask you this, Mr. President.	0
Congress may not go along with--	0
Always.	0
--so they're going to try and find some spending.	0
Let me ask you about the question of Medicare.	0
They're going to want, in Congress, to make up on the spending side, to change Medicare.	0
Will you allow that?	0
You're not going to have to do it.	0
But, sir, will you allow it?	0
You're not going to have to do it.	0
I'm just telling you we are--	0
Does President Donald Trump want them not to do that?	0
I would much prefer them not to do that, that's right.	0
It sounds as if, having covered you in the campaign, it sounds like you're leaving the door open.	0
On the campaign, you were quite clear.	0
"You said, ""I'm the guy who's not going to touch Medicare."""	0
Okay, then let me more clear.	0
I'm not going to touch it, because I said it.	0
Now, waste, fraud and abuse, I'm going to touch.	0
If there's something in Medicare that's been abused, I will touch that.	0
There are certain things, as you know, that have been absolutely abused.	0
There are certain provisions in Medicare that are horrible and abusive and there's been terrible things happening.	0
So that kind of stuff, I will absolutely touch.	0
So if I--	0
But the concept of Medicare, I'm not touching.	0
For me, if I have it now, or if I'm going to have it in the future, it's not getting cut?	0
Waste, fraud and abuse.	0
And that's it?	0
And if there are things within Medicare that are being abused, I will touch that also.	0
Other than that, it's tightened up?	0
That's right.	0
That's what it is.	0
But here's what we do.	0
We're going to grow.	0
The numbers just came out for Obama's last year.	0
1.6 GDP.	0
That means nothing.	0
That's, like, 1% GDP.	0
So I have gotten to know as you know, I really get along with a lot of other countries.	0
So I talk to the heads of countries.	0
How are you doing?	0
Not well, not well.	0
Why?	0
GDP is 8%.	0
GDP is 9%.	0
We are doing poorly.	0
GDP -- Our GDP is, like, 1%.	0
Let me ask you about your tax returns, sir.	0
"When your Treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them, Secretary Mnuchin said, ""The president has no intention."""	0
Is that right?	0
Well, I never spoke to him about it.	0
Honestly, he's never asked me about it.	0
I said, number one, I'm under audit.	0
Right now, I'm under audit.	0
After the audit is complete.	0
It's a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return.	0
You've seen the pictures.	0
My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor.	0
When you look at other people's tax return, even other wealthy people, their tax return is this big.	0
My tax return is this high.	0
I just wanted to make sure--	0
I'm under routine--	0
--you weren't changing.	0
--audit.	0
And I think it's a very unfair thing because I have been under audit almost, like, since I became famous, okay?	0
Have you--	0
Not just political.	0
I mean, I have been under audit, I'll bet you 12 or 13 or 14 years in a row.	0
Now, I have friends that are wealthy people.	0
Let me ask you--	0
They've never been audited.	0
You--	0
And I think it's very unfair.	0
You first said that you were under audit, were going to wait till that was done, about 14 months ago.	0
That seems like a long time.	0
When do you think this might happen?	0
Are you asking them?	0
It could happen soon.	0
I don't know.	0
I mean, I think--	0
When?	0
Give me a sense of--	0
--it's pretty routine, to be honest with you.	0
But then I'll make a decision.	0
A member of Congress suggested that a condition for getting tax reform would be releasing your tax returns.	0
What do you think about that?	0
Oh, I don't know who did that.	0
I mean, I don't care who did that.	0
These are the people, you know, the great obstructionists.	0
So you're not buying that deal.	0
Look where they are.	0
Look where the Democrats have ended up.	0
Hey, John, they had everything going.	0
Now they don't have the presidency, they don't have the House, they don't have the Senate, and Schumer's going around making a fool out of himself.	0
You said yesterday on Fox that Russia is a phony story.	0
Which part of it is phony?	0
The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story.	0
Meaning the Trump campaign?	0
Of course, it's a total phony story.	0
In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.	0
But you don't mean--	0
Excuse me.	0
I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015 and he was on the Obama clearance.	0
When General Flynn came to us, as you now know, he already had the highest clearance you can have.	0
I think the same clearance as the president of the United States would have.	0
He had this really high clearance.	0
And, by the way, they're so devastated because this only came up two days ago.	0
Let me ask you this, sir.	0
Why wasn't this reported months ago?	0
I--	0
But I watched one of your other competitors, and they were devastated--	0
Look--	0
--by this news, because you know what?	0
That kills them.	0
That's the end of that subject.	0
You don't think it's phony that they, the Russians, tried to meddle in the election?	0
You believe that?	0
That, I don't know.	0
I don't know.	0
That you don't know or you do know?	0
Well, I have a problem.	0
You have Podesta, who, by the way, I understand has a company with his brother in Russia.	0
Hillary's husband makes speeches in Russia.	1
Hillary did a uranium deal with Russia.	0
Nobody ever talks about that.	0
But I don't know--	0
You don't--	0
--because the FBI was not allowed by Podesta to go in and check all of the records on their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check.	0
That's number one.	0
Number two, knowing something about hacking, if you don't catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it's very hard to say who did the hacking.	0
With that being said, I'll go along with Russia.	0
Could've been China, could've been a lot of different groups.	0
So President Donald Trump is ambivalent--	0
But it could've--	0
--about or not ambivalent, you're not just not sure?	0
No.	0
We have to find out what happened.	0
I'd love to find out what happened.	0
But you don't think it's the Russians--	0
I can tell you one thing.	0
Had nothing to do with us.	0
Had nothing to do with this, and everyone knows it.	0
"And by the way, even my enemies on your show said, ""We haven't found anything that the Trump campaign did wrong."""	0
But--	0
Do you agree with that?	0
But there is agreement in the intelligence communities and other places and investigative communities on the Hill that Russia was--	0
I'm okay with it.	0
--involved in the election.	0
Honestly, John, I'm okay.	0
But why didn't Podesta and the Democrats, why didn't they allow the FBI to eject the server?	0
They hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about, to go and check their server and give the information.	0
So they were hacked.	0
Why didn't they -- the Democrats allow the FBI?	0
"They told the FBI, ""We are not going to allow you to do it."""	0
Why did they do that?	0
Why did they do that, John?	0
Why wouldn't they let the FBI go in and check?	0
And by the way, why didn't the FBI complain about it?	0
Mr. President, I think we're going to have to end it there.	0
Thank you.	0
It is 9:00 p.m. on the East Coast, 8:00 p.m. here inside the Milwaukee theater.	0
Welcome to the Republican presidential debate here on the Fox Business Network.	0
I'm Neil Cavuto, alongside my co-moderators, Maria Bartiromo, and the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal, Gerard Baker.	0
Tonight we're partnering with the Wall Street Journal to ask questions on the economy that voters want answered.	0
We're also working with Facebook, who tells us that since the first Republican debate, more than 58 million people have joined the political conversation online.	0
More than 9 million are talking specifically about the economy.	0
The candidates on stage tonight were selected based on their standing in an average of four national polls.	0
Those standings determining their position on the stage.	0
And here they are.	0
At center stage, businessman Donald Trump.	0
[ applause ]	0
Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.	0
[ applause ]	0
Florida Senator Marco Rubio.	0
[ applause ]	0
Texas Senator Ted Cruz.	0
[ applause ]	0
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.	0
[ applause ]	0
Businesswoman Carly Fiorina.	0
[ applause ]	0
Ohio Governor John Kasich.	0
[ applause ]	0
And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.	0
[ applause ]	0
Tonight's rules are simple.	0
Up to 90 second for each answer.	0
One minute for each follow-up response.	0
And if a candidate goes over their allotted time, you'll here this.	0
It sounds like a game show but it's not.	0
Now I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the elephant in the room, and I'm not talking about your party's fine symbol.	0
I'm talking about the purpose of tonight's debate.	0
The economy and what each of you would do to improve it.	0
No more, no less.	0
We are focused on those issues, and what you have said on those issues in your words and what your opponents have said in their words about your words.	0
That is the agenda tonight.	0
How each of you plans to make America better tomorrow.	0
And so we begin.	0
Candidates, as we gather tonight in this very august theater, just outside and across the country, picketers are gathering as well.	0
They're demanding an immediate hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour.	0
Just a few hours ago, near Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers, the first governor to do so.	0
Mr. Trump, as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50,000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all, are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year?	0
I can't be Neil.	0
And the and the reason I can't be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily.	0
There is nothing that we do now to win.	0
We don't win anymore.	0
Our taxes are too high.	0
I've come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much.	0
It's going to be a tremendous plan.	0
I think it'll make our country and our economy very dynamic.	0
But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world.	0
I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is.	0
People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum.	0
But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world.	0
We just can't do it.	0
So do not raise the minimum wage?	0
I would not do it.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, you have long bemoaned this lackluster recovery.	0
And this Facebook map show Americans share your concern.	0
The green represents how the jobs issue is resonating all across the nation, especially here in the state of Wisconsin.	0
You suggested one minimum wage does not fit all, and that perhaps we should offer a lower or starter wage for young people.	0
Those protesters outside are looking for $15 and nothing less.	0
Where are you?	0
Well, first of all, delighted to be here.	0
My family's here, and my little granddaughter, who's three years old, said she wanted to come to the debate.	0
So this is very cool.	0
As far as the minimum wage is concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage.	0
Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.	0
It's particularly a problem in the black community.	0
Only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one.	0
You know, that — and that's because of those high wages.	0
If you lower those wages, that comes down.	0
You know, I can remember, as a youngster — you know, my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant, and multiple other jobs.	0
But I would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money.	0
But what I did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience, and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people, and how to become a responsible individual.	0
And that's what gave me what I needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country.	0
That's what we need to be thinking about.	0
How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity, rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent?	0
[ applause ]	0
So, sir, just to be clear, you would not raise it?	0
I would not raise it.	0
I would not raise it, specifically because I'm interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, you called the recent Democratic debate in Las Vegas a night of giveaways, including free health care, free college and a host of other government-paid benefits.	0
Since you aren't a fan of all they're giving away, tell us tonight what you would take back.	0
Well, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they're related.	0
As I've said many times before, my parents were never rich people.	0
My father was a bartender.	0
My mother was a maid.	0
They worked for a living.	0
But they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren't well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves.	0
We call that the American dream, but in fact, it's a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world.	0
It is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people.	0
What makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful.	0
The problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough.	0
If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, I would be all for it, but it isn't.	0
In the 20th century, it's a disaster.	0
If you raise the minimum wage, you're going to make people more expensive than a machine.	0
And that means all this automation that's replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.	0
Here's the best way to raise wages.	0
Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training.	0
For the life of me, I don't know why we have stigmatized vocational education.	0
Welders make more money than philosophers.	0
We need more welders and less philosophers.	0
[ applause ]	0
If we do that — and if we do this — if we do this, we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.	0
Thank you, Senator Rubio.	0
[ applause ]	0
We've asked people on Facebook to submit their questions for the candidates.	0
"Seth Bell wrote, ""We are approaching $20 trillion in national debt."	0
"Specifically, what plans do you have to cut federal spending?"""	0
Governor Kasich, you have spoken much about your success in balancing the budget under President Clinton.	0
Today the national debt is at record highs and growing unsustainably.	0
Interest will be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget, tripling over the next 10 years.	0
Social Security, the lifeline of millions of American seniors, is rushing toward insolvency.	0
With all of the tax plans presented tonight, estimated to cost anywhere between $2 trillion and $12 trillion over a decade, what specific steps will you take to balance the budget?	0
First of all, let me just say that, in the state of Ohio — and I'm the only acting executive on — on this stage today — we do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage.	0
And I got to tell you, my father carried mail on his back.	0
His father was a coal miner.	0
He died of black lung.	0
He was losing his eyesight.	0
My mother's mother lived with us.	0
She could barely speak English.	0
I come from a town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work.	0
An economic theory is fine, but you know what?	0
People need help.	0
Now, I have a plan that, in fact, would cut taxes, but not $11 trillion or $12 trillion that would put my children further in debt.	0
I have a plan that would not only cut taxes, lower the income tax rate for individuals, lower the tax for businesses so businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas, and also a plan — the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term.	0
And, you know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that I call them.	0
Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side.	0
We've got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side.	0
Yes, lower taxes, lower spending.	0
My website, JohnKasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget.	0
I balanced the budget in Washington as a chief architect, and I have balanced it in Ohio for one reason.	0
When you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work.	0
And our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their God-given potential.	0
That's why it's so important.	0
And for those at the bottom, we've got to do what we can to train them so they can move up.	0
But to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of Ohio I have to deal with real challenges, and we've gotten it done in our state, and I will do it for America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Did you want to name any specific steps, sir?	0
Sure.	0
We would move the Medicare system from a 7 percent growth down to about a 5 percent growth.	0
And I have a whole series of ways to do that.	0
In Ohio, we reduced Medicaid funding for the poor from 10 percent to 2.5 percent, didn't cut one benefit or didn't take anybody off the rolls.	0
Why?	0
Because we're innovators.	0
I've been an innovator my entire career.	0
And I really don't care what special interests or lobbyists have to say.	0
I have a job to do when I take over a public office.	0
Now, we freeze non-defense discretionary for eight years.	0
We also put an increase in defense spending.	0
Our tax cuts balance out.	0
And at the end of the day, we will get to a balanced budget.	0
And I want everybody here to know, when I was Budget Committee chairman in Washington, I stepped on every toe in that town, and we got to a balanced budget, and we had enormous job growth.	0
And as governor of Ohio, we went from 350,000 lost jobs to a gain of 347,000 jobs.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
I'll do it in Washington.	0
I've done it twice; I'll do it thrice for the United States of America.	0
Senator Cruz, the International Monetary Fund recently cut its expectations for economic growth.	0
Many economists expect a recession to hit the U.S. within the next year due to the weakening of manufacturing.	0
The next president will have to deal with it.	0
You say tax reform is a powerful lever to spur economic expansion.	0
You're calling for a 10 percent income tax and a 16 percent business tax.	0
What other elements do you need in this plan to actually create jobs?	0
Well, Maria, it's great to be with you.	0
It's great to be here in Milwaukee.	0
You know, the question you asked really I think is the most important question any of us can have — face, which is, how do we get the economy growing?	0
How do we bring back economic growth?	0
Because economic growth, it's foundational to every other challenge we have.	0
As you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average.	0
The Obama economy is a disaster, and the IMF is telling us this is a new normal.	0
It doesn't have to be.	0
If you look at the history of America, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth.	0
The first is tax reform.	0
And as you noted, I have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every American that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade.	0
The second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses.	0
And the third element is sound money.	0
Every time we've pursued all three of those — whether in the 1920s with Calvin Coolidge or the 1960s with JFK or the 1980s with Ronald Reagan — the result has been incredible economic growth.	0
We have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it again.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Excuse me.	0
Governor Bush...	0
Yeah, I would like to make a comment.	0
You've already made two comments, John.	0
It's my turn.	0
We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich, coming up.	0
We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich.	0
I got about four minutes in the last debate.	0
I'm going to get my question right now.	0
I appreciate it, Jeb.	0
I'm all of you.	0
But I want at some point to talk about a value-added tax and $11 trillion, $12 trillion tax cuts that will put our kids way deeper in the hole than they have been at this point.	0
So I would like to talk about it at some point, because that's what leadership is.	0
We will — we will certainly get to that.	0
Governor Bush?	0
Yes.	0
Almost 40 percent of Americans are without a job and are not looking.	0
Many have given up.	0
That's what the participation rate tells us.	0
You've said your policies will drive the economy back to 4 percent growth, which we haven't seen since the year 2000.	0
What specific regulations would you change?	0
And how will that lead to jobs and growth?	0
First of all, we could get to 4 percent growth.	0
The new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government.	0
The reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we don't have makes — makes the deficit grow.	0
A 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform.	0
And the proposal that I've laid out is the one the Wall Street Journal editorial board has said is the most pro-growth of all the proposals out there.	0
We cut the — we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down.	0
A corporate rate of 20 percent, which puts us 5 percent above — below that of China, and allows us full expensing of investing.	0
It would create an explosion of investment back into this country, creating higher-wage jobs, and so that's part of it.	0
On the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them.	0
[ applause ]	0
And start over.	0
For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the Internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.	0
The clean power act, we ought to repeal that and — and start over on that.	0
The waters of the United States act, which is going to be devastating for agriculture and many industries, we should repeal that.	0
We should repeal the rules because the economic costs of this far exceed the social benefit.	0
And if we're serious about being serious about high growth, then we have to recognize that small businesses right now, more of them are closing than — than are — than are being set up.	0
Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama's policies get an A.	0
Really?	0
One in 10 people right now aren't working or have given up altogether, as you said.	0
That's not an A.	0
One in seven people are living in poverty.	0
That's not an A.	0
One in five children are on food stamps.	0
That is not an A.	0
It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but it's not the best America can do.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Ms. Fiorina, while you've all pointed out how weak the current recovery has been and how disappointing by any historical standards, in the general election, the Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent president's jobs performance.	0
Now, in seven years under President Obama, the U.S. has added an average of 107,000 jobs a month.	0
Under President Clinton, the economy added about 240,000 jobs a month.	0
Under George W. Bush, it was only 13,000 a month.	0
If you win the nomination, you'll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton.	0
How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans?	0
Well, first of all, I must say as I think about that question, I think about a woman I met the other day.	0
I would guess she was 40 years old.	0
She had several children.	0
And she said to me, you know, Carly, I go to bed every night afraid for my children's future.	0
And that really struck me.	0
This is America.	0
A mother is going to bed afraid for her children's future.	0
And the reason she's afraid for her children's future is because we've had problems for a long time.	0
Yes, problems have gotten much worse under Democrats.	0
But the truth is, this government has been growing bigger and bigger, more corrupt, less effective, crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time.	0
This isn't about just replacing a Democrat with a Republican now.	0
It's about actually challenging the status quo of big government.	0
Big government has created a big business called politics.	0
And there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics.	0
Specifically, we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again.	0
We need to go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent, we can challenge any dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar.	0
[ applause ]	0
We need to actually reform the tax code.	0
Go to a three-page tax code.	0
Yes, there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages.	0
In addition to rolling back what President Obama has done, we need to do a top-to-bottom review of every single regulation on the books.	0
That hasn't been done in 50 years.	0
We need to pass the REINS Act so Congress is in charge of regulation, not nameless, faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one.	0
We've become a nation of rules, not a nation of laws.	0
And finally we actually, yes, have to hold government officials accountable for their performance.	0
All this has to be done, and the citizens of this nation must help a President Fiorina get it done.	0
We must take our government back.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Paul, income inequality has been rising in the United States.	0
Fifty years ago, for example, the average CEO of a big corporation in this country earned 20 times the average salary of one of his or her workers.	0
Today, that CEO earns about 300 times the average salary of a worker.	0
Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening?	0
Absolutely.	0
And I think that we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst.	0
It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats, governors of...	1
[ applause ]	1
States run by Democrats and countries currently run by Democrats.	0
So the thing is, let's look for root causes.	0
But I would also say — lay some blame at the — the feet of the Federal Reserve.	0
I think the Federal Reserve has made this problem worse.	0
By artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money.	0
They're actually talking now about negative interest.	0
The money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in New York.	0
And because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy.	0
So what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality.	0
We also find that as the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst.	0
So really we need to reexamine whether we not — we want a Federal Reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates.	0
We also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse.	0
But the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a Republican mayor or a state with a Republican governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
All right.	0
We're only just getting started.	0
Coming up, your taxes.	0
Stick around.	0
You're watching FOX Business	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Milwaukee Theater and the Republican presidential debate.	0
Let's get right back to our questions.	0
Dr. Carson, to you.	0
You recently railed against the double- standard in the media, sir, that seems obsessed with inconsistencies and potential exaggerations in your life story, but looked the other way when it came to then-Senator Barack Obama's.	0
Still, as a candidate whose brand has always been trust, are you worried your campaign — which you've always said, sir, is bigger than you — is now being hurt by you?	0
Well, first of all, thank you not asking me what I said in the 10th grade.	0
I appreciate that.	0
[ laughter and a pplause ]	0
I'll just forget that follow-up there.	0
[ laughter ]	0
The fact of the matter is, you know, what — we should vet all candidates.	0
I have no problem with being vetted.	0
What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I don't even mind that so much, if they do it about — with everybody, like people on the other side.	0
But, you know, when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video.	1
Where I came from, they call that a lie.	0
And...	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
I think that's very different from, you know, somebody misinterpreting, when I said that I was offered a scholarship to West Point, that is the words that they used.	0
But, I've had many people come and say the same thing to me.	0
That is what people do in those situations.	0
We have to start treating people the same, and finding out what people really think and what they're made of.	0
People who know me know that I'm an honest person.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
Mr. Trump, a federal appeals court just dealt a blow to the Obama administration's plan to prevent the deportation of 5 million people living in this country illegally.	0
The White House is appealing to the Supreme Court.	0
At the heart of this issue is the effect that illegal immigrants are having on our economy, what will you do about it?	0
I was so happy yesterday when I saw that decision come down.	0
That was an unbelievable decision.	0
[ applause ]	0
And we don't have enough of those decisions coming down.	0
He of the executive order, because nobody wants to listen to him, including the Democrats, so he just goes around signing executive orders.	0
That was a great day.	0
And, frankly, we have to stop illegal immigration.	0
It's hurting us economically.	0
It's hurting us from every standpoint.	0
It's causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what that does to many of our inner cities in particular.	0
And it really is — was such an unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor.	0
And it was a 2-1 decision.	0
And it was a terrific thing that happened.	0
And I will tell you, we are a country of laws.	0
We need borders.	0
We will have a wall.	0
The wall will be built.	0
The wall will be successful.	0
And if you think walls don't work, all you have to do is ask Israel.	0
The wall works, believe me.	0
Properly done.	0
Believe me.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Can we just send 5 million people back with no effect on economy?	0
You are going to have to bring people — you are going to have to send people out.	0
Look, we're a country...	0
So what will you do?	0
Maria, we're a country of laws.	0
We either have a country or we don't have a country.	0
We are a country of laws.	0
Going to have to go out and they will come back but they are going to have to go out and hopefully they get back.	0
But we have no choice if we're going to run our country properly and if we're going to be a country.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Maria, can we comment on that?	0
Senator Rubio...	0
Can we comment on that?	0
Yes, one quick comment, yes.	0
Well, look, in 1986 Ronald Reagan basically said the people who were here, if they were law-abiding, could stay.	0
But, what didn't happen is we didn't build the walls effectively and we didn't control the border.	0
We need to.	0
We need to control our border just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house.	0
But if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are law-abiding, who are in this country, and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of Mexico — to Mexico, think about the families.	0
Think about the children.	0
So, you know what the answer really is?	0
If they have been law- abiding, they pay a penalty.	0
They get to stay.	0
We protect the wall.	0
Anybody else comes over, they go back.	0
But for the 11 million people, come on, folks.	0
We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across, back across the border.	0
It's a silly argument.	0
It is not an adult argument.	0
It makes no sense.	0
[ applause ]	0
All I can say is, you're lucky in Ohio that you struck oil.	0
That is for one thing.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him.	0
I like Ike, right?	0
The expression.	0
I like Ike.	0
Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border.	1
They came back.	0
Moved them again beyond the border, they came back.	0
Didn't like it.	0
Moved them way south.	0
They never came back.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Dwight Eisenhower.	0
You don't get nicer.	0
You don't get friendlier.	0
They moved a 1.5 million out.	0
We have no choice.	0
We have no choice.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Governor Bush...	0
Jerry, Gerald, it was an attack.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
If you're not going to have my back, I'm going to have my back.	0
A couple things here.	0
First of all...	0
Governor — Governor, you...You should let Jeb speak.	0
We have grown — we have grown...	0
No, it's unfair.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
In the state of Ohio, the state of Ohio, we have grown 347,000 jobs.	0
Our unemployment is half of what it was.	0
Our fracking industry, energy industry may have contributed 20,000, but if Mr. Trump understood that the real jobs come in the downstream, not in the upstream, but in the downstream.	0
And that's where we're going to get our jobs.	0
But Ohio is diversified.	0
And little false little things, sir, they don't really work when it comes to the truth.	0
So the fact is, all I'm suggesting, we can't ship 11 million people out of this country.	0
Children would be terrified, and it will not work.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... built an unbelievable company worth billions and billions of dollars.	0
I don't have to hear from this man, believe me.	0
I don't have to hear from him.	0
Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, you yourself — you yourself said let Governor Bush speak.	0
Governor Bush?	0
Thank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate.	0
That's really nice of you.	0
Really appreciate that.	0
[ applause ]	0
What a generous man you are.	0
Twelve million illegal immigrants, to send them back, 500,000 a month, is just not — not possible.	0
And it's not embracing American values.	0
And it would tear communities apart.	0
And it would send a signal that we're not the kind of country that I know America is.	0
And even having this conversation sends a powerful signal — they're doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this.	0
That's the problem with this.	0
We have to win the presidency.	0
And the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans.	0
Lay them out there.	0
What we need to do is allow people to earn legal status where they pay a fine, where they work, where they don't commit crimes, where they learn English, and over an extended period of time, they earn legal status.	0
That's the path — a proper path...	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Rubio?	0
Senator...	0
We have millions of people right now on line trying to come into this country.	0
Very, very unfair to the people that want to come into our country legally.	0
They've gone through the process.	0
They're on line.	0
They're waiting.	0
Very, very unfair to them.	0
That I can tell you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, Senator Rubio, let me — let me take you to a question that I think gets to the root of a lot of the anxiety that people have in this country.	0
The economy is undergoing a transformation through information technology.	0
Americans are anxious that the new economy isn't producing higher-paying jobs.	0
Many are concerned that the new wealth seems to be going mainly to innovators and investors.	0
Meanwhile, with factories run by robots and shopping done increasingly on smartphones, many traditional jobs are just going away.	0
How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines?	0
Well, you know, that's an excellent question, because what we are going through in this country is not simply an economic downturn.	0
We are living through a massive economic transformation.	0
I mean, this economy is nothing like what it was like five years ago, not to mention 15 or 20 years ago.	0
And it isn't just a different economy.	0
It's changing faster than ever.	0
You know, it took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users.	0
It took Candy Crush one year to reach some 100 million users.	0
[ laughter ]	0
So the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive.	0
Number one, we are in a global competition now, and several of the candidates have said that.	0
There are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with.	0
And we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week, because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people, but because we're not fully utilizing our energy resources, that if we did, it would bring back all kinds of growth, especially in manufacturing, and because we have an outdated higher education system.	0
Our higher education system is completely outdated.	0
It is too expensive, too hard to access, and it doesn't teach 21st century skills.	0
If we do what needs to be done — tax reform, regulatory reform, fully utilize our energy resources, repeal and replace Obamacare, and modernize higher education, then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy.	0
And we won't just save the American dream.	0
We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before.	0
And then truly this new century can be a new American century.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Cruz — Senator Cruz, entitlements.	0
You've argued for raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically.	0
When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group responded with a commercial that featured a granny being pushed off a cliff.	0
What's going to be different this time?	0
Well, my Mom is here, so I don't think we should be pushing any grannies off cliffs.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And, you miss-stated what I've said on entitlement reform.	0
What I've said is for seniors we should make no changes whatsoever, for younger workers we should gradually raise the retirement age, we should have benefits grow more slowly, and we should allow them to keep a portion of their taxes in a personal account that they control, and can pass on to their kids...	0
[ applause ]	0
...I said for future retirees was your statement...	0
[ applause ]	0
I want to go back to the discussion we had a minute ago because, you know, what was said was right.	0
The democrats are laughing — because if republicans join democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose.	0
[ applause ]	0
And, you know, I understand that when the mainstream media covers immigration, it doesn't often see it as an economic issue.	0
But, I can tell you for millions — of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue.	0
And, I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande.	0
[ audience reaction ]	0
Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press.	0
[	0
audience reaction ]	0
[ applause and c heering ]	0
Then, we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation.	0
And, I will say for those of us who believe people 'ought to come to this country legally, and we should enforce the law, we're tired of being told it's anti-immigrant.	0
It's offensive.	0
[ applause ]	0
I am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...to seek the American dream.	0
And, we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law — and I would note, try going illegally to another country.	0
Try going to China, or Japan.	0
Try going to Mexico.	0
See what they do.	0
Every sovereign nation secures its borders, and it is not compassionate to say we're not going to enforce the laws...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...And we're going to drive down the wages for millions of hardworking men and women.	0
That is abandoning the working...	0
[ applause ]	0
We go back to Facebook.	0
Dewayne Wesley Cato asks on Facebook, how do we get rid of regulations choking our businesses?	0
Ms. Fiorina?	0
Specifically, under the president's Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance, or be fined.	0
Many are opting to pay the fine.	0
Others are cutting back employee hours to duck the law altogether.	0
What specific ways will you alleviate the pressure on small business?	0
Well, first Obamacare has to be repealed because it's failing...	0
[ applause ]	0
...it's failing the very people it was intended to help, but, also, it is croney-capitalism at its worst.	0
Who helped write this bill?	0
Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, every single one of those kinds of companies are bulking up to deal with big government.	0
See, that's what happens.	0
As government gets bigger, and bigger — and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike — and business have to bulk up to deal with big government.	0
So, we have to repeal it.	0
It's tens of thousands of pages long, no one can possible understand it except the big companies, the lawyers, the accountants, the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests.	0
Then, we have to give back to states the responsibility to manage a high risk pool.	0
We need to try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried.	0
Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies.	0
We need to try the free market.	0
The free market.	0
Where people actually have to compete.	0
[ applause ]	0
And, we 'ought to have the government ensure that you must — and I don't use that term often, that government 'ought to do something, but every healthcare provider 'ought to publish its costs, its prices, its outcomes, because as patients we don't know what we're buying.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, let me just say — let me just say, I know more about innovation and entrepreneurship than anyone on this panel because I have led innovative businesses in the most highly competitive industry in the world for decades.	0
The truth is the secret sauce of America is innovation, and entrepreneurship, it is why we must cut our government down to size, and hold it accountable.	0
It's why we have to take our government back, because innovation and entrepreneurship is crushed by the crushing load of a 73,000 page tax code.	0
It is crushed...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...by regulatory thicket that is so vast we don't even know what's in it anymore.	0
It is crushed as well by government bureaucrats who don't do their jobs very well, and who are not held accountable, which is why I've said we got to take our government back, and to do that, we have to know where every dollar being spent, and be able to move any dollar.	0
We have to hack through this regulatory thicket, repeal so much, but, also, know what's in that regulatory thicket — we don't even know what regulations have been passed.	0
Third, we need to build a meritocracy — Scott Walker, by the way, is trying now to do in Wisconsin...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...Finally, we need to get to a three page tax code, and, yes, that plan exists.	0
Just to be clear, you want to repeal Obamacare...	0
[ applause ]	0
..but, what's the alternative?	0
Sorry, I can't hear you.	0
Just to be clear, you say you would repeal Obamacare...	0
...Absolutely...	0
...But, what is the alternative...	0
...You need to give...	0
...and how does that help small business...	0
The alternative is to allow states to manage high risk pools for those who really need help.	0
Look, I'm a cancer survivor, OK?	0
I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition.	1
I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help.	1
But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone.	1
We're throwing more, and more people into Medicaid, and fewer, and fewer doctors are taking those payments.	0
The point is Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help.	0
So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools.	0
Let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried, the free market.	0
Let us ensure that as patients, and customers...	0
...Thank you...	0
...that we have information to shop wisely for our health care.	0
Alright, thank you.	0
We're going to take a break here.	0
Coming up, a big issue many Americans are facing, taxes.	0
The Republican Presidential Debate continues now, live, from Milwaukee.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from Milwaukee.	0
Let's get back to the questions.	0
And we want to touch on obviously one of the biggest of this issue in this year, taxes.	0
And this will go to several of you.	0
One of the biggest economic concerns of course in the country are taxes.	0
Facebook data certainly backs that up.	0
Once again the green on this map that we're going to see here shows how the conversation around taxes is resonating across the nation, especially here in Wisconsin.	0
First off, Dr. Carson, to you.	0
You say you are in favor of a tax system, I guess akin to tithing, sir, with a flat tax rate of up to 15 percent because you said, if everybody pays this, I think God is a pretty fair guy, so tithing is a pretty fair process.	0
But Donald Trump says that is not fair.	0
That wealthier taxpayers should pay a higher rate because it's a fair thing to do.	0
So whose plan would God endorse then, Doctor?	0
[ laughter ]	0
Yours or Mr. Trump's?	0
Well, you know, when I say tithing, I'm talking about the concept of proportionality.	0
Right.	0
Everybody should pay the same proportion of what they make.	0
You make $10 billion, you pay a billion.	0
You make $10, you pay one.	0
You get same rights and privileges.	0
I don't see how anything gets a whole lot fairer than that.	0
But you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes because that is the thing that tilts it in one direction or another.	0
And you have to set the rate at an appropriate level.	0
Now I will say that, there are a lot of people who say, if you get rid of the deductions, you ruin the American dream because, you know, home mortgage deduction.	0
But the fact of the matter is, people had homes before 1913 when we introduced the federal income tax, and later after that started deductions.	0
And they say there will be no more charitable giving.	0
We had churches before that and charitable organizations before that.	0
The fact of the matter is, I believe if you put more money in people's pockets that they will actually be more generous rather than less generous.	0
And it's...	0
[ applause ]	0
... the money that they earned.	0
And, the other thing is, I do care about the poor people.	0
And in the system that we're putting together, there will be a rebate for people at the poverty level.	0
But I also want to emphasize the fact that as we get the economy moving, and I hope I get a question about how do we get the economy moving, there will be a lot more opportunities for poor people not to be poor people because this is America.	0
This is the land of dreams.	0
And our policies should be aimed at allowing people to realize that dream.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you very much.	0
Senator Paul, you said you want to blow up the tax code and start over with an across-the-board 14.5 percent fair and flat tax.	0
You happily offered that it is not revenue neutral and that's the idea.	0
You want to choke off the amount of money coming into Washington.	0
But don't you risk, sir, creating a near-term budget crisis just as your presidency would be beginning?	0
Well, it's a great question, Neil, and thanks for including me in the tax debate.	0
I think what's important about the tax debate is, is that we have to ask the question, where is money best spent, in the private sector or in the government sector?	0
I want a government really, really small, so small you can barely see it.	0
So I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
My tax plan, however, is the only tax plan among any of the candidates on the stage that is part of a balanced budget plan.	0
I put forward three plans that actually balance the budget over a five-year period.	0
Each of these plans have details on exactly where we would cut.	0
The question came up earlier, where would you cut?	0
Nobody likes to say where they would cut.	0
I've put pencil to paper and done three budgets that actually balance.	0
I'm also in favor of a plan called the penny plan where we'd just cut 1 percent across the board and the budget actually balances in less than five years.	0
So I think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget.	0
What is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax.	0
Democrats demagogue this issue to death, and when they do they say, oh, a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making $10,000.	0
That's proportionality, as Ben is trying to explain to folks.	0
But the thing is, is if we get rid of the payroll tax, everybody is going to get a tax cut.	0
And this is something that I think the public at large will support and could win an election.	0
[ applause ]	0
There are no deductions on your — under your plan?	0
Ours is 14.5 percent for corporations, 14.5 percent for individuals.	0
No payroll tax for the employee.	0
The business tax pays for social security, and there would be two remaining deductions — home mortgage and charity.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, there isn't anyone in this audience or watching at home tonight who would not like to pay less in taxes.	0
Most people just want a fair shake, and they don't want their money to be wasted.	0
But explain how your plan works.	0
How can you cut taxes as much as you propose without running up debt and deficits?	0
Well, sure, you put your finger on what the problem is.	0
The current system isn't fair.	0
Washington is fundamentally corrupt.	0
There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible — and — and not a one of them is as good.	1
[ laughter ]	0
Every one of them reflects a carve-out or a subsidy, and it's all about empowering the Washington cartel.	0
My simple Flat Tax says that, for a family of four, for the first $36,000 you earn, you pay no taxes whatsoever.	0
No income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.	0
Above that, every American pays 10 percent across the board — a flat, fair tax.	0
Which means that no longer do you have hedge-fund billionaires paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.	0
On the business side, I've got a business flat tax of 16 percent — again, that applies across the board.	0
Right now, with our corporate income tax, giant corporations with armies of accountants regularly are paying little to no taxes while small businesses are getting hammered.	0
This is fair and across-the-board.	0
Now, you ask, how do the numbers add up?	0
I would encourage folks, if you go to our website, tedcruz.org, we have the specific numbers on the website.	0
This plan eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax, eliminates the corporate income tax, and it abolishes the IRS.	0
[ applause ]	0
And the effect of that is incredible economic growth.	0
It means every income group will see double-digit increases, from the very poorest to the very weakest, of at least 14 percent.	0
So if you're a single mom, if you're making $40,000 a year, what that means is an extra about $5,000 in your pocket to provide for your kids, to make ends meet.	0
It has a powerful, powerful effect.	0
And there's one other really powerful feature of my plan, which is that it's border-adjustable.	0
Which means, if you're an exporter — if you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you're a manufacturer, you don't pay the businesses flat tax.	0
Exports are free of that tax, but all imports pay that 16 percent business flat tax, which means this tax plan would cause jobs to boom, and it would let America compete with China and the world on a level playing field.	0
[ applause ]	0
But you haven't told us how to pay for it.	0
Well, the numbers the Tax Foundation had put out is that the static cost of the plan is $3.6 trillion over 10 years, but the dynamic cost of the plan, which — which is the cost that factors in growth, is about $768 billion.	0
It is less than a trillion.	0
It costs less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth and it's one of the very few plans that abolishes the IRS.	0
But on top of that, today, we rolled out a spending plan.	0
$500 billion in specific cuts — five major agencies that I would eliminate.	0
The IRS, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and HUD — and then 25 specific programs.	0
Again, that's on our website at tedcruz.org.	0
You want to look at specificity?	0
"It's easy for everyone to say, ""cut spending""."	0
It's much harder and riskier to put out, chapter and verse, specifically the programs you would cut to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush, Republican primary voters say tax reform should be a priority for Congress and the administration.	0
But, Governor Bush, how important is tax reform in your domestic policy agenda?	0
Will you guarantee it in the first year of your presidency?	0
I'm gonna fight as hard as I can to make sure that we shift power away from Washington, simplify the tax code, to spur economic activity in this country.	0
Of course it's the highest priority.	0
"If we don't do that, we're stuck with the ""new normal"" of 2 percent growth."	0
Hillary Clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it.	0
Two percent growth means declining income for the middle class.	0
It means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated.	0
It means — it means more demands on government — growing the economy is the first job, if we're going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt.	0
And more importantly, people are really struggling right now.	0
In this economy, the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks.	0
So yeah, we've created jobs, your — argue (ph) — brought that up early, and it was a good question.	0
Jobs are being created, but they're lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost.	0
And the net effect of this is we need to jump-start the economy.	0
I think of Jonathan (ph) and Reagan Love (ph), who are supporters of mine.	0
Jonathan has been deployed by the National Guard, he is — he's in Oklahoma.	0
Reagan Love — by the way, pretty great name, I think — is a teacher.	0
When — if they had this tax cut, what they told me was that that $2,300 of money in their pocket — they would go back to South Carolina and start a business.	0
Imagine what it would be like, instead of having more businesses closed than started, we had it the exact opposite.	0
We would grow our economy, and the government would get the revenue necessary to make things — make things better.	0
Hillary Clinton's approach to this is more top-down, more regulation, more taxes, more government, and it will destroy our economy.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Rubio.	0
Can I just come to Senator Rubio?	0
We're coming to you, Mr. Trump, in one second.	0
I — I promise.	0
Yes.	0
Senator Rubio, your tax plan includes a large expansion of child tax credits to raise off (ph) the tax incomes for low-income parents.	0
A similar tax credit that you previously proposed in the Senate was estimated to cost as much as $170 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation.	0
Isn't — isn't there a risk you're just adding another expensive entitle program to an already overburdened federal budget?	0
The most important job I'm ever going to have, the most important job anyone in this room will ever have, is the job of being a parent.	0
Not the job of being president, or the job of being a senator, or the job of being a congressman.	0
The most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president (sic), because the most important institution in society is the family.	0
If the family breaks down, society breaks down.	0
You can't have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values.	0
They have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities.	0
And so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living.	0
It is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the United States, and everything costs more.	0
In 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college.	0
There are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what I'm talking about.	0
They don't know how they're going to make that payment every month, and if they can't make it, they can't work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day.	0
They don't know how they're going to save for their kids' future, to go to college.	0
And so, yes, I have a child tax credit increase, and I'm proud of it.	0
I am proud that I have a pro-family tax code, because the pro- family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the — in the country, the family.	0
Neil, there's a point I'd like to make here...	0
[ applause ]	0
....Neil, a point that I'd like to make about the tax credits.	0
We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative.	0
Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure?	0
We're not talking about giving people back their tax money.	0
He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay.	0
It's a welfare transfer payment.	0
So here's what we have.	0
Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments — a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit?	0
Add that to Marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Governor Kasich?	0
Let me come to Governor Kasich.	0
No, I'm sorry.	0
No, excuse me.	0
I was there.	0
Governor Kasich.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Very quickly, Senator.	0
Now I get my 60 seconds to respond.	0
He's talking about my tax plan.	0
Please.	0
So let me begin with this.	0
I actually believe — first of all, this is their money.	0
They do pay.	0
It is refundable, not just against the taxes they pay to the government, but also the — on their federal income tax, it's refundable against the payroll tax.	0
Everyone pays payroll tax.	0
This is their money.	0
This is not our money.	0
And here's what I don't understand — if you invest that money in a piece of equipment, if you invest that money in a business, you get to write it off your taxes.	0
But if you invest it in your children, in the future of America and strengthening your family, we're not going to recognize that in our tax code?	0
The family is the most important institution in society.	0
And, yes...	0
Nevertheless, it's not very conservative, Marco.	0
...	0
I do want to rebuild the American military.	0
How is it conservative?	0
I know that Rand is a committed isolationist.	0
I'm not.	0
I believe the world is a stronger and a better place, when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.	0
Yeah, but, Marco!	0
Marco!	0
How is it conservative, how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure for the federal government that you're not paying for?	0
Because...	0
How is it conservative?	0
...are you talking about the military, Rand?	0
How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures?	0
You can not be a conservative if you're going to keep promoting new programs that you're not going to pay for.	0
[ applause ]	0
We can't even have an economy if we're not safe.	0
There are radical jihadist in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians.	0
A radical Shia cleric in Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon, the Chinese taking over the South China Sea...	0
[ applause ]	0
...Yes, I believe the world is a safer — no, no, I don't believe, I know that the world is a safer place when America is the strongest military power in the world.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
No.	0
I don't think we're any safer — I do not think we are any safer from bankruptcy court.	0
As we go further, and further into debt, we become less, and less safe.	0
This is the most important thing we're going to talk about tonight.	0
Can you be a conservative, and be liberal on military spending?	0
Can you be for unlimited military spending, and say, Oh, I'm going to make the country safe?	0
No, we need a safe country, but, you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined?	0
I want a strong national defense, but I don't want us to be bankrupt.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...Middle ground that brings both of these together...	0
...Yes, the middle ground is this...	0
...Exactly right, that we have to defend this nation.	0
You think defending this nation is expensive, try not defending it.	0
That's a lot more expensive.	0
[ applause and cheering ]	0
But, you can do that, and pay for it.	0
You can do that, and also be fiscally responsible.	0
You know, I mention that the 25 programs that I put today, that I would eliminate them.	0
Among them are corporate welfare, like sugar subsidies.	0
Let's take that as an example.	0
Sugar subsidies.	0
Sugar farmers farm under...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...under roughly 0.2% of the farmland in America, and yet they give 40% of the lobbying money.	0
That sort of corporate welfare is why we're bankrupting our kids, and grandkids.	0
I would end those subsidies to pay for defending this nation...	0
...Gentleman, we need to move on...	0
...This is why — this is why we must combine, actually, zero-based budgeting with tax reform because unless we can examine, and cut, and move, every single dollar of discretionary spending in the federal government, we cannot reform taxes and reduce spending at the same time.	0
Ask yourself this question, how is it possible that the federal government gets more money each and every year, which the federal government has been doing, receiving more money every year for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike, and yet, never has enough money to do the important things?	0
The answer?	0
All the money's always spoken for.	0
All the money's spoken for.	0
So, we have to go to zero-based budgeting, which is a simple idea — by the way, there's been a bill for zeros-based (ph) budgeting...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...It exists, it can be voted on.	0
Every dollar must be examined.	0
Any dollar can be cut.	0
Any dollar can be cut, any dollar can be moved.	0
We have to go to a three page tax code.	0
You lower every rate, you close every loophole, why?	0
Because the government uses the tax code to decide winners, and losers.	0
You have to strip the corruption out of the tax code to pay for it.	0
You have to know where every single dollar is being spent...	0
...We need to move...	0
...Cut where you need to, and invest where you need to...	0
...We need too...	0
...The two go hand in hand...	0
...We do need to move on.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
Please, if I could just...	0
...Very quick.	0
We have to make our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before so that nobody messes with us, and a long run, it's going to save us.	0
I agree with Marco, I agree with Ted, we have no choice.	0
And, I can tell you this with certainty.	0
We all have a different tax plan.	0
Some I don't totally agree with.	0
One thing we understand, each one of those tax plans is better than the mess that we have right now.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let's talk about — No, no, Governor, I really must move on.	0
I really want to move on.	0
Mr. Trump, let's talk about the international economy...	0
...Mr. Baker, everybody got to talk about taxes...	0
...We really need to move on...	0
...I think you were coming to me and then...	0
...No, governor, I promise I will come to you...	0
...Look, I hate to crash the party to you, Mr. Baker, but, you know, what's fair...	0
...Listen...	0
...Yes, sir...	0
...Mr. Trump, can I ask you about...	0
...Yes...	0
...the U.S. just concluded an international trade agreement with 11 countries in the Pacific.	0
You've said that you'd rather have no deal...	0
...Yeah...	0
...than sign the one that's on the table...	0
...It's a horrible deal...	0
...Most economists — most economists say that trade is boosted growth, and every single post war president has supported the expansion of international trade, including the last three republican presidents.	0
Why would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy?	0
The TPP is horrible deal.	0
It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble.	0
It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.	1
It's 5,600 pages long.	0
So complex that nobodies read it.	0
It's like Obamacare; nobody ever read it.	0
They passed it; nobody read it.	0
And look at mess we have right now.	0
And it will be repealed.	0
But this is one of the worst trade deals.	0
And I would, yes, rather not have it.	0
With all of these countries, and all of the bad ones getting advantage and taking advantage of what the good ones would normally get, I'd rather make individual deals with individual countries.	0
We will do much better.	0
We lose a fortune on trade.	0
The United States loses with everybody.	0
We're losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan.	1
By the way, Mexico, $50 billion a year imbalance.	0
So I must say, Gerard, I just think it's a terrible deal.	0
I love trade.	0
I'm a free trader, 100 percent.	0
But we need smart people making the deals, and we don't have smart people making the deals.	0
The — the deal, as you say, the terms of the deal were published — were published just last week, the details, 5,000 pages of it, and 80 percent of U.S. trade with countries in the Pacific, these countries, these 11 countries, is actually tariff-free, and these — the trade deal only affects the other 20 percent.	0
Which — are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated?	0
Yes.	0
Well, the currency manipulation they don't discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster.	0
If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States — China in particular, because they're so good.	0
It's the number-one abuser of this country.	0
And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation.	0
It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement.	0
It's not even discussed.	0
There was a separate — separate...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
And as you understand, I mean, you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal, currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have.	0
They don't even discuss it in this agreement.	0
So I say, it's a very bad deal, should not be approved.	0
If it is approved, it will just be more bad trade deals, more loss of jobs for our country.	0
We are losing jobs like nobody's ever lost jobs before.	0
I want to bring jobs back into this country.	0
Hey, Gerard, you know, we might want to point out China is not part of this deal.	0
True.	0
It's true.	0
That's right.	0
That's right.	0
Before we get a little bit off-kilter here...	0
But isn't that — isn't that part of the problem?	0
When I say, Senator, that if — if this deal is not ratified by — by the U.S. — by the Senate, then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it's been seeking to do?	0
And if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead?	0
There is an argument that China doesn't like the deal, because in us doing the deal, we'll be trading with their competitors.	0
You're exactly right.	0
But I think we've sort of missed the point a little bit here.	0
There is an important point, though, about how we discuss these trade treaties that I do agree with Mr. Trump on.	0
We should negotiate from a position of strength.	0
And we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us.	0
I think it's a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals.	0
We give up the power to filibuster, and I'm kind of fond of that power.	0
[ laughter ]	0
We give up the power to amend.	0
And I think, really, one of the big problems we have in our country is, over the last century, really, so much power has gravitated to the executive branch.	0
Really, Congress is kind of a bystander.	0
We don't write the rules.	0
We don't make the laws.	0
The executive branch does.	0
So even in trade — and I am for trade — I think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Thanks, Senator.	0
Coming up, the biggest threats facing the next commander-in-chief.	0
You're watching the Republican presidential debate, live tonight from Milwaukee.	0
We'll be right back.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back.	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate.	0
The candidates taking the questions you want answered.	0
Also tonight, you can see what America is saying about the debate.	0
Go to Facebook and type #gopdebate into the search box.	0
Now, back to the questions.	0
Americans face security threats at home and abroad.	0
Last year, terrorist attacks rose 61 percent, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, with the most deaths occurring in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria.	0
Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan.	0
Do you support the president's decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?	0
Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they — that's why they're called special ops, they're actually able to guide some of the other things that we're doing there.	0
And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East.	0
This is going to be his base.	0
And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.	0
We also must recognize that it's a very complex place.	0
You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.	0
What we've been doing so far is very ineffective, but we can't give up ground right there.	0
But we have to look at this on a much more global scale.	0
We're talking about global jihadists.	0
And their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life.	0
So we have to be saying, how do we make them look like losers?	0
Because that's the way that they're able to gather a lot of influence.	0
And I think in order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate.	0
And you look for the easiest place to do that?	0
It would be in Iraq.	0
And if — outside of Anbar in Iraq, there's a big energy field.	0
Take that from them.	0
Take all of that land from them.	0
We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I've learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.	0
But you have to continue to face them, because our goal is not to contain them, but to destroy them before they destroy us.	0
[ applause ]	0
We asked Facebook to take a look at some of the major issues we're talking about, and tackling in this debate tonight.	0
This word cloud shows what people are focusing on the most.	0
The bigger the word, the more the talk.	0
One of the most discussed issues in the last month, homeland security.	0
Governor Bush, what is the biggest threat facing America today?	0
It is — I'd say it is Islamic terrorism, and, back to the question of what we are dealing with in Iraq, when we pull back voids are filled.	0
That's the lesson of history, and, sadly, this president does not believe in American leadership.	0
He does not believe it, and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and everyday to recruit Americans in our own country, and the threat to the homeland relates to the fact that we have not dealt with this threat of terror in the Middle East.	0
We should have a no fly zone in Syria.	0
We should have a support for the remnants of the Syrian Free Army, and create safe zones.	0
If you want to deal with the four million refugees that are leaving Syria because of the devastation there, then we 'ought to create safe zones for them to stay in the region rather than go to Europe.	0
And, that requires American leadership.	0
Without American leadership every other country in the neighborhood beings to change their priorities.	0
It is tragic that you see Iraq, and other countries now talking to Russia.	0
It wasn't that long ago that Russia had no influence in the region at all.	0
And, so, the United States needs to lead across the board.	0
This president, and Hillary Clinton both do not believe the United States has a leadership role to play, and we're now paying a price, and it will have a huge impact on the economy of this country if we don't deal with this.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Mr. Trump, in 2012 debate, President Obama mocked Mitt Romney's assertion that Russia was the top geopolitical challenge facing the United States, saying he was a Cold War dinosaur.	0
Now, Russia has invaded Ukraine, and has put troops in Syria.	0
You have said you will have a good relationship with Mr. Putin.	0
So, what does President Trump do in response to Russia's aggression?	0
Well, first of all, it's not only Russia.	0
We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons.	0
You know, nobody talks about it, we talk about Iran, and that's one of the worst deals ever made.	0
One of the worst contracts ever signed, ever, in anything, and it's a disgrace.	0
But, we have somebody over there, a madman, who already has nuclear weapons we don't talk about that.	0
That's a problem.	0
China is a problem, both economically in what they're doing in the South China Sea, I mean, they are becoming a very, very major force.	0
So, we have more than just Russia.	0
But, as far as the Ukraine is concerned, and you could Syria — as far as Syria, I like — if Putin wants to go in, and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes, we were stablemates, and we did very well that night.	0
But, you know that.	0
But, if Putin wants to go and knocked the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it, 100%, and I can't understand how anybody would be against it...	0
...They're not doing that...	0
...They blew up — hold it....	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...They blew up, wait a minute...	0
[ audience reaction ]	0
...They blew up a Russian airplane.	0
He cannot be in love with these people.	0
He's going in, and we can go in, and everybody should go in.	0
As far as the Ukraine is concerned, we have a group of people, and a group of countries, including Germany — tremendous economic behemoth — why are we always doing the work?	0
We are — I'm all for protecting Ukraine and working — but, we have countries that are surrounding the Ukraine that aren't doing anything.	0
"They say, ""Keep going, keep going, you dummies, keep going."	0
"Protect us..."""	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...And we have to get smart.	0
We can't continue to be the policeman of the world.	0
We are $19 trillion dollars, we have a country that's going to hell, we have an infrastructure that's falling apart.	0
Our roads, our bridges, our schools, our airports, and we have to start investing money in our country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Donald — Donald's wrong on this.	0
He is absolutely wrong on this.	0
We're not going to be the world's policeman, but we sure as heck better be the world's leader.	0
That's — there's a huge difference where, without us leading...	0

...voids are filled, and the idea that it's a good idea for Putin to be in Syria, let ISIS take out Assad, and then Putin will take out ISIS?	0
I mean, that's like a board game, that's like playing Monopoly or something.	0
That's not how the real world works.	0
We have to lead, we have to be involved.	0
We should have a no fly zone in Syria.	0
There are — they are barrel bombing the innocents in that country.	0
If you're a Christian, increasingly in Lebanon, or Iraq, or Syria, you're going to be beheaded.	0
And, if you're a moderate Islamist, you're not going to be able to survive either.	0
We have to play a role in this be able to bring the rest of the world to this issue before it's too late.	0
Assad is a bad guy, but we have no idea who the so-called rebels — I read about the rebels, nobody even knows who they are.	0
I spoke to a general two weeks ago, he said — he was very up on exactly what we're talking about.	0
"He said, ""You know, Mr. Trump?"	0
"We're giving hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to these people, we have no idea who they are."""	0
So, I don't like Assad.	0
Who's going to like Assad?	0
But, we have no idea who these people, and what they're going to be, and what they're going to represent.	0
They may be far worse than Assad.	0
Look at Libya.	0
Look at Iraq.	0
Look at the mess we have after spending $2 trillion dollars, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over the place — who I love, OK?	0
All over.	0
We have nothing.	0
And, I said, keep the oil.	0
And we should have kept the oil, believe me.	0
We should have kept the oil.	0
And, you know what?	0
We should have given the oil...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
..We should've given big chunks to the people that lost their arms, their legs, and their families, and their sons, and daughters, because right now, you know who has a lot of that oil?	0
Iran, and ISIS.	0
You know, Mr. Trump fancies himself a very good negotiator.	0
And, I accept that he's done a lot of good deals, so, Mr. Trump 'ought to know that we should not speak to people from a position of weakness.	0
Senator Paul should know that as well.	0
One of the reasons I've said that I would not be talking to Vladimir Putin right now, although I have met him as well, not in a green room for a show, but in a private meeting.	0
[ laughter, applause, and cheering ]	0
One of the reasons I've said I wouldn't be talking to Vladimir Putin right now is because we are speaking to him from a position of weakness brought on by this administration, so, I wouldn't talk to him for awhile, but, I would do this.	0
I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military — the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose.	0
I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States so that he understood we would protect our NATO allies...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...and I might also put in a few more thousand troops into Germany, not to start a war, but to make sure that Putin understand that the United States of America will stand with our allies.	0
That is why Governor Bush is correct.	0
We must have a no fly zone in Syria because Russia cannot tell the United States of America where and when to fly our planes.	0
We also have a set of allies...	0
[ applause ]	0
...We also have a set of allies in the Arab Middle East that know that ISIS is their fight.	0
They have asked us specifically over, and over again to support them.	0
King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I've known for a very long time, has asked us for bombs and material, we have not provided it.	0
The Egyptians are asking us to share intelligence, we are not, I will.	0
The Kurds have asked us to arm them for three years, we are not, I would.	0
The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Bahrain's, the Emirati, the Kurds...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...all of these, I know, by the way, understand ISIS is their fight, but they must see leadership support and resolve from the United States of America...	0
...let me follow up that...	0
...we have the strongest military on the face of the planet, and everyone has to know it.	0
Senator Paul...	0
[ applause and cheering ]	0
Senator Paul, you have already said, sir, that that would be a mistake in not talking to Vladimir Putin, or to rule it out.	0
You've argued that it's never a good idea to close down communication.	0
With that in mind, do you think the same applies to administration efforts right now to include the Iranians in talks on Syria?	0
I'd like first to respond to the acquisition, we should — I think it's particularly naive, particularly foolish to think that we're not going to talk to Russia.	0
The idea of a no fly zone, realize that this is also something that Hillary Clinton agrees with several on our side with, you're asking for a no fly zone in an area in which Russia already flies.	0
Russia flies in that zone at the invitation of Iraq.	0
I'm not saying it's a good thing, but you better know at least what we're getting into.	0
So, when you think it's going to be a good idea to have a no fly zone over Iraq, realize that means you are saying we are going to shoot down Russian planes.	0
If you're ready for that, be ready to send your sons and daughters to another war in Iraq.	0
I don't want to see that happen.	0
I think the first war in Iraq was a mistake...	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
You can be strong without being involved in every civil war around the war...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...Well, then how would you respond?	0
Ronald Reagan was strong, but Ronald Reagan didn't...	0
...Ronald Reagan walked away at Reykjavik.	0
...send troops into the Middle East...	0
...he walked away, he quit talks...	0
...Can I finish...	0
...when it was time to quit talking...	0
...Can I finish my time?	0
Could I finish with my time?	0
Why does she keep interrupting everybody?	0
[ laughter ]	0
Terrible.	0
[ booing ]	0
Yes, I would like to finish my response, basically.	0
You know, if I may respond...	0
This is an important question.	0
This is an incredibly important question.	0
And the question goes to be, who do we want to be our commander-in-chief?	0
Do you want a commander-in-chief who says something that we never did throughout the entire Cold War, to discontinue having conversations with the Russians?	0
I am not happy about them flying over there.	0
But I'm not naive enough to say, well, Iraq has them flying over their airspace, we're just going to announce that we're shooting them down?	0
That is naive to the point of being something you might hear in junior high.	0
But it's scary...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
But if you're not going to respond in a no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?	0
The first thing I would do is I wouldn't arm our enemies.	0
I wouldn't arm ISIS.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Most of the people who want to the no-fly zone also favored arming the allies of al Qaeda, which became ISIS.	0
That was the dumbest, most foolhardy notion.	0
And most of the people up here supported it.	0
They wanted to arm the allies of al Qaeda.	0
Some of them still do.	0
That's how ISIS grew.	0
We pushed back Assad, and ISIS was allowed to grow in the vacuum.	0
So the first thing you do is don't arm your enemies.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I need to add a couple of points to this.	0
The first is, I've never met Vladimir Putin, but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster.	0
He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country, controls a $2 trillion economy.	0
And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster.	0
He understands only geopolitical strength.	0
And every time he has acted anywhere in the world, whether it's in Ukraine or Georgia before that, or now in the Middle East, it's because he is trusting in weakness.	0
His calculation in the Middle East is that he has seen what this president has done, which is nothing, the president has no strategy, our allies in the region do not trust us.	0
For goodness sake, there is only one pro-American free enterprise democracy in the Middle East, it is the state of Israel.	0
And we have a president that treats the prime minister of Israel with less respect than what he gives the ayatollah in Iran.	0
And so our allies in the region don't trust us.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Vladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region.	0
And we do have a vested interest.	0
And here's why.	0
Because all those radical terrorist groups that, by the way, are not just in Syria and in Iraq, ISIS is now in Libya.	0
They are a significant presence in Libya, and in Afghanistan, and a growing presence in Pakistan.	0
Soon they will be in Turkey.	0
They will try Jordan.	0
They will try Saudi Arabia.	0
They are coming to us.	0
They recruit Americans using social media.	0
And they don't hate us simply because we support Israel.	0
They hate us because of our values.	0
They hate us because our girls go to school.	0
They hate us because women drive in the United States.	0
Either they win or we win, and we had better take this risk seriously, it is not going away on its own.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Kasich, I want to ask you about China, in particular hundreds of American companies have been subjected to cyber attacks from the Chinese military, yet state-backed Chinese companies, growing their presence in the United States, Chinese investments in U.S., which were nearly nonexistent a few years ago, are now over $50 billion.	0
And as my newspaper recently reported, Chinese companies are planning to bid for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States, what would be the largest ever Chinese takeover of a U.S. company.	0
Would you stop them?	0
Let me tell you this, Mr. Baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us.	0
I want to give you a little trip around the world.	0
I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years.	0
In the Ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves.	0
In the eastern part of Europe, make sure that Finland and the Baltics know that if the Russians move, we move.	0
In Syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the Turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the Jordanian border.	0
Anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out.	0
They fly in there a second time, they will not fly out.	0
And it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be.	0
And it also sends many messages in the Middle East that we're still involved.	0
Saudi Arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us.	0
But they're fundamentally our friends.	0
Jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years.	0
Egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the Middle East throughout their history.	0
In the groups — in the countries of the Gulf states of Bahrain, the Cleveland Clinic is opening an operation.	0
Clearly we see the same with them.	0
And in Israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them.	0
And finally China, China doesn't own the South China Sea, and I give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the Chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more.	0
And in the trade agreement, the TPP, it's critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the Chinese.	0
They are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend.	0
And finally, I will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics.	0
When the fall comes, and we run against Hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected.	0
I have two 16-year-old girls, and I want this country to be strong.	0
We make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble.	0
We must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid.	0
I served in Washington as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and we got the budget balanced.	0
And in Ohio, as the CEO, and guess what, we have got to have a CEO mentality and a way to beat Hillary Clinton and the Democracies in the fall.	0
And our ideas have to add up.	0
They have to be solid.	0
And people have to know we have the confidence to lead America.	0
And as president, I will lead this country, as I have before in Washington and in Ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs.	0
And I appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, Gerry.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Plenty of opportunities.	0
Thank you.	0
Neil?	0
All right.	0
And look at the time, look at the time.	0
You are watching FOX Business, we'll take a break.	0
Stick around.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, live from Milwaukee.	0
Now let's get straight back to the questions, and Governor Bush.	0
Governor, Hillary Clinton recently said that if we had another financial crisis like the one in 2008, she wouldn't bail out the banks.	0
Would you?	0
We're not — we shouldn't have another financial crisis.	0
What we ought to do is raise the capital requirements so banks aren't too big to fail.	0
Dodd-Frank has actually done the opposite, totally the opposite, where banks now have higher concentration of risk in assets and the capital requirements aren't high enough.	0
If we were serious about it, we would raise the capital requirements and lessen the load on the community banks and other financial institutions.	0
This vast overreach has created a huge problem for our country, and Hillary Clinton wants to double down on that.	0
I was in Washington, Iowa, about three months ago talking about how bad Washington, D.C., is.	0
It was — get the — kind of the — anyway.	0
We had...	0
[ laughter ]	0
It — and I talked to a banker there.	0
This is a bank that had $125 million of assets, four branches.	0
Their compliance costs because of Dodd-Frank went from $100,000 to $600,000 in a two-year period.	0
The net effect of that is — and they had — they had not one loan that went bad during the financial crisis.	0
They knew — they knew their borrowers.	0
They gave back to the community.	0
They were engaged in the community.	0
And imagine America without its community banks.	0
Well, that's what's happening because of Dodd-Frank.	0
That's — that's my worry.	0
My worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the Obama administration.	0
And Hillary Clinton, she wants to double down on that.	0
She wants to create even more so.	0
She is a captive of the left of her party to the point now where she is — she was for the trade agreement in — the Pacific agreement.	0
Now she's against it.	0
She was — hinted she was for the XL pipeline.	0
Now she's opposed to it.	0
All the things that would create sustained economic growth she's now doubling down against it.	0
But, Governor, but can I just quickly — did — you can't seriously guarantee that there won't be another financial crisis, can you?	0
You could, if you were serious about...	0
Ever?	0
There will never be another financial crisis?	0
No, I can't say that.	0
But I can say, if you created higher capital requirements, that's the solution to this, not having concentration of assets.	0
The bigger banks now have more and more control over — over the financial assets of this country.	0
And that is the wrong approach to take.	0
Dr. Carson, if I may, just on that point, despite measures taken, as the governor says, since the crisis to make the financial system safer, the major banks in the U.S., many of them are actually bigger than ever.	0
Asset held by JPMorgan Chase, for example, the very largest bank, have increased by nearly 40 percent to over $2.6 trillion.	0
Do you think JPMorgan and the other big banks should be broken up?	0
Well, I think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities.	0
And certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and Fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially.	0
Those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place.	0
And I think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation.	0
This country was — declared its independence in 1776.	0
In less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world.	0
And the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment.	0
Those are the fuels that drive it.	0
And what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives.	0
If we can get that out, it makes a big difference.	0
And even for the average person, every single regulation costs money.	0
And it's shifted to the individual.	0
So — and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich.	0
They go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it.	0
And the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it.	0
It is hurting the poor.	0
Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core.	0
They'll say it's the rich, take their money, but that won't help.	0
You can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having.	0
We have to come back to the fundamental principles that made America great.	0
[ applause ]	0
But just to be clear, just — just to be clear, then, you wouldn't — you wouldn't favor breaking up the big banks?	0
You think they're big enough — they're OK as they are, as big as they are?	0
I would have policies that wouldn't allow that to occur.	0
I don't want to go in and tear anybody down.	0
I mean, that doesn't help us.	0
But what does help us is stop tinkering around the edges and fix the actual problems that exist that are creating the problem in the first place.	0
Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
Can I just add what — he's right on point there.	0
Do you know why these banks are so big?	0
The government made them big.	0
The government made them big by adding thousands and thousands of pages of regulations.	0
So the big banks, they have an army of lawyers, they have an army of compliance officers.	0
They can deal with all these things.	0
The small banks, like Governor Bush was saying, they can't deal with all these regulations.	0
They can't deal with all — they cannot hire the fanciest law firm in Washington or the best lobbying firm to deal with all these regulations.	0
And so the result is, the big banks get bigger, the small banks struggle to lend or even exist, and the result is what you have today.	0
And in Dodd-Frank, you have actually codified too big to fail.	0
We have actually created a category of systemically important institutions, and these banks go around bragging about it.	0
You know what they say to people with a wink and a nod?	0
We are so big, we are so important that if we get in trouble, the government has to bail us out.	0
This is an outrage.	0
We need to repeal Dodd-Frank as soon as possible.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me — let me also say, Gary — Gary, let me also say, Jeb is — what Jeb is talking about with the big banks is to force them to reserve their capital, people who invest it and they hold their capital, so that if the bank goes down, the people who are invested in the bank are the ones that pay.	0
That's what he's trying to say.	0
Secondly, I'll tell you about Wall Street: There's too much greed.	0
And the fact is, a free enterprise system is a system that's produced the greatest wealth for the world.	0
But you know Michael Novak, the great Catholic theologian, says that a free enterprise system that is not underlaid with values — and we should all think about the way we conduct our lives — yes, free enterprise is great, profits are great, but there have to be some values that underlay it, and they need a good ethics lesson on Wall Street on a regular basis to keep them in check so we, the people, do not lose.	0
Thank you.	0
Gerard, can I comment...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Cruz — and I will get to you — but, Senator Cruz, on that theme, Facebook data shows that over the last month alone, nearly 1 million people — nearly 1 million — have been concerned about reining in Wall Street, apparently believing that some have not been punished enough.	0
So, as an accomplished litigator yourself and a former solicitor general, would you go after the very people who believe and fear that Wall Street has ignored, in other words, the crooks that Bernie Sanders say have gotten away with a financial murder?	0
Absolutely yes.	0
You know, I have spent much of my adult life enforcing the law and defending the Constitution.	0
And the problem that underlies all of this is the cronyism and corruption of Washington.	0
You know, the opening question Jerry asked, would you bail out the big banks again?	0
Nobody gave you an answer to that.	0
I'll give you an answer.	0
Absolutely not.	0
[ applause ]	0
And what we have right now is we have Washington — as government gets bigger and bigger, you know, the biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that Republicans are the party of the rich.	0
The truth is, the rich do great with big government.	0
They get in bed with big government.	0
The big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger under Dodd-Frank and community banks are going out of business.	0
And, by the way, the consequence of that is small businesses can't get business loans, and it is that fundamental corruption that is why six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington, D.C.	0
And let me give you a contrast to Washington cronyism.	0
Some weeks ago, a woman named Sabina Loving testified at a hearing that I chaired in the Senate.	0
Sabina Loving is an African-American single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of Chicago.	0
She found a store front, she wanted to have her own business.	0
She started a business.	0
But then the IRS promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers.	0
They did it under a more than 100-year-old statute called the Dead Horse Act.	0
Now, this statute and the IRS in classic Washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants, but Sabina had to pay $1,000 an employee.	0
It would have driven her out of business, and Ms. Loving sued the IRS.	0
She took the Obama IRS to court, and she won, and they struck down the rule for picking the big guys over the little guys.	0
Senator...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...Senator, I really want to be clear here.	0
Are you saying, sir, that if Bank of America were on the brink, you would let it fail?	0
Yes.	0
Now, let's be clear, there is a role for the Federal Reserve — what the Fed is doing now is it is a series of philosopher- kings trying to guess what's happening with the economy.	0
You look at the Fed, one of the reasons we had the financial crash is throughout the 2000s, we had loose money, we had an asset bubble, it drove up the price of real estate, drove up the price of commodities, and then in the third quarter of 2008, the Fed tightened the money and crashed those asset prices, which caused a cascading collapse.	0
That's why I am supporting getting back to rules-based monetary system not with a bunch of philosopher-kings deciding, but tied...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Sir, I understand that.	0
I just want to be clear, if you don't mind, that millions of depositors would be on the line with that decision.	0
And I just want to be clear.	0
If it were to happen again, for whatever the reason, you would let it go, you would let a Bank of America go?	0
So let me be clear.	0
I would not bail them out, but instead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts, what the Fed should be doing is, number one, keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold, and, number two, serving as a lender of last resort.	0
That's what central banks do.	0
So if you have a run on the bank, the Fed can serve as a lender of last resort, but it's not a bailout.	0
It is a loan at higher interest rates.	0
That's how central banks have worked.	0
And I'll point out — look, we had a gold standard under Bretton Woods, we had it for about 170 years of our nation's history, and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now.	0
We need to get back to sound money, which helps, in particular, working men and women.	0
What Washington does — the people who are doing well in the Obama economy are those with power and influence in the Obama government.	0
The people who	0
[ inaudible ]	0
working men and women...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Neil, that's the difference of being an executive.	0
And let me just explain: when a bank is ready to go under and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings, you just don't say we believe in philosophical concerns.	0
You know what an executive has to decide?	0
When there's a water crisis, how do we get water to the city?	0
When there's a school shooting, how do you get there and help heal a community?	0
When there are financial crisis, or a crisis with ebola, you got to go there and try to fix it.	0
Philosophy doesn't work when you run something.	0
And I gotta tell you, on-the-job training for president of the United States doesn't work.	0
We've done it for 8 years, — and almost 8 years now.	0
It does not work.	0
[ applause ]	0
We need an executive who's been tried, has been tested, and judge the decisions that that executive makes.	0
I don't like what the Fed is doing, but I'll tell you what worries me more than anything else: turning the Fed over to the Congress of the United States...	0
Thank you, governor.	0
So, Governor Kasich...	0
...so they can print the money.	0
That would be a very bad approach.	0
Senator Rubio.	0
...why would you then bail out rich Wall Street banks, but not Main street, not Mom and Pop, not Sabina Loving?	0
I wouldn't.	0
I wouldn't.	0
But you just said an executive...	0
No.	0
No, I didn't say that.	0
...knows to step in and bail out a bank.	0
They were — they were talking about what you would do with depositors.	0
Would you let these banks shut down?	0
My argument is, going forward, the banks have to reserve the capital, so that the — so that the people who own the capital start pressuring the banks to not take these risky approaches, Ted.	0
But at the end of the day...	0
So you said you'd abandon philosophy and abandon principle...	0
...	0
I'm gonna tell you this.	0
Let me tell you this.	0
If during — if during...	0
...but what would you do if the bank was failing?	0
...because if during — well, I'll tell you what (ph).	0
What would you do if the bank was failing?	0
I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down.	0
So you — you would bail them out.	0
As an executive — no.	0
As an executive, I would figure out how to separate those people who can afford it versus those people, or the hard-working folks who put those money in those institutions...	0
[ booing ]	0
... let me — no, no.	0
Let me say another thing.	0
Here's what I mean by that.	0
Here's what I mean by that.	0
Oh, great.	0
When you are faced — when you are faced, in the last financial crisis, with banks going under — with banks going under, and people, people who put their — their life savings in there, you got to deal with it.	0
You can't turn a blind eye to it.	0
Now, going forward, that's one thing.	0
If you had another financial crisis, perhaps there would be an effort to make sure that we do (ph).	0
Thank you, Governor Kasich.	0
Can I just — could I just say, as a chief executive who's had to make tough calls to save jobs and to grow jobs, I think what's interesting about Dodd-Frank is it's a great example of how socialism starts.	0
Socialism starts when government creates a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.	0
Government created the problem.	0
[ applause ]	0
Government created the problem of a real estate boom.	0
How did we create it?	0
"Under Republican and Democrats alike, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, everybody gathered together, Republicans and Democrats, and said, ""home ownership is part of the American dream."	0
"Let's create a bubble,"" and then government stepped in — by the way, under president George W. Bush, banks were told — encouraged — told, really — to buy other banks, to take money."	0
And now what do we have with Dodd-Frank?	0
The classic of crony capitalism.	0
The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we've created something called the Consumer Financial Production Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that's digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud.	0
This is how socialism starts, ladies and gentlemen.	0
We must take our government back.	0

More questions — more questions coming up, when the Republican presidential debate comes right back, live from Milwaukee.	0
Stay with us.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the fourth Republican presidential debate.	0
Senator Rubio, Hillary Clinton is the clear front runner for the Democratic nomination.	0
If she is indeed the nominee, you will be facing a candidate with an impressive resume.	0
She was the first lady of the United States, a U.S. senator from New York, and secretary of state under Barack Obama.	0
She has arguably more experience, certainly more time in government than almost all of you on stage tonight.	0
Why should the American people trust you to lead this country, even though she has been so much closer to the office?	0
Well, that's a great question, and let me begin by answering it.	0
[ laughter ]	0
This election is about the future, about what kind of country this nation is gonna be in the 21st century.	0
This next (ph) election is actually a generational choice.	0
A choice about what kind of nation we will be in the 21st century.	0
For over 2.5 centuries, America's been a special country, the one place on earth where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything, a nation that's been a force for good on this planet.	0
But now, a growing number of Americans feel out of place in their own country.	0
We have a society that stigmatizes those that hold cultural values that are traditional.	0
We have a society where people — millions of people — are living paycheck to paycheck.	0
They're working as hard as they ever have, but they're living paycheck to paycheck because the economy has changed underneath their feet.	0
We have young Americans who owe thousands of dollars in student loans for a degree that doesn't lead to a job.	0
For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than starting, and around the world, every day brings news of a new humiliation for America — many the direct response — direct consequence of decisions made when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of the — of state.	0
And so here's the truth: this election is about the future, and the Democratic Party, and the political left has no ideas about the future.	0
All their ideas are the same, tired ideas of the past.	0
More government, more spending.	0
For every issue for America, their answer is a new tax on someone, and a new government program.	0
This nation is going to turn the page, and that's what this election should be about, and, as I said at the first debate...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...If I am our nominee, they will be the party of the past, we will be the party of the 21st century.	0
[ cheering ]	0
And, Maria, I will note, she's got a lot of experience, but her policies have proven disastrous.	0
If you look at foreign policy, every region in the world has gotten worse.	0
Under her leadership, we abandon the nation of Israel.	0
Under her leadership, radical Islamic terrorism has been on to the rise.	0
Under her leadership, and Obama's leadership, Iran is getting $100 billion dollars, and on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon.	0
Everything she's put her hand to, or has touched — and when we talk about the cronyism of Washington, Hillary Clinton embodies the cronyism...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...of Washington.	0
And, I'll give you an example of that, which is the Congressional exemption from Obamacare, which is fundamentally wrong, and I'll tell you this, if I'm elected president, I will veto any statute that exempts members of congress.	0
The law should apply evenly to every American.	0
[ applause ]	0
OK, I think it's fair to say you're not fans of Hillary Clinton's resume.	0
Alright, Mr. Trump....	0
We are not.	0
I had a feeling.	0
Perhaps the most successful capitalist on this stage tonight, you've acknowledged that some give capitalism a bad name.	0
You've been particularly critical of businesses that find all sorts of ways of paying their taxes by keeping money abroad, but your own plan includes an incentive to bring — that more the $2 trillion dollars home.	0
Isn't that, like, a one-time bounty...	0
...No, no, no...	0
...Some of the guys you all but call pirates, so they still keep the loot, and pay only a price to bring it back.	0
Well, what's happening right now, Neil, is something that not been a subject of conversation by politicians.	0
As primarily the only politician, I guess other than Carly on the stage, they haven't talked about a corporate inversion.	0
A corporate inversion — companies are leaving.	0
You know, we used to leave New York to go to Florida.	0
We got better taxes, we got, maybe, something else.	0
Now, they're the United States to go to other countries.	0
They have trillions of dollars in those other countries.	0
They're going for two reasons, they can't get their money back in.	0
It's something where the democrats and the republicans both agree, it's the only thing I can think of.	0
They both agree, let the money come back in.	0
Three and a half years, they still can't make a deal.	0
They can't get the money in.	0
It's probably two and a half trillion, but, I think it's much more than that.	0
All of that money could become — could come right in and be used to rebuild our country, and investments in our country.	0
They can't do it.	0
What we have to do, and what I've done, is made the tax rate — and one of the reasons they don't	0
[ inaudible ]	0
the taxes so obnoxious, they can't do it.	0
Where, I made it a 10% number, as you know.	0
I've been very highly praised for it.	0
A lot of money's going to come back in, we're going to get rid of the bureaucratic problems, and roadblocks, because that's also a problem.	0
And, we're going to have all of this money pour back into the United States.	0
It's going to be used to build businesses, for jobs, and everything else.	0
And, as I say, my expression is, let's make America great again.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Paul, you were one of 15 republicans to vote for an amendment which states that human activity contributed to climate change.	0
President Obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions.	0
At the same time, energy production in America has boomed.	0
Is it possible to continue this boom, and move toward energy self-sufficiency, while at the same time pursuing a meaningful climate change program?	0
The first thing I would do as president is repeal the regulations that are hampering our energy that the President has put in place.	0
[ applause ]	0
Including the Clean Power Act.	0
While I do think that man may have a role in our climate, I think nature also has a role.	0
The planet's 4.5 billion years old, we've been through geologic age after geologic age.	0
We've had times when the temperatures been warmer, we've had times when the temperatures been colder.	0
We've had times when the carbon in the atmosphere's been higher.	0
So, I think before we — we need to look before we leap.	0
President's often fond of saying he wants a balance solution, but, really we do need to balance both keeping the environment clean, and we will have some rules for that.	0
We got to balance that with the economy.	0
He's devastated my state.	0
I say the President's not only destroying Kentucky, he's destroying the democrat party down there because nobody wants to associate with him.	0
So, what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms, and that means we will have solar, and wind, and hydro, but we will still have coal, and we still will have natural gas.	0
And, we've got to have an all of the above policy.	0
But, it would be a mistake to shut down all of our industries in the coal fields, and shut down the coal power plants.	0
If we did so we're going to have a day where we wake up and some of our big cities are either very cold, or very hot.	0
So, I think it's a big danger, and we shouldn't do it.	0
And, what we should do is say we want all of the above...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...We want to free up the energy sector, and let people produce, let them drill, let them explore.	0
Maria?	0
[ applause ]	0
Maria, critically, when it comes to climate change...	0
...We've had a 10% reduction in carbon emissions, and it isn't because of Solyndra.	0
It isn't because of the central planners in Washington D.C.	0
It's because we've had a great American success story, the explosion of natural gas.	0
Taking two existing technologies, and applying it through innovation has created lower carbon emissions, lower energy costs — 40% of all the economic activity in the age of Obama has come from the energy sector, and Hillary Clinton wants to suppress that.	0
We — I think we ought to be expanding this.	0
High growth is the path to lower carbon, and more jobs.	0
I know for a fact, as Governor of the State of Florida, we created the largest land purchasing programs, and environment clean-up programs because we had a growing economy.	0
Our revenues were growing at 4.4%.	0
It allowed for resources to be able to protect the natural system.	0
We got to get to a conservation...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...in environmental policy that goes beyond just carbon...	0
...Our — our...	0
...Alright, gentlemen, I know you want to — and I want to, be we also promised to get people home tonight, and we are going to take a quick break here.	0
I think it is fair to say at this juncture that you can discuss these issues, and only business issues, but still keep it interesting.	0
Stick around for these candidates closing statements.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate.	0
And now, candidates, it's time for your closing statements.	0
You get 30 seconds each, and, Senator Paul, we will begin with you.	0
We're the richest, freest, most humanitarian nation in the history of mankind.	0
But we also borrow a million dollars a minute.	0
And the question I have for all Americans is, think about it, can you be a fiscal conservative if you don't conserve all of the money?	0
If you're a profligate spender, you spend money in an unlimited fashion for the military, is that a conservative notion?	0
We have to be conservative with all spending, domestic spending and welfare spending.	0
I'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Kasich?	0
Well, ladies and gentlemen, if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders were to win this election, my 16-year-olds, I — I worry about what their life is going to be like.	0
You know, the conservative movement is all about opportunity.	0
It is about lower taxes.	0
It's about balanced budgets.	0
It's about less regulation.	0
And it's about sending power, money and influence back to where we live so we can run America from the bottom up.	0
In addition to that, once we have the power and the money and the influence with programs we shift out, that each of us have a responsibility to reach out and to rebuild our families, make them stronger, and connect our neighborhoods.	0
All that together — wealth, connection, family — America's greatest days are ahead.	0
We must win this election.	0
[ applause ]	0
Carly Fiorina?	0
Imagine a Clinton presidency.	0
Our military will continue to deteriorate.	0
Our veterans will not be cared for.	0
And, no, Mrs. Clinton, that situation is not exaggerated.	0
The rich will get richer.	0
The poor will get poorer.	0
The middle class will continue to get crushed.	0
And as bad as that picture is, what's even worse is that a Clinton presidency will corrode the character of this nation.	0
Why?	0
Because of the Clinton way: Say whatever you have to, lie as long as you can get away with it.	0
We must beat Hillary Clinton.	0
Carly Fiorina can beat Hillary Clinton.	0
I will beat Hillary Clinton.	0
And under a President Fiorina, we will restore the character of this nation, the security of this nation, the prosperity of this nation, because as citizens, we will take our government back.	0
[ applause ]	0
Former Governor Jeb Bush?	0
Jane Horton is sitting with my wife here today.	0
Her husband, Chris, was killed in action in Afghanistan.	0
And Jane spends her time now defending and fighting for military families.	0
They're both heroes.	0
I don't think we need an agitator-in-chief or a divider-in-chief.	0
We need a commander-in-chief that will rebuild our military and restore respect to our veterans by revamping and fixing a broken Veterans Administration, That's my pledge to you.	0
I ask for your support.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Ted Cruz?	0
Fifty-eight years ago, my father fled Cuba.	0
As he stood on the deck of that ferryboat with the wind and salt air blowing, he looked back at the oppression and torture he was escaping.	0
And yet he looked forward to the promise of America.	0
His story is our story.	0
What ties Americans together is we are all the children of those who risked everything for freedom.	0
America is in crisis now.	0
I believe in America.	0
And if we get back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that built this country, we can turn this country around.	0
I believe that 2016 will be an election like 1980, that we will win by following Reagan's admonition to paint in bold colors, not pale pastels.	0
We're building a grassroots army.	0
I ask you to join us at tedcruz.org.	0
And we, the people, can turn this nation around.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Marco Rubio?	0
Ours — the story of America is an extraordinary story.	0
It is the story of a nation that for over two centuries each generation has left the next better off than themselves.	0
But now, because Washington is out of touch, for the fault of both political parties, for the first time in our history, that is in doubt.	0
And that is what this election must be about, because if the next four years are anything like the last eight years, our children will be the first Americans ever left worse off by their parents.	0
This election is about making a different choice, about applying our principles of limited government and free enterprise to the unique issues of our time.	0
And if we do, we will not just save the American dream.	0
We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before.	0
And the 21st century can be a new American century.	0
So tonight, I ask you for your vote and I ask you to join us at my website, marcorubio.com.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
He's funny.	0
Dr. Ben Carson?	0
In the two hours of this — of this debate, five people have died from drug-related deaths, $100 million has been added to our national debt, 200 babies have been killed by abortionists, and two veterans have taken their lives out of despair.	0
This is a narrative that we can change, not we the Democrats, not we the Republicans, but we the people of America, because there is something special about this nation, and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctness.	0
[ applause ]	0
Donald Trump?	0
Thank you.	0
Over the years, I've created tens of thousands of jobs and a great company.	0
It's a company I'm very proud of.	0
Some of the most iconic assets anywhere in the world.	0
And I will tell you, I don't have to give you a website because I'm self-funding my campaign.	0
I'm putting up my own money.	0
I want to do something really special.	0
I want to make our country greater than it's ever been.	0
I think we have that potential.	0
We cannot lose this election.	0
We cannot let Hillary Clinton, who is the worst secretary of state in the history of our country, win this election.	0
We will fight.	0
We will win.	0
And we truly will make this even more special.	0
We have to make it better than ever before.	0
And I will tell you, the United States can actually be better than ever before.	0
Thank you.	0
Candidates, we want to thank you all.	0
We also appreciate your helping save time by talking over one another at times.	0
That was welcomed.	0
But by all means, it was a very riveting debate.	0
Business issues can be — can be riveting, because it wasn't about us, it's about them.	0
Thank you.	0
That'll do it.	0
Thank you for joining us.	0
Good evening.	0
From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News.	0
It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence.	0
Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.	0
The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.	0
There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.	0
Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.	0
Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.	0
By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.	0
We have an enthusiastic audience tonight.	0
They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Gentlemen, welcome.	0
It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.	0
I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.	0
Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.	0
What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?	0
Senator Kaine?	0
Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome.	0
It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.	0
This is a very special place.	0
Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School.	0
She made history by protesting school segregation.	0
She believed our nation was stronger together.	0
And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.	0
I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States.	0
I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago.	0
That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.	0
Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.	0
She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.	0
It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results.	0
And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer.	0
You've been a city councilman and mayor.	0
You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.	0
I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.	0
And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government.	0
But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible.	0
And I relish that role.	0
I'm so proud of her.	0
I'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life.	0
We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now.	0
We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.	0
Governor Pence?	0
Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family.	0
And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well.	0
And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.	0
For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened.	0
We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change.	1
And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.	0
I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket.	0
I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville.	0
I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard.	0
My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age.	0
My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana.	0
They built a family and -- and a good name and a business.	0
And they raised a family.	0
And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position.	0
So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States.	0
And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience.	0
Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy.	0
Why do so many people distrust her?	0
Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?	0
Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.	0
Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant.	0
Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?	0
And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?	0
Hillary Clinton has that passion.	0
From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids.	0
As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first.	0
And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.	0
Donald Trump always puts himself first.	0
"He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, ""off the backs of the little guy."""	0
And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.	1
It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.	0
"And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish ""me first"" style of Donald Trump."	0
"Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, ""thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."""	0
Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president.	0
Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?	0
Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign.	0
It really is remarkable.	0
At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.	0
I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.	0
The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...	0
You guys love Russia.	0
You both have said...	0
their heavy-handed approach.	0
You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.	0
Well...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment.	0
But I do want to get back to the question at...	0
But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Senator, I'll...	0
These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.	1
How can that...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Yes, and we will get to that, Senator.	0
We do have that coming up here.	0
But in the meantime, the questions...	0
Well, Senator, I must have hit a...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I must have hit a nerve here.	0
Why the disconnect?	0
Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.	0
Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times.	0
He's brought an extraordinary business acumen.	0
He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.	0
And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
And why the disconnect with your running mate?	0
But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.	0
And that's because they're paying attention.	0
I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on.	0
She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.	1
You are Donald Trump's apprentice.	0
Let me talk about this...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator, I think I'm still on my time.	0
Well, I think -- isn't this a discussion?	0
This is our open discussion.	0
Yeah, let's talk about the state of...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Well, let me interrupt -- let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can.	0
Finish your sentence.	0
The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.	0
OK, now I can weigh in.	0
Now...	0
She had a private server...	0
Now, I get to weigh in.	0
Now, let me just say this...	0
that was discovered...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.	0
keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.	0
Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault.	0
Do you?	0
Let me tell you this.	0
When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?	0
Yes.	0
Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?	0
Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?	0
Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth.	0
She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile.	0
She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.	0
Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?	0
Absolutely, without firing a shot.	0
And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.	0
Right and...	0
These are very, very good things.	0
And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...	1
Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.	0
Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...	0
No, that is incorrect.	0
That's incorrect.	0
And so we removed -- we removed all of our...	0
Gentlemen, we'll get to...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum.	0
But I'd like to correct...	0
and overrun vast areas of Iraq.	0
Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011.	0
And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops.	0
And guess what?	0
If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.	0
It was a failure of the secretary of state...	0
We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen.	0
If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's...	0
There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy.	0
Let's turn to the issue of the economy.	0
OK.	0
According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt.	0
In fact, your plans would add even more to it.	0
Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets.	0
Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.	0
Governor Pence?	0
I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.	1
I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works.	0
The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.	0
We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.	0
That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.	0
He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.	1
He left his state about $2 billion in the hole.	0
In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.	0
But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.	0
It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that.	0
You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.	0
But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.	0
But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.	0
They want to expand it into a single-payer program.	1
And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.	0
Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.	0
We can get America moving again.	0
Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth.	0
And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt.	0
When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.	0
Senator Kaine?	0
Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate.	0
"Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump?"	0
I think that's not such a hard choice.	0
"Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a ""you're hired"" plan."	0
Five components.	0
First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.	0
Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.	0
Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.	0
Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.	0
Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.	0
My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.	0
And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.	0
The Trump plan is a different plan.	0
"It's a ""you're fired"" plan."	0
And there's two key elements to it.	0
First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.	1
And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.	1
Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.	0
And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.	0
The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.	0
The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.	0
Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.	0
The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.	0
And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?	0
Because his tax plan basically helps him.	0
And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.	0
On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years.	0
Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.	0
Does that seem fair to you?	0
"Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator."	0
You use that a whole lot.	0
And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.	0
Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government.	0
And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table.	0
I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.	1
We're in the...	0
Fifteen million new jobs?	1
slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.	0
Fifteen million new jobs?	0
Governor...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side...	0
And the poverty level and the median income...	0
stepped into the Oval Office.	0
improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.	0
You -- honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different.	0
People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different.	0
I mean, this economy is struggling.	0
The answer to this economy is not more taxes.	0
But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.	0
It's not more spending...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.	0
Absolutely I will.	0
Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.	0
Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine.	0
And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician.	0
He actually built a business.	0
Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.	0
But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss.	0
We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.	0
But why won't he release his tax returns?	0
Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he...	0
I do want to come back to that, but...	0
His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used.	0
And he did it brilliantly.	0
How do you know that?	0
You haven't seen his tax returns.	0
He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.	0
How do you know that?	0
And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs.	0
And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes...	0
Elaine, let me talk about something.	0
Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.	0
OK.	0
The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.	0
"Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, ""If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes."""	0
He's broken his first...	0
And he will.	0
He's broken his first promise.	0
Second, he stood on the stage...	0
He hasn't broken his promise.	0
He said he's...	0
"He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, ""That makes me smart."""	0
So it's smart not to pay for our military?	0
It's smart not to pay for veterans?	0
It's smart not to pay for teachers?	0
And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid.	0
And the last thing I'll say is this...	0
Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?	0
The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is...	0
I do.	0
Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president.	0
Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president.	0
And he's breaking his promise.	0
Elaine, I have to respond to this.	0
You get very little time, 20 seconds.	0
I'll be -- I'll be very respectful.	0
Governor?	0
Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.	0
But he said he would release his tax returns.	0
All right, Gentlemen...	0
The American people can review that.	0
And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over...	0
I need to ask you about Social Security...	0
Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.	1
They're going to raise your taxes.	0
We're going to cut your taxes.	0
Gentlemen...	0
If you can't meet Nixon's standard...	0
The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other.	0
I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.	0
All right.	0
We're having fun up here.	0
Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76.	0
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year.	0
What would your administration do to prevent this cut?	0
First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done.	0
It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty.	0
And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty.	0
We have to keep it solvent.	0
And we will keep it solvent.	0
And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.	0
Here's what Hillary and I will not do.	0
And I want to make this very plain.	0
We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.	0
Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.	1
And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security.	0
Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it.	0
We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security.	0
And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.	0
Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond.	0
Well, thanks, Elaine.	0
There they go again.	0
OK...	0
Go read -- go read the book.	0
All Donald Trump -- all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors.	0
That's it.	0
Go read the book.	0
We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare.	0
That's what this campaign is really about, Senator.	0
And I get, this is -- this is the old scare tactic that they roll out...	0
But -- but you have a voting record, Governor.	0
And I get all of that.	0
I just, look...	0
I...	0
There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.	0
I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record.	0
I have to go back to.	0
We...	0
Well, look, I -- you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security.	0
Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes.	0
We're going to -- we're going to -- we're going to...	0
You're not going to cut taxes.	0
You're going to raise taxes on the middle class.	0
reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.	0
All right.	0
Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a -- in a mountain range of debt.	0
And we're going to face hard choices and...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Gentleman, I want to move on now.	0
You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.	0
All right.	0
Let me move on now...	0
Three hundred and five (ph) economists said your plan is bad for the economy.	0
to the issue of law enforcement and race relations.	0
Law enforcement and race relations.	0
"After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, ""We're asking cops to do too much in this country."	0
Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve.	0
"Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops."""	0
Do we ask too much of police officers in this country?	0
And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns?	0
Senator Kaine?	0
Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment.	0
I think we put a lot on police shoulders.	0
And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.	0
I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.	0
And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States.	0
We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.	0
And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too.	0
And we did something we had really wanted to do.	0
For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.	0
Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.	0
The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.	0
You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows.	0
And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.	0
That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.	0
Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.	0
That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.	0
So here's what we'll do.	0
We'll focus on community policing.	0
We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.	0
I'm a gun-owner.	0
I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.	0
But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.	0
And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.	0
One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu.	0
He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor.	0
He had survived the Holocaust.	0
Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country.	0
But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence.	0
We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.	0
Governor Pence?	0
You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago.	0
He was my hero when I was growing up.	0
And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago.	0
My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side.	0
Police officers are the best of us.	0
And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day.	0
And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea.	0
It's worked in the Hoosier state.	0
And we fully support that.	0
Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.	0
It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them.	0
They see his commitment to law and order.	0
But they also -- they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism.	0
And that really has got to stop.	0
I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy.	0
I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn.	0
We -- we grieve with those who grieve.	0
And we're saddened at the loss of life.	0
But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States.	0
I just think...	0
Can I -- can I explain...	0
I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy.	0
We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action.	0
But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.	0
Elaine -- Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement.	0
And if you're afraid to have...	0
I'm not afraid to bring that up.	0
And if -- if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it.	0
And so here's -- here's an example, heartbreaking.	0
We would agree this was a heartbreaking example.	0
The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school.	0
And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.	0
But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a -- they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked.	0
The kids loved him.	0
But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident.	1
And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.	1
We need criminal justice reform.	0
Well, we do.	0
Indiana has passed criminal justice reform.	0
But I just want to say, those who say that we should not...	0
But that's not what you're talking about.	0
we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem...	0
Governor Pence...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Governor Pence...	0
Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?	0
Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Governor Pence, I have a question on that point.	0
I did not make that statement.	0
I...	0
Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor.	0
He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year.	0
A U.S. senator.	0
"He said, ""I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself."""	0
What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences?	0
Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend.	0
And what I would say is that we -- we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally.	0
I -- I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it.	0
I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act.	0
We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice.	0
But what -- what -- what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement.	0
We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...	0
Elaine, can I...	0
So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor?	0
Law enforcement in this country is a force for good.	0
They are the -- they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day.	0
But I would -- I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement.	0
You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk.	0
Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime...	0
Elaine, let me -- let me...	0
Governor, the question is about Senator Scott.	0
What would -- what would you tell Senator Scott?	0
Elaine, if I could -- if I could jump in.	0
I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea.	0
And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law.	0
So there is a fundamental respect issue here.	0
And I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top.	0
Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals.	0
He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.	0
I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother.	0
He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican.	0
He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured.	0
He said African-Americans are living in Hell.	0
And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen.	0
If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about.	0
And I just -- again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.	0
All right.	0
I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration.	0
Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported.	0
What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes?	0
Governor Pence?	0
Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country.	0
We've been talking it to death for 20 years.	0
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.	1
But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement.	0
It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.	0
And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas.	0
And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain.	0
But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago.	0
These were Donald's -- hold on a second, Governor.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
It's my time, Senator.	0
It is, in fact, the governor's time.	0
I apologize.	0
It's your two minutes.	0
I apologize.	0
Thanks.	0
I forgive you.	0
He says ours is an insult-driven campaign.	0
Did you all just hear that?	0
Ours is an insult-driven campaign?	0
I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables.	0
It's -- she said they were irredeemable, they were not American.	0
I mean, it's extraordinary.	0
"And then she labeled one after another ""ism"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all."	0
So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean...	0
Governor...	0
That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton...	0
Senator Kaine?	0
calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.	0
Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that.	0
She said she shouldn't have said half.	0
Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please.	0
Yeah, that's right, so now we're even.	0
Yeah.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero...	0
Oh...	0
to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.	0
"She apologized for saying ""half."""	0
Governor.	0
It is his two minutes, please.	0
Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight?	0
Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell?	0
Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States?	0
You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.	0
Immigration.	0
There's two plans on the table.	0
Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform.	0
Donald Trump believes in deportation nation.	0
You've got to pick your choice.	0
Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.	0
That's our proposal.	0
Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents.	0
And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship.	0
So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that.	0
That's another 4.5 million people.	0
These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force.	0
They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.	0
And I cannot believe...	0
That's nonsense.	0
That's nonsense.	0
I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone.	0
Senator, we have a deportation force.	0
It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.	0
And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.	0
So you like the 16 million deportations?	0
Senator, that's -- that's nonsense.	0
Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty.	0
That's...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986.	0
They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill.	0
We all know the routine.	0
It's amnesty.	0
And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.	0
That's how Washington always plays it.	0
No, I...	0
They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.	0
Governor, Mr. Trump has said...	0
Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation.	0
Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.	0
So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave?	0
Would they be forcibly removed?	0
Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security.	0
It begins with border security.	0
And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement.	0
But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens.	0
We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement.	0
We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities.	0
The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity.	0
And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.	0
Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas.	0
We're going to enforce the law of this country.	0
We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that.	0
And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have...	0
I just have to correct Governor Pence....	0
where people can come into this country.	0
I have to...	0
That's the order that you should do it.	0
Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system.	0
I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in.	0
But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said.	0
When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody.	0
"He said, quote, ""They will all be gone."""	0
They will all be gone.	0
And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said.	0
And to add...	0
He's talking about criminal aliens.	0
And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants.	0
Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families.	0
Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger.	0
When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that.	0
Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism.	0
Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago?	0
Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased?	0
Senator Kaine?	0
The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead.	0
The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped.	0
The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world.	0
There's only 15,000.	0
But there are other parts of the world that are challenging.	0
Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton.	0
Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11.	0
She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors.	0
That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism.	0
And she's got a plan to do it.	0
She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden.	0
Here's her plan to defeat ISIL.	0
First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield.	0
She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.	0
Second, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens.	0
But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence.	0
That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it.	0
Donald Trump.	0
Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot.	0
Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.	0
"He said, I have a secret plan,"" and then he said, Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL."	0
"And then he said, ""I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan."""	0
"And finally he said, ""I'm going to fire all the generals."""	0
He doesn't have a plan.	0
But he does have dangerous ideas.	0
Here's four.	0
He trash talks the military.	1
The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them.	1
He wants to tear up alliances.	0
"NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay ""big league."""	0
Third, he loves dictators.	0
He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...	0
Oh, please.	0
Come on.	0
and Saddam Hussein.	0
And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.	0
He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them.	0
"And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: ""Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves."""	0
I'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.	0
Governor Pence?	0
Did you work on that one a long time?	0
Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.	0
Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it.	0
Well, look, I can defend -- I -- I -- I can -- I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States.	0
It's absolutely inarguable.	0
We've weakened America's place in the world.	0
It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership.	0
I mean, I will give you -- and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11.	0
I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.	0
I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I know you were.	0
We all lived through that day as a nation.	0
It was heartbreaking.	0
And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice.	0
But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida.	0
Our primary threat today is ISIS.	0
And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.	0
My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl.	0
Scott Zubowski.	0
He fell in Fallujah in 2005.	0
He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation.	0
And that nation was secured in 2009.	0
But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war.	0
The president just ordered more troops on the ground.	0
We are back at war in Iraq.	0
And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.	0
And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.	0
Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?	0
You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program.	1
Yes, we did.	0
You essentially...	0
Even the Israeli military says it stopped.	0
guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off.	0
Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism.	0
But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey.	0
Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents.	0
What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?	0
Well, I think it's -- I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first.	0
I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life.	0
But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism.	0
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...	1
(CROSSTALK)	0
Elaine, I want to...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Governor, the question was about homegrown.	0
Yeah, and so -- but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program...	0
Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous.	0
That's not -- that's absolutely false.	0
That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine.	0
The Seventh Circuit...	0
We have different views on -- on refugee issues and on immigration.	0
Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous?	0
These guys say all Mexicans are bad.	0
That's absolutely false.	0
And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous.	0
Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim.	0
Mike Pence...	0
Absolutely...	0
put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria.	0
And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...	0
Right.	0
Right.	0
and said it was discriminatory...	0
And those judges -- those judges said...	0
We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination.	0
Governor?	0
Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that -- that ISIS had infiltrated the United States.	0
Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.	0
But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game.	0
I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state.	0
But, Governor Pence...	0
So you bet I suspended that program.	0
But, Governor Pence, I just...	0
And I stand by that decision.	0
And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.	0
Sure.	0
Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not.	0
We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.	0
But the problem with that...	0
That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.	1
Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in.	0
So -- the FBI...	0
When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in.	0
The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain.	0
You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator.	0
I understand the...	0
By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?	0
the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program...	0
Senator Kaine, let me ask you this.	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.	0
has talked about an intelligence surge.	0
Yes.	0
What exactly would an intelligence surge look like?	0
And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?	0
Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine.	0
It's two things.	0
It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies.	0
So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.	0
But the second piece of this is really, really important.	0
It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies.	0
And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next.	0
Alliances are critical.	0
That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.	0
That's not his plan.	0
Well, he said NATO is obsolete.	0
And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with?	0
Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances.	0
She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.	0
And that's what an intelligence surge means.	0
Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.	0
All right.	0
I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria.	0
Two hundred fifty thousand...	0
Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?	0
You can -- you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.	0
First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week.	0
We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country.	0
And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.	0
We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.	0
We have an intelligence, sir (ph).	0
But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it...	0
And I don't -- 30 seconds is on up.	0
about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.	0
Right.	0
Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I'd like to ask you about Syria, Governor.	0
We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step.	0
You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this.	0
We have a justice system that does that.	0
And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that...	0
All right, we are moving on now.	0
Two hundred fifty thousand people...	0
If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did...	0
one hundred thousand of them children -- Governor...	0
they'd be court martialed.	0
That is absolutely false and you know that.	0
Absolutely true.	0
And you know that, Governor.	0
Governor...	0
It's absolutely true.	0
Gentlemen, please.	0
Because the FBI did an investigation.	0
Gentlemen.	0
And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further.	0
Sorry.	0
Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.	0
Syria.	0
I want to turn now to Syria.	0
Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria.	0
Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries.	0
Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?	0
The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo.	0
Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset.	0
After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.	0
And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America -- the greatest nation on Earth -- just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins -- look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.	0
It begins by rebuilding our military.	0
And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military.	0
We have the smallest Navy since 1916.	0
We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War.	0
We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.	0
But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.	0
And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength.	0
And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.	0
There's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well.	0
We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.	0
Governor, your two minutes are up.	0
We've just got to have American strength on the world stage.	0
When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president.	0
Senator Kaine?	0
Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea.	0
And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not.	0
Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin.	0
And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.	0
The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces.	0
Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.	0
Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground.	0
He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists.	0
If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.	0
I'll tell you what offends me...	0
Well, that offended me.	0
Governor Pence just said -- Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military.	0
No, he won't.	0
Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes.	0
The New York Times story -- and we need to get this -- but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995.	0
Those years included the years of 9/11.	0
So get this.	0
On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States.	0
Young men and women -- young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism.	0
Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight.	0
It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror.	0
The question was about Aleppo, Senator.	0
He wouldn't support troops.	0
He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine.	0
When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important.	0
Right.	0
And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria.	0
It's very important.	0
Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone.	0
Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically?	0
How would you keep it safe?	0
Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops.	0
Donald Trump supports our veterans.	0
He won't pay taxes.	0
Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions?	0
How does that work?	0
Gentlemen, this is about Syria.	0
I'd like to...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Honestly, Senator.	0
Honestly, Senator.	0
It is about our troops.	0
It is about our troops.	0
I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject.	0
How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?	0
I understand why you want to change the subject.	0
And let me be very clear on this Russian thing.	0
The larger question here...	0
Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?	0
Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here.	0
What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates.	0
And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East.	0
And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore.	0
To answer your question, we just need American strength.	0
We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way.	0
And exactly how would those safe zones work?	0
How would they remain safe?	0
The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community.	0
The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone.	0
But, look, this is very tough stuff.	0
I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade.	0
I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years.	0
I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.	0
And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...	0
Well, let me -- let me come back...	0
is deeply troubling to me.	0
That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.	0
and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine.	0
He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.	0
He doesn't want to acknowledge...	0
We didn't.	0
that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden.	0
He doesn't want to acknowledge...	0
I just did.	0
that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000.	0
But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous.	0
Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea.	0
Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s.	0
He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event.	0
And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.	0
And come on.	0
Senator.	0
Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton.	0
And that -- that's pretty low.	0
But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?	0
Senator, the...	0
That's what Donald Trump thinks.	0
Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won.	0
And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence...	0
But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?	0
and assurance to our allies.	0
But let me go back to this Iran thing.	0
I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.	0
Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks.	0
Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it.	0
You wouldn't necessarily know that.	0
Go to the tape.	0
I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress.	0
No, I visited him in his office.	0
I visited him in his office.	0
You boycotted the speech.	0
The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran.	0
And then Hillary used them to get a deal.	0
We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions.	0
Elaine, let me just mention one thing.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence.	0
They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions.	0
And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons.	0
That...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
And very quickly, Senator.	0
Elaine...	0
and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment...	0
We need to talk about Russia.	0
Very quickly, though, Senator, please.	0
is astonishing to the American people.	0
Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next.	0
And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate.	0
Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth.	0
All right.	0
He's going...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.	0
And I just think that should be underlined.	0
No, I'm -- look...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia.	0
This is a topic that has come up.	0
I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump.	0
If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time.	0
I will give you an opportunity to do that.	0
More nations should get nuclear weapons.	1
Try to defend that.	0
Don't put words in my mouth.	0
Well, he never said that, Senator.	1
He absolutely said it.	0
Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.	0
Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said.	0
Gentlemen, Russia.	0
Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime.	0
What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions?	0
Senator Kaine?	0
You've got to be tough on Russia.	0
So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.	0
Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader.	0
And Donald Trump has business...	0
No, we haven't.	0
has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose.	0
Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia.	0
She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.	0
She's had the experience doing it.	0
She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.	0
And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.	0
Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.	0
Oh, that's nonsense.	0
"He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, ""I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine."""	0
And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.	0
He knew that.	0
Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START.	0
She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program.	0
And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia.	0
You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does.	0
On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time.	0
America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason.	0
They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?	0
Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do.	0
And I know he's laughing at this, but every president...	0
But what's it got to do with Russia?	0
Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia.	0
The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest...	0
No, he hasn't said that.	0
He has, actually.	0
Senator, your time is up.	0
Governor?	0
Well, thanks.	0
I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table.	0
You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate.	0
Yeah.	0
And I know you can't defend.	0
Senator, please.	0
This is the governor's two minutes.	0
I'm happy to defend him, Senator.	0
Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him.	0
You're not.	0
I'm happy to defend him.	0
Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that.	0
I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend...	0
This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.	0
Senator, please.	0
This is Governor Pence's two minutes.	0
Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality.	0
Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia.	0
That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula.	0
Donald Trump knew that happened.	0
He basically was saying it's not going to happen again.	0
The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.	0
And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding.	0
You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo.	0
ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa.	0
It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure.	0
I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...	0
We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.	0
on the day that Iran released four American hostages...	0
We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.	0
Governor...	0
we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.	1
(CROSSTALK)	0
Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said...	0
And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.	0
"quote, ""Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama."""	0
Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration?	0
Strength.	0
Plain and simple.	0
Business dealings.	0
Donald Trump -- that's nonsense.	0
Donald Trump is a strong leader...	0
Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization...	0
who is going to lead with American strength.	0
Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond.	0
We're going to rebuild our military.	0
And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing.	0
Look, America is stronger than Russia.	0
Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy.	0
America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way.	0
When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts.	0
That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin.	0
That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...	0
Senator Kaine?	0
of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.	0
Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it.	0
But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.	0
That is absolutely inaccurate.	0
And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises...	0
He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage.	0
No, he said leader.	0
And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor.	0
You just said better.	0
If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground...	0
Yeah, here we go.	0
This is the grade school thing again?	0
persecuting journalists...	0
Right, this is grade school.	0
if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief.	0
Yeah.	0
And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia.	0
Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them.	0
Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line.	0
Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?	0
Vladimir Putin.	0
Vladimir Putin is a dictator.	0
And what would do you differently?	0
Vladimir Putin is a dictator.	0
He's not a leader.	0
Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin.	0
Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is.	0
John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB.	0
And Hillary kind of has that same feeling.	0
Right.	0
So how do deal with him?	0
You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways.	0
There are areas where we can cooperate.	0
So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile.	0
It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.	0
She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy.	0
But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals.	0
This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.	0
All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons.	0
North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.	0
Right.	0
What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States?	0
Governor Pence?	0
Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces.	0
And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions.	0
It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.	0
And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power.	0
We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.	0
But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up.	0
It must have -- must have...	0
Until he...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
done well in some focus group.	0
But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation.	0
While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors.	0
Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff.	0
Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process.	0
They cannot make financial contributions.	0
But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars.	0
And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.	0
When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason...	0
Governor, your two minutes are up.	0
the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...	0
Governor, please.	0
while she's secretary of state.	0
Your two minutes are up, Governor.	0
And they're saying enough is enough.	0
Senator Kaine?	0
I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea.	0
So, on the foundation.	0
I am glad to talk about the foundation.	0
The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world.	0
It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.	1
It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses.	0
It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does.	0
The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.	0
Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation.	0
The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States.	0
So the foundation does good work.	0
And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.	0
But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation.	0
The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns.	0
He's refused to do it.	0
His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia.	0
And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit.	0
It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.	0
The Trump Foundation is non-profit.	0
In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation.	0
The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.	0
They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.	0
And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.	0
This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.	0
Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Well, Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation.	0
They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.	0
Political contributions?	0
Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.	0
A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?	1
Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.	1
Ninety percent.	0
It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff.	0
But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails...	0
All right, let's turn back to North Korea...	0
that she refused to turn over in her private server...	0
Senator Kaine...	0
and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.	0
Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?	0
If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat.	0
You have to.	0
A president has to do that.	0
Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.	0
You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.	0
I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.	0
We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.	0
And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package.	0
Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.	0
They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.	0
So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.	0
So we're working together with China, and we need to.	0
China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.	0
Hillary understands that very well.	0
"She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, ""Women's rights are human rights."""	0
They didn't want her to say that, but she did.	0
But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China.	0
And that's what it's going to take.	0
The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China.	0
I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.	0
All right.	0
I'd like to turn to our next segment now.	0
And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues.	0
You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives.	0
Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position?	0
Senator Kaine?	0
Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine.	0
It's an easy one.	0
I'm really fortunate.	0
I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents.	0
My mom and dad are sitting right here.	0
I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City.	0
My 40th reunion is in 10 days.	0
And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life.	0
I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.	0
But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.	0
For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.	0
But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.	0
And so I had to grapple with that.	0
When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty.	0
But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion.	0
I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law.	0
And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.	0
And I was elected, and I did.	0
It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.	0
That was a real struggle.	0
But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.	0
Governor Pence?	0
Well, it's a wonderful question.	0
And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.	0
I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.	0
It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.	0
But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.	0
And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.	0
And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.	0
And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith.	0
I truly do.	0
That's shared.	0
But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.	0
The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives.	0
I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.	0
I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.	0
But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.	0
I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.	0
And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.	0
Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.	0
But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.	0
So for me, my faith informs my life.	0
I try and spend a little time on my knees every day.	0
But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.	0
Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question.	0
Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.	0
But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.	0
But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.	0
So let's talk about abortion and choice.	0
Let's talk about them.	0
We support Roe v. Wade.	0
We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy.	0
That's something we trust American women to do that.	0
And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.	0
Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.	0
He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.	0
And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.	0
This is pretty important.	0
Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.	0
I think you should live your moral values.	0
But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices.	0
And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.	1
No, it's really not.	0
Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.	0
Then why did Donald Trump say that?	0
We just never would.	0
Why did he say that?	0
Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.	0
And so...	0
Well, I would admit that's not a polished...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.	0
Well, can I say...	0
But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.	0
Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew.	0
From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.	0
Yeah.	0
When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals...	0
I'm telling you...	0
or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.	0
Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again.	0
He -- look...	0
Can you defend it?	0
There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.	0
You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?	0
He also said and many of them are good people.	0
You keep leaving that out of your quote.	0
And if you want me to go there, I'll go there.	0
But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life.	0
I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life.	0
It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace.	0
And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view.	0
People need to understand, we can come together as a nation.	0
We can create a culture of life.	0
More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it.	0
We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...	0
This is important --	0
bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world.	0
There are so many families around the country who can't have children.	0
We could improve adoption...	0
But, Governor...	0
so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.	0
Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?	0
We can encourage people to support life.	0
Of course we can.	0
But why don't you trust women?	0
Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?	0
That's what we ought to be doing in public life.	0
Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...	0
Because there are...	0
but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions.	0
Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.	0
I believe it with all my heart.	0
And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.	0
I do have one final question for you both tonight.	0
It has been a divisive campaign.	0
Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?	0
That's a really important one.	0
That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign.	0
And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next.	0
But we do have to bring the country together.	0
So here's what we'll do.	0
Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state.	0
And I served in the Senate.	0
And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.	0
She was on the Armed Services Committee.	0
She was on other committees.	0
She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.	1
She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon.	0
She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.	0
She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen.	0
And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record.	0
I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses.	0
And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.	0
Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together.	0
And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.	0
Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?	0
Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion...	0
Absolutely.	0
tonight.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation.	0
Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat.	0
I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.	0
You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States.	0
And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill.	0
The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it.	0
The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again.	0
They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again.	0
They want to see an American comeback.	0
And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building.	0
It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America.	0
When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller.	0
They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it.	0
And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long.	0
All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.	0
This concludes the vice presidential debate.	0
My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching.	0
Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.	0
From Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News.	0
Good night.	0
Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?	1
I think something's happening.	0
Something's changing and it'll change back again.	0
I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference.	1
But I don't know that it's manmade.	1
I will say this.	0
I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars.	0
I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs.	0
I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage.	0
I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels.	0
And you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man.	0
You don't know.	0
Well, your scientists, your scientists--	0
No, we have--	0
At NOAA and NASA--	0
We have scientists that disagree with that.	0
"You know, I was thinking what if he said, ""No, I've seen the hurricane situations, I've changed my mind. There really is climate change."""	0
"And I thought, ""Wow, what an impact."""	0
Well-- I'm not denying.	0
What an impact that would make.	0
I'm not denying climate change.	0
But it could very well go back.	0
You know, we're talkin' about over a millions--	0
But that's denying it.	0
--of years.	0
They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael.	0
Who says that?	0
They say?	0
People say.	0
People say that in the--	0
Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?	0
You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley.	0
I can't bring them in.	0
Look, scientists also have a political agenda.	0
Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist--	0
Yes.	0
Yes.	0
--the Saudi journalist, was he murdered by the Saudis?	0
And did the prince give the order to kill him?	0
Nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out.	0
It's being investigated.	0
It's being looked at very, very strongly.	0
And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case.	0
As of this moment, they deny it.	0
And den-- deny it vehemently.	0
Could it be them?	0
Yes.	0
Jared, your son-in-law.	0
Got on the phone and asked the prince.	0
Did he deny it?	0
Did he--	0
They deny it.	0
They deny it every way you can imagine.	0
In the not-too-distant future, I think we'll know an answer.	0
What are you options?	0
Let's say they did.	0
What are your options?	0
Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?	0
Well, it depends on what the sanction is.	0
I'll give ya an example.	0
They are ordering military equipment.	0
Everybody in the world wanted that order.	0
Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it.	0
We got it.	0
So would you cut that off--	0
I tell you what I don't wanna do.	0
Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com-- I don't wanna hurt jobs.	0
I don't wanna lose an order like that.	0
There are other ways of-- punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true.	0
Tell everybody what's at stake here.	0
You know---	0
Well, there's a lot at stake.	0
There's a lot at stake.	0
And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter.	0
There's something-- you'll be surprised to hear me say that.	0
There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case.	0
So we're gonna have to see.	0
We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.	0
You've had a string of wins lately.	0
Let's see, the economy, the d-- the trade deal-	0
Right.	0
With Canada and Mexico, Kavanaugh--	0
And South Korea.	0
And South Korea.	0
And Kavanaugh, the confirmation.	0
There has been no administration in the history of our country, and I say this openly and proudly, that in its first two years--	1
Say, this is modesty.	0
Well, it's not even that, it's a fact Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history.	0
What about North Korea?	0
Talking about accom--	0
Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement.	0
Look, we--	0
"You say ""so far""?"	0
It's always so far, til everything's done.	0
I-- I-- you know, deals are deals, okay?	0
Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter.	0
But I will say this.	0
The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea.	0
I sat with President Obama--	0
We were goin' to war?	0
--and-- we were gonna--I think it was going to end up in war.	0
And my impression is-- and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get.	0
Doesn't get any tougher than that.	0
Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough.	0
We were going to war with North Korea.	0
Now, you don't hear that.	0
You don't hear any talk of it.	0
And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it.	0
And you see that, he's agreed to it.	0
No missiles.	0
Do you trust him?	0
I do trust him, yeah, I trust him.	0
That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong --	0
Why would--	0
about it?	0
you trust him?	0
Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you.	0
Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes--	0
Well, remember what Reagan said.	0
Trust, but verify.	0
Sure.	0
I know.	0
It's-- it's very true.	0
But the fact is, I do trust him.	0
But we'll see what happens.	0
But is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles-	0
They want to--	0
With nuclear--	0
And I will tell you that they're closing up sites.	0
But--	0
Setting it up.	0
Is what I said true, that they haven't?	0
Gotten--	0
Well, nobody really knows.	0
I mean, people are saying that.	0
I've actually said that.	0
What?	0
That they're still building missiles, more missiles?	0
We don't really know, Lesley.	0
We really don't know.	0
But I assume--	0
Suspect that?	0
Let's say the answer is yes, okay?	0
In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile.	0
They haven't tested a rocket.	0
They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast.	0
It sort of moves the earth.	0
And we have a relationship now.	0
One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions.	0
We haven't done that.	0
Are you prepared to do that?	0
What-- what does he have to do--	0
No, no.	0
I--	0
Before you're--	0
No I'm not doing it.	0
This isn't the Obama administration.	0
I haven't eased the sanctions.	0
I haven't done anything.	0
I haven't done anything.	0
We're meeting.	0
I believe he likes me.	0
I like him.	0
We have a good relationship.	0
It's very important.	0
I wanna read you his resume, okay?	0
He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation-- reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions.	0
This is a guy you love?	0
Sure.	0
I know all these things.	0
I mean-- I'm not a baby.	0
I know these things.	0
I know, but why do you love that guy?	0
Look, look.	0
I-- I-- I like-- I get along with him, okay?	0
But you love him.	0
Okay.	0
That's just a figure of speech.	0
No, it's like an embrace.	0
It well, let it be an embrace.	0
Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.	0
He's a bad guy.	0
Look.	0
Let it be whatever it is.	0
I get along with him really well.	0
I have a good energy with him.	0
I have a good chemistry with him.	0
Look at the horrible threats that were made.	0
No more threats.	0
No more threats.	0
China.	0
I get along with him.	0
It's very important.	0
China, let's go.	0
I'm skipping across the world here.	0
You've slapped a lot of tariffs--	0
$250 billion.	0
Gonna do more?	0
Might.	0
Might.	0
Round three?	0
They wanna negotiate, Lesley.	0
They wanna negotiate.	0
Are you ready?	0
Look.	0
Are you ready to--	0
I have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China.	0
I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue.	0
I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.	1
And how-- how--	0
And I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore.	0
How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?	0
Okay.	0
Okay.	0
So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case.	0
Some--	0
--if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%.	0
But they've--	0
--again.	0
--retaliated.	0
That's what I'm asking.	0
They can retaliate, but they can't-- they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate.	0
We do $100 billion with them.	0
They do $531 billion with us.	0
Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?	0
No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929.	0
Well that's what I'm asking.	0
I don't want that.	0
No, I don't want that.	0
I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us.	0
I want them to open their markets like our-- our markets are open.	0
But you're in a--	0
And it will be a fair deal--	0
--trade war right now.	0
Trade war.	0
You call it war, I don't call--	0
You-- you--	0
--it--	0
--you did today.	0
I called it a skirmish.	0
I heard you, you called it a war.	0
I called it, actually I called it a battle.	0
But, actually, I'm gonna lower that.	0
I consider it a skirmish.	0
And we're gonna win.	0
You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.	0
I mean, what's an ally?	0
We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people.	0
But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union.	0
The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done.	0
But this is hostile.	0
And yet, they-- it's not hostile.	0
It sounds hostile.	0
You know what's hostile?	0
The way they treat us.	0
We're not hostile.	0
No, but can't you deal with--	0
We've been-- we've been--	0
--them without--	0
--the stupid country for so many years.	0
Are you willing to get rid of that Western alliance?	0
Now, I like NATO, NATO's fine.	0
But you know what?	0
We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe.	1
And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade.	0
They're not going to do it anymore.	0
They understand that.	0
Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance?	0
It's been going for 70 years.	0
It's kept the peace for 70 years.	0
You don't know that.	0
You don't know that.	0
I don't know what?	0
You don't know that.	0
"Is it true General Mattis said to you, ""The reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War III?"""	0
No, it's not true.	0
What's not true?	0
Frankly, I like General Mattis.	0
I think I know more about it than he does.	0
And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you.	0
I'm gonna try one more time.	0
Okay.	0
I know-- and, Lesley, you don't have to try again.	0
I know exactly what you're saying--	0
Well, answer my question.	0
The answer is this.	0
I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way.	0
I'm fully in favor of NATO, but I don't wanna be taken advantage of.	0
Putin.	0
Yeah.	0
Okay, people don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin.	0
Okay, you ready?	0
I don't understand it.	0
I have been-- you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference--	0
No, I mean publicly.	0
You never say anything harsh about him--	0
Excuse me.	0
--publicly.	0
I didn't?	0
I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.	1
Obama didn't.	0
You know what he sent?	0
He sent pillows and blankets.	0
I'm the one-- and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this--	0
Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin--	0
I think I'm very tough with him personally.	0
I had a meeting with him.	0
The two of us.	0
It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.	0
Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?	0
In poisonings?	0
Probably he is, yeah.	0
Probably.	0
I mean, I don't--	0
Probably?	0
But I rely on them, it's not in our country.	0
Why not-- they shouldn't do it.	0
This is a terrible thing.	0
Of course they shouldn't do it-	0
Instead do you believe--	0
That's your (Inaudible.)--	0
--do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election?	0
Our election-	0
They-- they meddled.	0
But I think China meddled too.	0
But why do you--	0
And I think other countries--	0
--say China meddled too?	0
And you wanna know something?	0
Why do you say Chi-- why don't you just say--	0
Well, let me ask you--	0
--the Russians meddled?	0
Because I think China meddled also.	0
And I think, frankly, China--	0
This is amazing.	0
--is a bigger problem.	0
You are diverting the whole Russia thing.	0
I'm not doing anything.	0
You are, you are	0
I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China.	0
What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?	0
Well, we'll see what happens come midterms.	0
But--	0
But everybody thinks, given the things you've said--	0
I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that.	0
I was very disappointed.	0
Why should he have recused himself?	0
So I was very--	0
So--	0
--disappointed but--	0
So can I assume--	0
--we'll see what happens.	0
Can I assume he's gone?	0
No.	0
No.	0
You can't assume that.	0
Will you.	0
Will you pledge-- pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?	0
Well, I-- I don't pledge anything.	0
But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that.	0
I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.	0
But you won't pledge--	0
There is no collusion.	0
I don't wanna pledge.	0
Why should I pledge to you?	0
If I pledge, I'll pledge.	0
I don't have to pledge to you.	0
But I have-	0
Well--	0
I have no intention of doing that.	0
Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election?	1
Give me a break.	0
They wouldn't be able to help me at all.	1
Call Russia.	0
It's so ridiculous.	0
So you've been president for almost two years.	0
Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done?	0
Do you have any regrets?	0
So when I won the presidency, I th-- I-- I-- the press treats me terribly.	0
I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great.	0
Lesley, they treat me worse.	0
They got worse instead of better.	0
Very dishonest.	0
Okay, this-- you're-- but you regret?	0
I regret that the press treats me so badly--	0
I'm-- I'm really asking (Inaudible.)--	0
And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so.	0
Have you made any mistakes?	0
That's my question.	0
Everybody makes mistakes.	0
And what have been yours?	0
I could have been-- earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal.	0
The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders.	0
I was getting to know countries.	0
I didn't wanna do it right outta the box.	0
So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier.	0
What about the forced separation of children from their-- migrant children--	1
Yeah.	0
Well, that was--	0
from the--	0
the same as the Obama law.	1
You know, Obama had the same thing.	1
It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it.	0
You--enforced it.	0
You launched that-- the zero tolerance policy-- to deter families with children coming--	0
No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation.	0
And frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country.	0
So are you gonna go back to that?	0
Well, we're looking at a lot of things.	0
Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were-- they were a laughing stock all over the world.	0
Are you willing though-- I think that you're saying you're-- it's under consideration.	0
No, I want all the laws changed.	0
But the children specifically--	0
there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally.	0
And part of the r-- I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States.	0
Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no.	0
Go ahead.	0
Are you willing to reinstitute that policy?	0
"You said, ""We're looking at everything."""	0
I will--	0
Yes or no.	0
I will only-- I can't-- you can't say yes or no.	0
What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.	0
I'm not gonna ask it again--	0
You don't have to.	0
cause I know you won't-- it--	0
But it's the same as Obama.	0
Okay.	0
Changing subjects again-- you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military.	0
You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?	0
Okay.	0
So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah.	0
Now I say they're babies.	0
Who's the toughest?	0
They're babies, the political people.	0
This is the most deceptive, vicious world.	0
It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception.	0
You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with-- that table.	0
Give me an example.	0
Well, I don't wanna give you an example.	0
I'm not lookin' to-- in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do.	0
Remember that.	0
When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at-- making deals with other countries.	0
Nobody's been able to do anything like this.	0
Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it.	0
But it's a very deceptive world.	0
The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was.	0
I-- I-- and I really mean it.	0
I'm not saying that as a sound bite.	0
I never--	0
I'd like to--	0
Knew how dishonest--	0
I'm-- I'm gonna change the subject again.	0
Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation.	0
When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it.	0
No, I'm gonna run your--	0
When I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it.	0
I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so.	0
I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.	0
I disagree, but I don't wanna have that fight with you.	0
Hey, it's okay--	0
All right, I'll get in another fight with you--	0
Lesley, it's okay.	0
In the meantime, I'm president--and you're not.	0
This country is divided, polarized.	0
Within families, there aren't even people who can talk to each other.	0
What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and--	0
Yeah-- I think that--	0
--anger?	0
--what's going to happen-- I think the economy's bringing people together.	0
It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama.	0
I can see the country uniting.	0
I can see it.	0
We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh-- you-- know what I'm saying.	0
But when you won that.	0
--during the hearings for the Supreme Court, we had senators that behaved horribly.	0
But when you won, you won.	0
No-- no one is gonna argue with that.	0
I won--	0
You won.	0
"And then after you won, instead of saying, ""Oh, let's all come together, this is wonderful."	0
"Let's heal all of this,"" you come out and bash the Democrats."	0
Well, I bashed their attitude.	0
I bashed their statements--	0
But why not try to--	0
Because they were--	0
--bring us together?	0
--so unfair to Judge Kavanaugh.	0
I've never--	0
But why not--	0
seen anything like it.	0
--why not try and-- we need to be healed.	0
We need--	0
I don't think they want to heal yet, I'll be honest.	0
Well, you don't wanna--	0
I think--	0
heal yet.	0
I-- I-- I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement.	0
I don't think they wanna be healed.	0
I do wanna heal.	0
I'm n-- I'm not talking about Democrat-- I'm talking about the country.	0
You go out and you go to Mississippi.	0
The famous Mississippi speech?	0
And you mimicked Professor Blasey Ford.	0
You mimicked her.	0
Had I not made that speech, we would not have won.	0
I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything.	0
No (Inaudible.)--	0
And you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary.	0
Why did you have to make fun of her?	0
I didn't really make fun of her.	0
Well, they were laughing.	0
What I said the person that we're talking about didn't know the year, the time, the place.	0
Professor Blasey Ford got before the Senate and-- and was asked what's the worst moment.	0
"And she said, ""When the two boys laughed at me, at my expense."""	0
Ok, fine.	0
And then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her.	0
They can do what they-- I-- I will tell you this.	0
The way now Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms.	0
Have you seen what's gone on with the polls?	0
But did you have to--	0
Well, I think she was treated with great respect, I'll-- I'll--	0
And-- but--	0
be honest with you.	0
but do you think—you treated her with--	0
There are those that think she shouldn't have--	0
Do you think you treated her with respect?	0
I think so, yeah.	0
I did.	0
But you seem to be saying that she lied.	0
W-- you know what?	0
I'm not gonna get into it because we won.	0
It doesn't matter.	0
We won.	0
"The anonymous column that ran in ""The New York Times."""	0
The author, we don't know who it is.	0
Whoever it is.	0
Whoever it is.	0
"Maybe it was ""The New York Times"" too."	0
Paints a picture.	0
"No, no, it's --By the way, you don't know how dishonest ""The New York Times"" is."	0
"It could've been ""The New York Times."""	0
I doubt it.	0
But it could've been.	0
Okay.	0
I doubt it too.	0
It also could've been any-- w-- well, don't count on it.	0
It also could've been any one of 3,000 people.	0
You have said that this administration is like a smooth-running machine.	0
And yet, we keep hearing that the White House is in chaos.	0
It's-- wrong, it's so false.	0
It's fake news.	0
I'm changing things around.	0
And I'm entitled to.	0
I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal.	0
They'll come into the administration, they'll be phenomenal.	0
More people gonna go?	0
Yeah, other people will go, sure.	0
Cause so many people, you have kind of a record of --on turnover.	0
I think I have a great Cabinet.	0
There're some people that I'm not happy with.	0
Who are you not happy with?	0
No, I don't wanna say that but	0
Come on.	0
Not I don't want to say that.	0
What about General Mattis?	0
Is he going to leave?	0
Well, I don't know.	0
He hasn't told me that.	0
I have--	0
Do you want him to--	0
--a very good relationship with him.	0
It could be that he is.	0
I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth.	0
But General Mattis is a good guy.	0
We get along very well.	0
He may leave.	0
I mean, at some point, everybody leaves.	0
Everybody.	0
People leave.	0
That's Washington.	0
The first lady, Melania.	0
She said that there are still people in the White House that she doesn't trust and that you shouldn't trust.	0
I feel the same way.	0
I don't trust everybody in the White House, I'll be honest with you.	0
"You go to a meeting, do you have to wonder, ""Is he wearing a wire--"""	0
I'm usually --	0
–or whatever?	0
Not so much a wire.	0
I'm usually guarded.	0
And I think I'm guarded anyway.	0
But I'm not saying I trust everybody in the White House.	0
I'm not a baby.	0
It's a tough business.	0
This is a r-- this is a vicious place.	0
Washington DC is a vicious, vicious place.	0
The attacks, the-- the bad mouthing, the speaking behind your back.	0
--but-- you know, and in my way, I feel very comfortable here.	0
It takes a president a while to find his sea legs.	0
I think so.	0
I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United States, but I think that's true with everybody.	0
POTUS.	0
Now I very much feel like POTUS.	0
I do.	0
I feel like the president.	0
"You know, for a little while, it's like-- ""Mr. President, sir."""	0
It's-- even my friends, they call me, they-- they don't call me Donald-- they call me Mr. President.	0
"And I say, ""Will you please loosen up?"""	0
I've learned on the job.	0
I have.	0
And you feel comfortable?	0
I feel very comfortable, yeah.	0
Caution, you are about to enter the No Spin Zone, THE FACTOR begins right now.	0
Hi, I am Bill O'Reilly.	0
Thanks for watching us tonight.	0
As you may know, my interview with President Trump making headlines all over the world.	0
And tonight, we will show you what you did not see in the Super Bowl pregame show.	0
Here is what happened.	0
We interviewed the President on Friday afternoon, at the White House.	0
The interview ran about 40 minutes.	0
Ten of which were used by FOX Sports.	0
So, that leaves us with half an hour.	0
To show you tonight and tomorrow.	0
The headlines out of the Super Bowl interview where Mr. Trump comments on the Russian and Putin and the anti-ObamaCare roll-up.	0
It's interesting to watch our two competing cable news stations, which hate, hate Mr. Trump to an unhealthy degree.	0
Try to analyze what the President told me.	0
I thought Donald Trump was straightforward and honest in that interview, whether you like his answers or not.	0
But the Trump haters were trying desperately to find something with which to hammer the President.	0
Also apparently the Putin administration in Moscow demanding that I, your humble correspondent, apologized for saying old blood is a killer.	0
So, I am working on that apology, but it may take a little time.	0
Might want to check in with me around 2023.	0
In a conference call with reporters, Putin's press guy said this.	0

[Via Translator]	0
We think words like that coming from the FOX correspondent are unacceptable, offensive, and to be honest, we would prefer to get an apology to the President coming from such a respected company.	0
[End Video Clip]	0
Anyway, tonight, we have a number of subjects that we presented to President Trump.	0
Here they are.	0
[Begin Video Clip]	0
Let's talk about Iran, your assessment, do you think we are on a collision course we being the United States with that country?	0
I think it was the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated.	0
I think it was deal that should have never been negotiated.	0
The nuclear deal?	0
Absolutely.	0
The deal that was made by the Obama administration, I think it's a shame that we've had a deal like that and that we had to sign a deal like that and there was no reason to do it.	0
And if you're going to do it have a good deal.	0
Secretary Kerry who was negotiating it never once left the table.	0
We have the worst of everything.	0
We've already given them billions and billions, probably hundred $50 billion.	0
We gave them $1.7 billion in cash, which is unheard of.	1
And we put the money out.	0
And we have really nothing to show for it.	0
Possibly you'll tear it up?	0
We will see what happens.	0
And we'll going to see what happens.	0
I can say this, they had total disregard for our country.	0
They are the number one terrorist state, they're sending money all over the place and weapons, and can't do that.	0
Sanctions, that's how you're going to start with them?	0
Just started.	0
But you're going to move in a carrier, right?	0
Well, we're just started with sanctions.	0
I never talked about military moves.	0
I always criticize President Obama with having an announcement that they're going into Mosul, they're going to some place.	0
And they give the name, the date, the time.	0
I don't believe in that.	0
We will -- let's see what happens.	0
But I don't like to talk about what we do militarily.	0
So, you're not real bullish on Iran at this point.	0
No, I'm not bullish.	0
It's like they're emboldened.	0
They follow our planes, they circle our ships with their little boats, and they scream things at us.	0
It is what happened -- it's not good.	0
You would thought what the deal they made, which was a great deal for them and a horrible deal for us, that they would have had a warmth toward our country, and it's exactly the opposite.	0
They lost respect because they can't believe anybody could be so stupid as to make a deal like that.	0
Let's talk about Mexico.	0
There was a report that you talk to President Nieto, and you told him that this was the report.	0
I want to know if it's true or not.	0
That if his arm he couldn't handle the drug cartels, that U.S. army soldiers would.	0
Did you say that?	0
We have to do something about the cartels, I did talk to him about it.	0
I want to help him with it.	0
I think he is a very good man.	0
We have a very good relationship, as you probably know.	0
We will going to have a wall, we will going to have a border.	0
We have to stop drugs from coming into our country, and if he can handle it, and maybe they can and maybe they can't or maybe he needs help, he seemed very willing to get help from us because he has got a problem and it's a real problem for us.	0
So, President Nieto of Mexico was open to the possibility of U.S. forces, all right?	0
Helping him combat the drug cartels.	0
I would rather, as a very nice man that he is and somebody I respect, I would rather have him respond to that.	0
But I will tell you, I certainly offered him help on knocking out the drug cartels because we have got a problem.	0
Don't forget those cartels are operating in our country, and they are poisoning the youth of our country.	0
And by the way, countries all over the work, just so you understand, this is a cartel all over the world, the cartels.	0
But I certainly would help him if he needed the help here	0
At this point, do you consider Mexico a corrupt country?	0
Because this stuff has been going on for decades.	0
His Mexico corrupt.	0
Well, it's a country that has got difficulty.	0
It's certainly has done well with us.	0
We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $60 billion a year.	0
That doesn't include drugs, and it doesn't include the border and all the things that are happening on the border.	0
But it is a country that I have great respect for the people.	0
I love the people.	0
I really like this administration.	0
I think he is a good man.	0
We get along very well.	0
But they have problems controlling aspects of their country.	0
There is no question about it.	0
And I would say that drugs and the drug cartels number one.	0
Have you figured out what kind of a tariff you're going to levy on Mexico to pay for the wall?	0
Well, we might not have to do that.	0
They want to negotiate a deal.	0
I want to negotiate a deal.	0
We will see what happens.	0
But we can always do a tariff or a tax if necessary, and we will do that if necessary.	0
But if we can make a deal, we assignment of NAFTA, but I am going to put another F in the name NAFTA because right now it's free trade, and I'm going to have it fair trade also because it's not fair.	0
All right.	0
So --	0
We are losing, Bill.	0
We are losing $60 billion a year in trade deficits with Mexico.	0
We can't do that.	0
You talked to Putin last week.	0
You had a busy week last week.	0
I had a busy week.	0
Yes.	0
Busy week and a half.	0
But within 24 hours of you on the phone with the Russian leader, the pro-Russian forces step up the violence in Ukraine.	0
Yes.	0
Did you take that as an insult?	0
No I didn't because we don't really know exactly what that is.	0
They're pro-forces.	0
We don't know if they're uncontrollable?	0
Are they uncontrollable?	0
That happens also.	0
We're going to find out.	0
I will be surprised, but we will see.	0
Do you respect Putin?	0
I do respect him.	0
Do you?	0
Why?	0
Well, I respect a lot of people.	0
But that doesn't mean I am going to get along with him.	0
He's a leader of his country.	0
I say it's better to get along with Russia than not.	0
Will I get along with them?	0
I have no idea.	0
He is a killer though.	0
Put is a killer.	0
There are a lot of killers.	0
Do you think our country is so innocent?	0
Do you think our country is so innocent?	0
I don't know of any government leaders that are killers in America.	0
Take a look at what we have done too.	0
We've made a lot of mistakes.	0
I've been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.	1
Yes.	0
Mistakes are different then --	0
A lot of mistakes, okay?	0
But a lot of people were killed.	0
So, a lot of killers around, believe me.	0
All right.	0
You mentioned ISIS.	0
Can we expect, we the American people, more U.S. military action against ISIS?	0
You know, I hate to be evasive but --	0
You know, tell me specifically.	0
I don't like talking openly about it.	0
I don't like talking openly about it.	0
I can say this, ISIS is bad.	0
They are evil.	0
They cut off heads of Christians and Muslims and anybody else that gets in their way.	0
They drown people in steel cages.	0
This is like not since the medieval times has anything happened like this.	0
And the previous administration allowed it to happen because we shouldn't have been in Iraq, but we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.	0
It created a vacuum, ISIS was formed.	0
I was to take the oil.	0
If they would've taken the oil, there would be no ISIS because they used that to --	0
If you took the oil, the Iraqi oil, you would have to put in U.S. troops to do that, and then that would have started another round of it.	0
And you would have made a lot of money with the oil and you would have had assets and to the -- and all of that.	0
But forget that.	0
Okay.	0
Let's turn to domestic policy.	0
When can Americans expect the tax cuts?	0
This year?	0
Yes.	0
We are working very much right now on the health care package.	0
Which I think would be -- it is moving along very well.	0
We are trying to get our person Dr. Tom price approved, as you know, the Democrats are being purely political reasons.	0
Yes.	0
That is terrible.	0
But let me get you on the record here.	0
2017, can Americans expect a tax cut?	0
I think so, yes.	0
And I think before the end of the year, I would like to say yes.	0
Okay.	0
Can Americans in 2017 expect a new health care plan ruled out by the Trump administration?	0
This year.	0
Well, in the process, and maybe it will take until sometime into next year, but we are certainly going to be in the process.	0
Very complicated.	0
ObamaCare is a disaster.	1
You have to remember, ObamaCare doesn't work.	1
You look at Arizona, 160 percent increase.	0
You look at Minnesota, all of these places it's going through the roof.	0
It's done.	0
It doesn't work.	0
But when are you going to have something ready?	0
We're going to be putting it in very soon.	0
I think that yes, I would like to say by the end of the year.	0
At least the rudiments, but we should have something within a year into the following year.	0
And by the way, we will have something that is good.	0
Less expensive and really great health care.	0
[End Video Clip]	0
Next on the rundown, part two of the Trump interview, we focus on immigration, Kate's Law, and Mr. Trump's relationship with President Obama.	0
Coming right back.	0
[End Part 1]	0
[Begin Part 2]	0
Continuing now with our lead story, an interview with President Trump at the White House last Friday.	0
As stated the talk is making headlines all over the world.	0
Here is part two.	0
[Begin Video Clip]	0
Now, this is a fascinating story.	0
I just spent the week in California, as you know.	0
They are now voting on whether they should become a sanctuary state.	0
So, the state of California, led by Governor Jerry Brown is defying you, absolutely defying the President of the United States.	0
So, California and the USA are on a collision course.	0
How do you see it?	0
Well, I think it is a ridiculous sanctuary cities as you know.	0
I am very much opposed to sanctuary cities.	0
They break crime, there are lots of problems.	0
You do it very well with Kate and all of the other people you talk about on the show that I watch.	0
I will tell you that sanctuary cities are -- they got a lot of problems, and if there is tremendous crime.	1
A lot of people agree with me.	0
This was a campaign issue.	0
This isn't just brought up now.	0
California in many ways is out of control, as you know.	0
And from an economic standpoint, people are leaving California and going to Texas and other places that run in a different manner, but we will see what happens.	0
We will certainly not stand for sanctuary even cities, let alone states.	0
You mentioned Kate's Law.	0
Why do you think the Democratic Party opposes Kate's Law?	0
It seems so logical.	0
Yes.	0
It's so logical.	0
There are many things that are very logical, the tax cuts are logical but the Democrats who want to raise taxes --	0
But you didn't answer my question.	0
Why do the Democrats oppose, oppose, protecting Americans from violent foreign criminals?	0
Why?	0
Because they think that is their voter.	0
You know what is fascinating, to watch you at the inauguration with Barack Obama.	0
You guys seem to get along.	0
All right?	0
Would that be accurate?	0
It's a very strange phenomenon.	0
We get along.	0
I don't know if he will admit this, but he likes me.	0
How do you know he likes you?	0
I like him because I can feel it.	0
You know, that is what I do in life, it's called like, I understand.	0
Now, we had a rough campaign.	0
He was fighting better for Hillary than she did.	0
He was vicious during the campaign toward me, and I was vicious toward him.	0
We said horrible things about each other.	0
And then we hopped into the car and we drive down Pennsylvania Avenue together.	0
We don't even talk about it.	0
Politics is amazing.	0
What did you talk about?	0
We talked about the country.	0
We talked about the future of the country.	0
I asked him about what you think our biggest problem is, and he told me that I can't tell you, but it's a problem.	0
It's a military problem.	0
China?	0
No, it's not China.	0
No?	0
No, it is, he did mention -- because I did ask him, I said, what would you say one, two, three problems are?	0
And the number one problem that he felt I was a little bit surprised but I fully understand --	0
But you can't tell us?	0
I can't do that.	0
I can't do that.	0
Not for any other reason other than I don't think he would mind if I said it.	0
I don't want to let that particular place know that that's the way he or I feel.	0
But we had a great -- it was a great inauguration.	0
I loved every minute of it, and I got along with him.	0
In fact, people were sort of surprised.	0
I finished, I turned around, he was smiling, I was smiling.	0
It was fascinating.	0
But here's what was more fascinating.	0
Right after you guys embraced, shook hands, all of that, you gave a speech.	0
But your speech excoriated him.	0
You basically took his administration apart, and he is sitting five feet away from you.	0
In your mind, did you say, how is he reacting to this speech?	0
See, I am an honest person, the country has a very, very deep- seated problems.	0
We have to do something about it.	0
And if you noticed, when I finish my speech, I turned around, shook his hand --	0
Yes.	0
Absolutely.	0
And he was very gracious.	0
And smiling.	0
I don't know if he was happy with that.	0
I don't know, but he seemed to be.	0
But this isn't just a knock on him.	0
We have been going down the wrong path for many years beyond him.	0
[End Video Clip]	0
Now, tomorrow, I asked the President some personal questions about his White House experience so far.	0
I think you will find it interesting.	0
[End Part 2]	0
[Begin Part 3]	0
What is the most surprising thing for you about this job you have?	0
You come from the private sector, no political office, now, you are the President of United States.	0
What surprised you?	0
I think the size, the magnitude of everything.	0
So, I was a very big real estate person.	0
I build a building for 500 million or $900 million.	0
And here, you look at an airplane contract where you can save $600 million on 90 plans.	0
I saved more than $600 million.	0
I got involved in negotiation on a fighter jet, the F-35.	0
And by the way, Lockheed Martin, a great company.	0
But they weren't bringing their price up.	0
I got involved, I saved more than $600 million.	0
I was very proud of that.	0
But the magnitude of -- you can do that at every level of government.	0
My new thing is going to be Pharma because we pay too much with the largest drug purchaser in the world.	0
And they don't negotiate.	0
How many hours a day you're working?	0
I'm working long hours.	0
Long hours.	0
Right up until 12:00, 1:00 in the morning.	0
What time do you get up?	0
Five o'clock.	0
All right.	0
And you are working after you have breakfast?	0
I read the papers, I see what is going on, I take a look.	0
I see the lies, you know, the lies -- that is another thing.	0
I always got good press.	0
You know, I was a business guy, I got good press.	0
[Laughter]	0
I know.	0
I have never -- I collect, you know, fake news.	0
Some of the networks and some of the papers -- the level of dishonesty, when they take a story that should be good, I know good from bad.	0
Sure.	0
They take something that should be a good story, in fact, sometimes, I say, oh, this is going to be nice to read and say, whoa.	0
And they will purposely totally change it.	0
It is fake news.	0
Why are they doing that?	0
Well, because I am on the other side of the equation.	0
They did it to Reagan but not as much.	0
Why?	0
I don't understand.	0
I just think that it is just the other side of the coin.	0
You know, they called themselves progressive, which is a beautiful word.	0
But it's not true.	0
Do you think they don't like you?	0
When you look at what happens -- I don't know.	0
I think they don't like my -- I don't think they like anybody on our side.	0
I know you for a long time and I know that, you know, when people attack you personally, that bothers you.	0
So, they are saying that you are anti-Muslim.	0
They are saying you are anti-Black.	0
They are saying you are anti-poor.	0
Do you respond, because you do come back?	0
I always respond.	0
I mean, but does it hurt your feelings that they are making you into a hater?	0
No because they always do it.	0
The first thing they do with the Republicans or conservatives is the racist card.	0
They pull out the racist card.	0
They always do.	0
Not just me.	0
I mean, they do it with everybody.	0
And I see that and once you know that, you feel a lot better about it.	0
Is there any validity to the criticism of you that you say things you can't back up factually?	0
And as the President -- you can do that as a candidate or businessman.	0
But if you say for example that there are three million illegal aliens who voted and then, you don't have the data to back it up, some people is going to say, that is irresponsible for a president to say that.	1
Is there any validity?	0
Well, many people have come out and said I am right.	0
You know that.	0
I know but you have to have the data to back that up.	0
And doesn't have to do with a vote, although, that is the end result, it has to do with the registration.	0
And when you look at the registration, and you see dead people that have voted, that are on many, many dead people are on that have voted, when you see people that are registered in two states that voted in two states, when you see other things, when you see illegals, people that are not citizens, and they are on the registration rolls.	1
See?	0
What they do is they load up the registration rolls.	0
There is a lot of bad things happening.	0
Look, Bill, we can be babies but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this, it is really a bad situation.	0
It is really bad.	0
So, you think you're going to be proven correct in that statement?	0
Well, I think I already have.	0
A lot of people have come out and said that I am right.	0
Yes.	0
But the data has to show that three million illegals voted.	0
Look, we have a lot of different -- you go to the voting booths and you see what was going on.	0
But to get that -- forget all of that.	0
Just take a look at the registration as we're going to do it.	0
I'm going to set up a commission to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence and we are going to look at it very, very carefully.	0
Well, that is good.	0
Yes.	0
Let's get to the bottom of it.	0
Do you ever think you were going to convince the media, the American media, to give -- and I know that you don't feel you are getting a fair shot, okay?	0
So, you don't, either.	0
Because I watch and you say -- In many cases --	0
[Crosstalk]	0
You say you're not getting a fair shot because you said, ideology drives the news coverage and it shouldn't.	0
News coverage should be news coverage, not ideological.	0
What I do, I am an analyst, I can do whatever I want.	0
And I have criticized you and you know what and you come right back at me and that is good.	0
That is a good thing.	0
But there are entities in this country that despise you and your administration.	0
Can you, do you think you can ever convince them to take it down a bit?	0
Mr. President, thanks very much for taking the time.	0
Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.	0
Story Continued Below Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.	0
We will be a country of generosity and warmth.	0
But we will also be a country of law and order.	0
Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation.	0
The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life.	0
Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.	0
Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.	0
Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.	0
I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end.	0
Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.	0
The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens.	0
Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.	0
It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.	0
I will present the facts plainly and honestly.	0
We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.	0
So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.	0
But here, at our convention, there will be no lies.	0
We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.	0
Trump speech draft leaks hours in advance By NICK GASS These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.	1
Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities.	1
That’s the largest increase in 25 years.	1
In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent.	0
They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.	0
In the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone.	0
And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.	0
The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.	0
Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.	1
The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.	1
They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.	0
One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska.	0
There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root.	0
She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average.	0
Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.	0
I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family.	0
But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting.	0
One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders.	0
What about our economy?	0
Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed.	0
2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago.	1
Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.	0
Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000.	1
Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high – nearly $800 billion in a single year.	1
The budget is no better.	0
President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing.	0
Yet, what do we have to show for it?	0
Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.	1
Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.	0
Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another.	0
We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.	0
This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made.	0
Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant nothing.	0
In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.	0
America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy.	0
I am certain it is a decision he truly regrets.	0
Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused the disasters unfolding today.	0
Let’s review the record.	0
In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.	1
Libya was cooperating.	0
Egypt was peaceful.	0
Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.	0
Iran was being choked by sanctions.	0
Syria was under control.	0
After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have?	0
ISIS has spread across the region, and the world.	0
Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.	0
Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control.	0
Iraq is in chaos.	0
Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons.	0
Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West.	0
After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.	0
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness.	0
But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy.	0
The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.	0
A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes.	0
Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.	0
The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First.	0
Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.	0
As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.	0
This will all change in 2017.	0
The American People will come first once again.	0
My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism.	0
There can be no prosperity without law and order.	0
On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.	0
A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests.	0
That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.	0
Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.	0
They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does.	0
She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.	0
That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change.	0
My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.	0
Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.	0
I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals.	0
These are the forgotten men and women of our country.	0
People who work hard but no longer have a voice.	0
I AM YOUR VOICE.	0
I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.	0
I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.	0
When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way.	0
And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.	0
When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.	0
They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.	0
In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others have paid so dearly.	0
When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.	0
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.	0
Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.	0
I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.	0
But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade.	0
Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans.	0
In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.	0
We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana.	0
He is a man of character and accomplishment.	0
He is the right man for the job.	0
The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.	0
America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed.	0
In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials.	0
Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.	0
On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.	0
Three were killed, and four were badly injured.	0
An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans.	0
I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country.	0
Leaked document: Trump will tell the nation, 'I am your voice' By ELI STOKOLS and NICK GASS I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done.	0
In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.	0
The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.	0
This Administration has failed America’s inner cities.	0
It’s failed them on education.	0
It’s failed them on jobs.	0
It’s failed them on crime.	0
It’s failed them at every level.	0
When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.	0
Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?	0
To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS.	0
Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.	0
Men, women and children viciously mowed down.	0
Lives ruined.	0
Families ripped apart.	0
A nation in mourning.	0
The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.	0
Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist.	0
This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community.	0
As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.	0
To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.	0
We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world.	0
We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria.	0
Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror.	0
This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.	0
Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.	0
My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama.	1
She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.	1
I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.	0
Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.	0
Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.	0
We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.	0
On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw.	0
They are just three brave representatives of many thousands.	0
Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.	0
These families have no special interests to represent them.	0
There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.	0
My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain.	0
Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.	1
But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle?	0
Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel?	0
Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?	0
These wounded American families have been alone.	0
But they are alone no longer.	0
Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.	0
We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities.	0
I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.	0
By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence.	0
Illegal border crossings will go down.	0
Peace will be restored.	0
By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.	0
Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.	0
On January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced.	0
We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.	0
But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.	0
My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton.	0
Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration.	0
Communities want relief.	0
Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.	0
Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.	0
I have a different vision for our workers.	0
It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat.	0
It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.	0
I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I’m going to make our country rich again.	0
I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones.	0
America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.	1
Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.	0
Never again.	0
I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.	0
My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class.	0
She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes.	0
She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea.	0
She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.	0
I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence.	0
Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.	0
No longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands.	0
We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.	0
This includes stopping China’s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation.	0
Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated.	0
That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we’ll walk away if we don’t get the deal that we want.	0
We are going to start building and making things again.	0
Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules.	0
While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican.	1
Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.	1
America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.	1
Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.	0
Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all.	0
Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it.	0
We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.	0
This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.	0
My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work – that will never happen when I am President.	0
With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.	0
This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow.	0
This, in turn, will create millions more jobs.	0
We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.	0
My opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children.	0
We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.	0
You will be able to choose your own doctor again.	0
And we will fix TSA at the airports!	0
We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.	0
We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before.	0
My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is.	0
We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days.	0
The politicians have talked about it, I’m going to do it.	0
We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.	0
The replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles.	0
This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election.	0
My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment.	1
I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.	0
At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive.	0
You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.	0
An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.	1
I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans.	0
We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again.	0
It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.	0
In this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy.	0
My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew.	0
I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.	0
It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.	0
He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also.	0
Then there’s my mother, Mary.	0
She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded.	0
She was a truly great mother.	0
She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character.	0
To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me.	0
I have loved my life in business.	0
But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you.	0
It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people.	0
But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.	0
America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.	0
Remember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here tonight.	0
No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.	0
Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.	0
History is watching us now.	0
It’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.	0
My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge.	0
It reads: “I’m With Her”.	0
I choose to recite a different pledge.	0
My pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.” I am your voice.	0
So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.	0
To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again.	0
We Will Make America Proud Again.	0
We Will Make America Safe Again.	0
And We Will Make America Great Again.	0
THANK YOU.	0
Well, thank you, Dr. Price.	0
And good afternoon to all.	0
To the families who are gathered here from all across America, on behalf of the First Family, welcome to the White House.	0
Since the first day of this administration, President Donald Trump has been working to keep the promises that he made to the American people to rebuild our military, revive our economy.	0
And this President has worked tirelessly to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
President Trump knows that every day Obamacare survives is another day that American families and American businesses struggle.	0
As we've traveled across the country, we've heard firsthand from Americans just like those who stand behind me today, from families who are bearing the cost of skyrocketing premiums and plummeting choices, from families who've lost their doctors, lost their insurance, and from families who are starting to lose hope that Congress will ever respond.	0
But as I've told every one of them and people all across this country, thanks to the leadership of President Trump, help is on the way.	0
President Trump hears you.	0
He is fighting for you, and he will keep fighting every day until we give the American people access to the world-class health care they deserve.	0
Tomorrow, the United States Senate will have the opportunity to begin the debate on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
And as the President said this morning, after years of talking and campaigning on it, now is the time for Republicans in the Senate to act.	0
"Republicans in the Senate will have in his words a ""chance to do the right thing"" to keep their promise to the American people and these families and families all across this country."	0
And this President and the American people are counting on the Senate to act.	0
So with gratitude for his leadership and his persistence and determination to make American health care great again, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to these families and to all of you the 45th President of the United States of America -- President Donald Trump.	0
[Applause]	0
Well thank you very much Vice President Pence, Secretary Price, and thank you everyone for being here today.	0
For the past 17 years, Obamacare has wreaked havoc on the lives of innocent hardworking Americans.	0
Behind me today, we have real American families, great families.	0
We've spent a lot of time with them.	0
We're suffering, because, seven years ago a small group of politicians and special interests in Washington engineered a government takeover of health care.	0
Every pledge that Washington Democrats made to pass that bill turned out to be a lie.	0
It was a big fat ugly lie.	0
Democrats promised Americans like Steve Finn, a former police officer in West Virginia, that they would save $2,500 a year under Obamacare.	0
Instead, his premiums have more than tripled.	0
That's pretty bad.	0
As a result of Obamacare skyrocketing cost, Steve and his family, and many of his employees, had no other option than going on Medicaid and giving up their existing coverage.	0
No choice.	0
For them, Obamacare, as promised, was a nightmare.	0
Marjorie and Kevin Weer from South Carolina, have a son Monty who suffers from Spina Bifida.	0
Washington Democrats promise families like the Weer's that if they like their doctor, they could keep their doctor.	0
But now there's only one insurer left in the state exchange and Marjorie says that every year she waits anxious to learn if the doctors and hospitals, which our son needs the most, will remain in their network.	0
More Obamacare lies, and you've seen that up front, unfortunately, up front and personal.	0
The Democrats promised Melissa Ackinson that her son's pre-existing conditions would be covered.	0
The Ackinson quickly learned that Obamacare's promise of covering for pre-existing conditions was meaningless, though, if the doctors you need for your care aren't on your Obamacare plan.	0
So you just have a meaningless promise and everybody knows it, and most people on Obamacare know it.	0
After an excruciating series of events and complications, Melissa and her husband found themselves just before Christmas, emotionally and financially devastated crying in a doctor's office, faced with yet another seemingly unpayable bill.	0
When insurance wouldn't cover the Ackinson's care, they emptied out Melissa's 401k to pay their bills.	0
They're not going to be, and they haven't been the first.	0
There are many many cases such as that.	0
The 401ks.	0
The first rule of medicine, is do no harm, but Obamacares lies, have caused this, and throughout the whole country, families like this, nothing but pain.	0
Erin and Andy Witzig, our small business owners from Illinois.	0
They have six children, their youngest daughter Poppy has a rare genetic condition.	0
Children born with it or sometimes called butterfly children, because their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly.	0
Poppy has to wear special bandages all of the time.	0
Unfortunately, under Obamacare.	0
Poppy's insurance has been repeatedly discontinued and replaced with what Washington deems equivalent policies, but for Poppy, these plans are not equivalent and Poppy's family has to spend precious time and tremendous resources fighting for exceptions for Poppy.	0
The Washington politicians who made those promises to Steve, Marjorie, Melissa, Erin and their beautiful children want to ignore all the pain, all the suffering and all of the money, the tremendous amounts of money, that these lies have caused.	0
They want to forget about the countless Americans they've hurt.	0
and the many that they are continuing to hurt every day, by refusing to help us replace Obamacare.	0
For the last seven years, Republicans have been united and standing up for Obamacare's victims, remember, repeal and replace, repeal and replace.	0
They kept saying it over And over again.	0
Every Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law.	0
We, as a party, must fulfill that solemn promise to the voters of this country, to repeal and replace what they've been saying for the last seven years.	0
But so far Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare.	0
They now have a chance, however, to hopefully, hopefully fix what has been so badly broken for such a long time, and that is through replacement of a horrible disaster known as Obamacare.	0
The Senate is very close to the votes it needs to pass a replacement.	0
The problem is, we have zero help from the Democrats.	0
They're obstructionist, that's all they are.	0
That's all they're good at is obstruction, making things not work.	0
They say all the right things, and then they do exactly what they're not supposed to be doing.	0
The Democrats aren't giving us one vote, so we need virtually every single vote from the Republicans.	0
Not easy to do.	0
The Senate bill that is being considered outside of the outright repeal of Obamacare will also provide emergency relief for the law's victims, and it will deliver truly great health care and health care reforms that our citizens want, need and really should be demanding.	0
Some are demanding.	0
You'll see that at the voter booth.	0
believe me.	0
Here are just some of these terrific reforms that we will be doing if everything works out the way it should.	0
The Senate bill eliminates the painful individual mandate.	0
It eliminates the job-killing employer mandate, repeals other burdensome taxes, and will significantly lower Americans premiums.	0
It will stabilize collapsing health insurance markets and give Americans far more choice and far more flexibility.	0
The Senate bill protects coverage for pre-existing conditions, and you don't hear this from the Democrats.	0
They like to tell you just the opposite, and they didn't even know the bill.	0
They run out, they say: death, death, death.	0
Well, Obamacare is death, that's the one that's death.	0
And, besides that, it's failing, so you won't have it anyway.	0
It dramatically expands popular health savings accounts	0
It provides tax credits, so Americans can purchase a private plan that is right for them and their families.	0
It devotes substantial resources to fight the opioid, and this is a tremendous problem, the opioid epidemic.	0
$45 billion is being put in, so that the people of many states like New Hampshire, Ohio and so many others that have such a big problem, can be helped and helped greatly.	0
Gonna be fighting the drug problems very, very seriously, in my administration.	0
And it provides among many other things, higher quality care and more flexibility for states to administer Medicaid to better serve their poorest citizens.	0
Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on whether to allow this urgently needed bill to come to the Senate floor for debate.	0
The question for every senator, Democrat or Republican, is whether they will side with Obamacare's architects which have been so destructive to our country, or with it's forgotten victims.	0
Any senator who votes against starting debate, is telling America that you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, which is what it is.	0
For Democrats, this vote is a chance to make up for the terrible harm they have inflicted on Americans, like those who are with us today, Obamacare has been for them a nightmare.	0
There is still time to do the right thing and for Senate Republicans, this is their chance to keep their promise.	0
Over and over again, they said, repeal and replace, repeal and replace.	0
But they can now keep their promise to the American people to provide emergency relief to those in desperate need of help and to improve health care for all Americans.	0
To every member of the Senate, I say this: the American people have waited long enough.	0
There's been enough talk and no action.	0
Now is the time for action.	0
We are here to solve problems for the people.	0
Obamacare has broken our health care system.	1
It's broken.	0
It's collapsing.	0
It's gone.	0
And now it is up to us to get great health care for the American people.	0
We must repeal and replace Obamacare now.	0
Thank you.	0
God bless you.	0
God bless the United States of America.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
Good evening from the campus of Lynn University here in Boca Raton, Florida.	0
This is the fourth and last debate of the 2012 campaign, brought to you by the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
This one's on foreign policy.	0
I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.	0
The questions are mine, and I have not shared them with the candidates or their aides.	0
The audience has taken a vow of silence — no applause, no reaction of any kind except right now when we welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney.	0
(Sustained cheers, applause.)	0
Gentlemen, your campaigns have agreed to certain rules and they are simple.	0
They have asked me to divide the evening into segments.	0
I'll pose a question at the beginning of each segment.	0
You will each have two minutes to respond, and then we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment.	0
Tonight's debate, as both of your know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that President Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba — perhaps the closest we've ever come to nuclear war.	0
And it is a sobering reminder that every president faces at some point an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad.	0
So let's begin.	0
The first segment is the challenge of a changing Middle East and the new face of terrorism.	0
I'm going to put this into two segments, so you'll have two topic questions within this one segment on that subject.	0
The first question, and it concerns Libya, the controversy over what happened there continues.	0
Four Americans are dead, including an American ambassador.	0
Questions remain.	0
What happened?	0
What caused it?	0
Was it spontaneous?	0
Was it an intelligence failure?	0
Was it a policy failure?	0
Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened?	0
Governor Romney, you said this was an example of an American policy in the Middle East that is unraveling before our very eyes.	0
I'd like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that.	0
Governor Romney, you won the toss.	0
You go first.	0
Thank you, Bob, and thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.	0
Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here, and Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.	0
We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it's nice to maybe be funny this time not on purpose.	0
We'll see what happens.	0
(Laughter.)	0
This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world and to America in particular, which is to see a — a complete change in the — the — the structure and the — the environment in the Middle East.	0
With the Arab Spring came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women and — and public life and in economic life in the Middle East.	0
But instead we've seen in nation after nation a number of disturbing events.	0
Of course, we see in Syria 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.	0
We see in — in — in Libya an attack apparently by — well, I think we know now by terrorists of some kind against — against our people there, four people dead.	0
Our hearts and minds go to them.	0
Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali, by al-Qaida-type individuals.	0
We have in — in Egypt a Muslim Brotherhood president.	0
And so what we're seeing is a — a — a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.	0
Of course, the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon.	0
And — and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.	0
I congratulate him on — on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaida.	0
But we can't kill our way out of this mess.	0
We're — we're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the — the world of Islam and — and other parts of the world reject this radical violent extremism which is — it's really not on the run.	0
It's certainly not hiding.	0
This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	0
Mr. President.	0
Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe, and that's what we've done over the last four years.	0
We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11.	0
And as a consequence, al-Qaida's core leadership has been decimated.	0
In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security, and that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.	0
Now, with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened; and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans, and we would bring them to justice, and that's exactly what we're going to do.	0
But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.	0
Now, keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to — without putting troops on the ground, at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq — liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years, got rid of a despot who had killed Americans.	0
And as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying, America's our friend.	0
We stand with them.	0
Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	0
And you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after al-Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.	0
Well, my strategy's pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to — to kill them, to take them out of the picture.	0
But my strategy is broader than — than that.	0
That's — that's important, of course, but the key that we're going to have to pursue is a — is a pathway to — to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.	0
We don't want another Iraq.	0
We don't want another Afghanistan.	0
That's not the right course for us.	0
The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the — the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these — these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	0
And how we do that?	0
A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the — the world reject these — these terrorists.	0
And the answer they came up was this.	0
One, more economic development.	0
We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment and that of our friends — we should coordinate it to make sure that we — we push back and give them more economic development.	0
Number two, better education.	0
Number three, gender equality.	0
Number four, the rule of law.	0
We have to help these nations create civil societies.	0
But what's been happening over the last couple years as we watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see al-Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.	0
And — and they're throughout many nations of the Middle East.	0
It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy, but next door, of course, we have Egypt.	0
Libya's 6 million population, Egypt 80 million population.	0
We want — we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.	0
With Mali now having North Mali taken over by al-Qaida, with Syria having Assad continuing to — or to kill — to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.	0
And of course Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.	0
We've got real gaps in the region.	0
We'll get to that, but let's give the president a chance.	0
Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida's a threat because a few months ago when you were asked, what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia — not al-Qaida, you said Russia.	1
And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.	0
But, Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	0
You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq, but just a few weeks ago you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.	0
And the — the challenge we have — I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy, but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong.	0
You said we should have gone into Iraq despite the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	0
You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.	0
You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia, despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.	0
You've said that first we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan then you said we should.	0
Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong but you were also confusing and sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.	0
So what — what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.	0
And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength or keeping America safe over the long term.	0
I'm going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond.	0
Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.	0
They don't happen to be accurate.	0
But — but I can say this: that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing and the rising tide of tumult and — and confusion.	0
And — and attacking me is not an agenda.	0
Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East and take advantage of the opportunity there and stem the tide of this violence.	0
But I'll respond to a couple of the things you mentioned.	0
First of all, Russia, I indicated, is a geopolitical foe, not --	0
Number one --	0
Excuse me.	0
It's a geopolitical foe.	0
And I said in the same — in the same paragraph, I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.	0
Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.	0
I have clear eyes on this.	0
I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin, and I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.	0
After the election he'll get more backbone.	0
Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed, I believe, that there should have been a status of forces agreement.	0
Did you --	0
That's not true.	0
Oh, you didn't — you didn't want a status of forces agreement?	0
No, but what I — what I would not have done is left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.	0
That certainly would not help us in the Middle East.	0
I'm sorry, you actually — there was a --	0
Here — here is — here is --	0
There was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement.	0
And I concurred in that and said we should have some number of troops that stayed on.	0
That was something I concurred with.	0
Governor --	0
That was your posture.	0
That was my posture as well.	0
I thought it should have been 5,000 troops.	0
Governor --	0
I thought it should have been more troops.	0
But you — (inaudible).	0
This is just a few weeks ago.	0
The answer was, we got no troop (through ?)	0
whatsoever.	0
This is just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.	0
No, I didn't.	0
I'm sorry, that's --	0
You made a major speech.	0
I indicated — I indicated that you failed to put in place a status of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that --	0
Governor --	0
Governor, here's — here's one thing — here's one thing — here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.	0
Let him have — (inaudible).	0
You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.	0
Now, you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.	0
That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.	0
Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just beat these challenges militarily, and so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do, is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts; number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel's security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.	0
Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population — not just half of it — is developing.	0
Number four, we do have to develop their economic — their economic capabilities.	0
But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.	0
Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.	0
That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.	0
Let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the Middle East and so on, and that is, you both mentioned — alluded to this, and that is Syria.	0
The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon.	0
We have, what, more than a hundred people that were killed there in a bomb.	0
There were demonstrations there, eight people dead.	0
Mr. President, it's been more than a year since you saw — you told Assad he had to go.	0
Since then 30,000 Syrians have died.	0
We've had 300,000 refugees.	0
The war goes on.	0
He's still there.	0
Should we reassess our policy and see if we can find a better way to influence events there, or is that even possible?	0
And it's you — you go first, sir.	0
What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.	0
We've mobilized sanctions against that government.	0
We have made sure that they are isolated.	0
We have provided humanitarian assistance, and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.	0
But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.	0
And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel, which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria, coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.	0
Now, this — what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.	0
But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step.	0
And we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping, that we're not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or our allies in the region.	0
And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.	0
But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.	0
Governor.	0
Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is.	0
First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster.	0
Secondly, Syria's an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	0
Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	0
It's their route to the sea.	0
It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally Israel.	0
And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.	0
Number two, seeing a — a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us.	0
And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.	0
We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.	0
And so the right course for us is working through our partners and with our own resources to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a — in a form of — of — if not government, a form of — of council that can take the lead in Syria, and then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.	0
We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the — the wrong hands.	0
Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.	0
We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies and particularly with — with — with Israel.	0
But the Saudis and the Qatari and — and — and the Turks are all very concerned about this.	0
They're willing to work with us.	0
We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the — the — the insurgents there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed are people who will be the responsible parties.	0
Recognize I believe that Assad must go.	0
I believe he will go.	0
But I believe we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place such that in the years to come we see Syria as a — as a friend and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.	0
This — this is a critical opportunity for America.	0
And what I'm afraid of is that we've watched over the past year or so first the president saying, well, we'll let the U.N. deal with it, and Assad — excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and — and said, we're going to try — have a cease-fire.	0
That didn't work.	0
Then it looked to the Russians and said, see if you can do something.	0
we should.	0
We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military --	0
All right.	0
— by the leadership role.	0
We are — we playing the leadership role.	0
"We organized the ""Friends of Syria."""	0
We are mobilizing humanitarian support and support for the opposition.	0
And we are making sure that that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.	0
But you know, going back to Libya, because this is an example of — of how we make choices, you know, when we went into Libya and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize, we also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.	0
And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.	0
But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.	0
Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.	0
That — Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.	0
And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.	0
That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.	0
But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with.	0
And we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria.	0
That's exactly what we're doing.	0
Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do?	0
Like, for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria?	0
I don't — I don't want to have our military involved in — in Syria.	0
I don't think there's a necessity to put our military in Syria at — at this stage.	0
I don't anticipate that in the future.	0
As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us — a responsible government, if possible.	0
And I want to make sure the get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves but also to remove — to remove Assad.	0
But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of — of our — of our troops.	0
And this isn't — this isn't going to be necessary.	0
We have — with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups.	0
But look, this has been going on for a year.	0
This is a time — this should have been a time for American leadership.	0
We should have taken a leading role — not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally, to bring together the parties there to find responsible parties.	0
As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the insurgents are highly disparate.	0
They haven't come together.	0
They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind.	0
That needs to happen.	0
America can help that happen.	0
And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role, which is getting rid of Assad.	0
Could we get a quick response, Mr. President, because I want to ask --	0
Well, I'll — I'll — I'll be — I'll be very quick.	0
What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas, and that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate, Syrian leadership and a — an effective transition so that we get Assad out.	0
That's the kind of leadership we've shown.	0
That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.	0
May I ask you, you know, during the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for President Mubarak to go.	0
Right.	0
Some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that.	0
Do you have any regrets about that?	0
No, I don't because I think that America has to stand with democracy.	0
The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	0
But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities — and we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that — to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region.	0
These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.	0
They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.	0
That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.	0
They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.	0
And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately, what's going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt but also for the world is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.	0
Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.	0
They want jobs.	0
They want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.	0
They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have a — the prospects of a better life in the future.	0
And so one of the things that we've been doing is — is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to — to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that's noncorrupt, that's transparent.	0
But what is also important for us to understand is — is that for America to be successful in this region, there are some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.	0
You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.	0
And we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	0
And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do here.	0
Governor Romney, I want to hear your response to that, but I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak?	0
No, I believe, as the president indicated and said at the time, that I supported his — his action there.	0
I felt that — I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.	0
I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president's term and even further back than that, that we'd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world and that we would have worked more aggressively with our — our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government such that it didn't explode in the way it did.	0
But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these — these freedom voices in the — the streets of Egypt where the people who were speaking of our principles and the — the — President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable, and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.	0
Let me — let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East, and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more — is peaceful.	0
We want a peaceful planet.	0
We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future and not be at war.	0
That's our purpose.	0
And the mantle of — of leadership for promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.	0
We didn't ask for it, but it's an honor that we have it.	0
But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong, and that begins with a strong economy here at home, and unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.	0
When the — when the — the president of Iraq — excuse me — of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that's a frightening thing.	0
The former chief of — chief of the Joints Chief of Staff said that — Admiral Mullen — said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.	0
This — we have weakened our economy.	0
We need a strong economy.	0
We need to have as well a strong military.	0
Our military is second to none in the world.	0
We're blessed with terrific soldiers and extraordinary technology and intelligence.	0
But the idea of a trillion dollars in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.	0
We need to have strong allies.	0
Our association and — and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.	0
We're the — the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.	0
And finally, we have to stand by our principles.	0
And if we're strong in each of those things, American influence will grow.	0
But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago.	0
All right.	0
And that's because we've become weaker on each of those four dimensions.	0
All right — perfect.	0
You're going to get a chance to respond to that because that's a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is what is America's role in the world.	0
And that is the question.	0
What do each of you see as our role in the world?	0
And I believe, Governor Romney, it's your turn to go first.	0
Well, I — I absolutely believe that America has a — a responsibility and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that — that make the world more peaceful.	0
And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections, because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace.	0
They don't vote for war.	0
So we want to — to promote those principles around the world.	0
We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.	0
We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.	0
But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	0
America must lead.	0
And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.	0
You can't have 23 million people struggling to get a job.	0
You — you can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.	0
You can't have kids coming out of college, half of whom can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree.	0
We have to get our economy going.	0
And our military — we've got to strengthen our military long- term.	0
We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.	0
We — we make decisions today in a military that — that will confront challenges we can't imagine.	0
In the 2000 debates there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.	0
And a year later, 9/11 happened.	0
So we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty.	0
And that means a strong military.	0
I will not cut our military budget.	0
We have to also stand by our allies.	0
I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.	0
I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way did we was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.	0
And then of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when — when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred.	0
For the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake.	0
We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.	0
Mr. President.	0
America remains the one indispensable nation.	0
And the world needs a strong America.	0
And it is stronger now than when I came into office.	0
Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.	0
It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.	0
And, Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger — in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.	0
But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America.	0
And that's what my plan does: Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas; making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow; doing everything we can to control our own energy.	0
We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas, but we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.	0
That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.	0
And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.	0
Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it.	0
We've got to do it in a responsible way, by cutting out spending we don't need but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.	0
That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.	0
Now Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.	0
You know, both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies.	0
He's praised George Bush as good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who shows great wisdom and judgment.	0
And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	0
Governor Romney, wrong and reckless policies?	0
(Chuckles.)	0
I've got a policy for the future and an agenda for the future.	0
And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take- home pay.	0
And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.	0
The — the president said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	0
We're 9 million jobs short of that.	0
I will get America working again and see rising take- home pay again.	0
And I'll do it with five simple steps.	0
Number one, were going to have North American energy independence.	0
We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	0
Number two, we're going to increase our trade.	0
Trade grows about 12 percent per year.	0
It doubles about every — every five or — or so years.	0
We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.	0
The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.	0
As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.	0
We're all focused on China.	0
Latin America is a huge opportunity for us: time zone, language opportunities.	0
Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers union's going to have to go behind.	0
And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.	0
We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their companies' money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.	0
And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	0
And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business.	0
Small business is where — where jobs come from.	0
Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.	0
New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	0
I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	0
First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses, but Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses' development ranked about 48, I think, out of 50 states, in Massachusetts, because the policies that you're promoting actually don't help small businesses.	0
And the way you define small businesses include folks at the very top.	0
They include you and me.	0
That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.	0
But — but let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference 21st century, and that's our education policy.	0
We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.	0
You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states.	0
We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time, and they're starting to finally make progress.	0
And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.	0
And those teachers can make a difference.	0
Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said, this isn't going to help the economy grow.	0
When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference.	0
But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference.	0
And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.	0
Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce.	0
And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward — when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.	0
That is not good for America's position in the world.	0
And the world notices.	0
Let me get back to foreign policy.	0
Well --	0
Can I just get back --	0
Well, I need to speak a moment if you'll let me, Bob --	0
OK.	0
— just about education, because I'm — I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.	0
We have, every two years, tests that look at how well our kids are doing.	0
Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.	0
While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English and then also in math, and our eighth graders number one in English and also in math — first time one state had been number one in all four measures.	0
How did we do that?	0
Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.	0
And that was --	0
Ten years earlier --	0
That was — that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.	0
And this is — and we were --	0
But that was 10 years before you took office.	0
And we — absolutely.	0
Gentlemen --	0
And then you cut education spending when you came into office.	0
The first — the first — and we kept our schools number one in the nation.	0
They're still number one today.	0
And the principles that we've put in place — we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that — that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to — to be able to compete, but also, if they graduated in the top quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition-free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.	0
That happened — that happened before you came into office.	0
Governor --	0
That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.	0
You got that fact wrong.	0
Let me — I want to try to shift it, because we have heard some of this in the other debates.	0
Governor, you say you want a bigger military.	0
You want a bigger Navy.	0
You don't want to cut defense spending.	0
What I want to ask you, we're talking about financial problems in this country.	0
Where are you going to get the money?	0
Well, let's — let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way — all the way through.	0
First of all, I'm going through, from the very beginning, we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget excluding military.	0
That's number one.	0
All right?	0
But can you do this without driving us deeper into debt?	0
The good news is, I'll be happy to have you take a look.	0
Come on our website, you'll look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years.	0
We do it by getting — by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.	0
"By the way, number one I get rid of is ""Obamacare."""	0
There are a number of things that sound good but, frankly, we just can't afford them.	0
And that one doesn't sound good, and it's not affordable, so I get rid of that one from day one; to the extent humanly possible, we get that out.	0
We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have and we get rid of them.	0
Number two, we take some programs that we are going to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor.	0
We're — take that health care program for the poor, and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently.	0
As a governor, I thought, please, give me this program.	0
Can he do that?	0
(Inaudible.)	0
I can run this more efficiently than the federal government.	0
And states, by the way, are proving it.	0
States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these Medicaid dollars, have shown they can run these programs more cost effectively.	0
Bob --	0
So I want to do those two things that gets us — it gets us to a balanced budget with eight in — eight to 10 years.	0
Bob --	0
But the military --	0
Let --	0
Let's go back to the military, though.	0
Well, that's what I'm trying to find out about.	0
Let's talk about the military.	0
You should have answered the first question.	0
Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions.	0
Now, the math doesn't work but he continues to claim that he's going to do it.	0
He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military's not asking for.	0
Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.	0
We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined — China, Russia, France, the United — United Kingdom, you name it, next 10.	0
And what I did was work with our Joint Chiefs of Staff to think about what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?	0
And that's the budget that we've put forward.	0
But what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts, you say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions without naming what those loopholes and deductions are, and then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.	1
The math simply doesn't work.	0
But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know, just budgets, we got to think about capabilities.	0
We need to be thinking about cybersecurity.	0
We need to be thinking about space.	0
That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy.	0
It's not driven by politics.	0
It's not driven by members of Congress and what they would like to see.	0
It's driven by what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?	0
That's exactly what our budget does.	0
And it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.	0
Bob, I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.	0
I was in the world of business for 25 years.	0
If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.	0
I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance and made a success there.	1
I had the chance to be governor of a state.	0
Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget.	0
We cut taxes 19 times, balanced our budget.	0
The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.	0
I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.	0
All right.	0
I — I'm going to be able to balance the budget.	0
Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.	0
Our Navy --	0
About 30 seconds.	0
Our Navy is older — excuse me — our Navy is smaller now than any time since 1917.	0
The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.	0
We're now down to 285.	0
We're headed down to the — to the low 200s if we go through with sequestration.	0
That's unacceptable to me.	0
I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	0
Our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since it was founded in 1947.	0
We've changed for the first time since FDR.	0
We — since FDR we had the — we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.	0
Now we're changing to one conflict.	0
Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the president of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.	0
And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is the combination of the budget cuts that the president has as well as the sequestration cuts.	0
That, in my view, is — is — is making our future less certain and less secure.	0
I won't do it.	0
Bob, I just need to comment on this.	0
First of all, the sequester is not something that I proposed.	0
It's something that Congress has proposed.	0
It will not happen.	0
The budget that we're talking about is not reducing our military spending.	0
It's maintaining it.	0
But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.	0
You — you mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.	0
Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets — (laughter) — because the nature of our military's changed.	0
We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them.	0
We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.	0
And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships.	0
It's — it's what are our capabilities.	0
And so when I sit down with the secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.	0
And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward, because it just don't work.	0
All right.	0
And you know, we've visited the website quite a bit.	0
And it still doesn't work.	0
A lot to cover.	0
I'd like — (murmurs) — I'd like to move to the next segment: red lines, Israel and Iran.	0
Would either of you — and you'll have two minutes, and President Obama, you have the first go at this one.	0
Would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States, which of course is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan?	0
And if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran?	0
It's certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that — when we made that promise to our allies.	0
Mr. President.	0
Well, first of all, Israel is a true friend.	0
It is our greatest ally in the region.	0
And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.	0
I've made that clear throughout my presidency.	0
And --	0
So you're saying we've already made that declaration?	0
I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.	0
And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.	0
In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.	0
But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States, Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.	0
I've made that clear when I came into office.	0
We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.	0
Their currency has dropped 80 percent.	0
Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.	0
So their economy is in a shambles.	0
And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security and it's threat to Israel's national security.	0
We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.	0
Iran's a state sponsor of terrorism, and for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to nonstate actors — that's unacceptable.	0
And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.	0
So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	0
They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.	0
The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.	0
I think that would be a mistake because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last rest, not the first resort.	0
Two minutes.	0
Well, first of all, I — I want to underscore the — the same point the president made, which is that if I'm president of the United States, when I'm president of the United States, we will stand with Israel.	0
And — and if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.	0
That's number one.	0
Number two, with regards to — to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran, is unacceptable to America.	0
It presents a threat not only to our friends, but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.	0
It's also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	0
And crippling sanctions are something I'd called for five years ago when I was in Israel speaking at the Herzliya Conference.	0
I laid out seven steps.	0
Crippling sanctions were number one.	0
And they do work.	0
You're seeing it right now in the economy.	0
It's absolutely the right thing to do to have crippling sanctions.	0
I'd have put them in place earlier, but it's good that we have them.	0
Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.	0
I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil can't come into our ports.	0
I imagine the EU would agree with us as well.	0
Not only ships couldn't, I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.	0
I would tighten those sanctions further.	0
Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.	0
I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.	0
His words amount to genocide incitation.	0
I would indict him for it.	0
I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world, the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.	0
We need to increase pressure time and time again on Iran because anything other than a — a — a solution to this which says — which stops this nuclear folly of theirs is unacceptable to America.	0
And of course, a military action is the last resort.	0
It is something one would only, only consider if all of the other avenues had been — had been tried to their full extent.	0
Let me ask both of you, there — as you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States, as part of an international group, have agreed in principle to talks about Iran's nuclear program.	0
What is the deal if there are such talks?	0
What is the deal that you would accept?	0
Mr. President.	0
Well, first of all, those were reports in the newspaper.	0
They are not true.	0
But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place, because they have the opportunity to re-enter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.	0
There are — there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world, for a better life.	0
And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision.	0
But the deal we'll accept is, they end their nuclear program.	0
It's very straightforward.	0
And you know, I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.	0
You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the some things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference, and it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking; it's meticulous.	0
We started from the day we got into office.	0
And the reason it was so important — and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world — is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China, because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions, we've had sanctions in place for a long time.	0
It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.	0
And we've got to maintain that pressure.	0
There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established; they convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program; there are inspections that are very intrusive.	0
But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.	0
In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.	0
And one last thing.	0
I'm — just to make this point: The clock is ticking.	0
We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.	0
And I've been very clear to them, you know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program, and that clock is ticking.	0
All right.	0
And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.	0
Governor.	0
I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration and — and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.	0
I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.	0
And I say that because from the very beginning, the president, in his campaign some four years ago, said he'd meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year.	0
He'd — he'd sit down with Chavez and — and Kim Jong-Il, with Castro and with — with President Ahmadinejad of — of Iran.	0
And — and I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the president of the United States.	0
And then the president began what I've called an apology tour of going to — to various nations in the Middle East and — and criticizing America.	1
I think they looked at that and saw weakness.	0
Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, the Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.	0
I think they noticed that as well.	0
And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel that — that they noticed that as well.	1
All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here; we can keep talks going on, but we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.	0
Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to — to create a — a — a --- a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.	0
That's unacceptable for us, and — and — and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.	0
And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	0
They must not develop nuclear capability.	0
And the way to make sure they understand that is by having from the very beginning the tightest sanctions possible.	0
They need to be tightened.	0
Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.	0
We need to indict Ahmadinejad.	0
We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.	0
Bob, let me just respond.	0
Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.	0
This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign, and every fact-checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.	0
And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.	0
And the fact is while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.	0
So I'll let the American people decide, judge who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.	0
And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place, and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.	0
And — and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.	0
When I came into office, the world was divided.	0
Iran was resurgent.	0
Iran is at its weakest point economically, strategically, militarily than since — than in many years.	0
And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to makes sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.	0
That's in America's national interest, and that will be the case so long as I'm president.	0
We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	0
We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	0
And — and we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they've — they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.	0
That's number one.	0
Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to — to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to — to Turkey and Iraq.	0
And — and by way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.	0
And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.	0
And then in those nations and on Arabic TV you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.	0
You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.	0
Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.	0
We have freed other nations from dictators.	0
Bob, let me — let me respond.	0
You know, if we're going to talk about trips that we've taken, you know, when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.	0
And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors, I didn't attend fundraisers, I went to Yad Vashem, the — the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the — the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.	0
And then I went down to the border towns of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas.	0
And I saw families there who showed me where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms, and I was reminded of — of what that would mean if those were my kids, which is why, as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.	0
So that's how I've used my travels when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.	0
And the central question at this point is going to be, who's going to be credible to all parties involved?	0
And they can look at my track record — whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities — and they can say that the president of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.	0
And — and that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.	0
What if — what if the prime minister of Israel called you on the phone and said: Our bombers are on the way.	0
We're going to bomb Iran.	0
What do you say?	0
Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature.	0
Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way or their fighters are on the way.	0
This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of action.	0
So you're saying just what --	0
I'm — that's — that's --	0
OK.	0
But let's see what — (inaudible) --	0
Yes, but let me — let me — let me come back — let's come back — let's come back and go back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and — and — and the president's statement that things are going so well.	0
Look, I — I look at what's happening around the world and I see Iran four years closer to a bomb.	0
I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.	0
I see jihadists continuing to spread.	0
Whether they're rising or just about the same level hard to — hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.	0
They're very, very strong.	0
I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.	0
I see our trade deficit with China larger than it's — growing larger every year as a matter of fact.	0
I look around the world and I don't feel that — you see North Korea continuing to export their nuclear technology.	0
Russia's said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar anymore; they're (back ?)	0
away from their nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.	0
I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	0
I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home, in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military and the way I think it ought to be, in part because of the — the — the turmoil with Israel.	0
I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.	0
No.	0
They asked him, please repair the tension — Democrat senators — please repair the damage in his — in his own party.	0
All right.	0
Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.	0
I mean, I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.	0
But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do, in the same way that you initially opposed a time table in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends; in the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there; the same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.	0
When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call.	0
But when you were a candidate in 2008 — as I was — and I said, if I got bin Laden in our sights, I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man, and you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.	1
And if we had asked Pakistan for permission, we would not have gotten it.	0
And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	0
You know, after we killed bin Laden, I was at Ground Zero for a memorial and talked to a — a — a young woman who was 4 years old when 9/11 happened.	0
And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying, Peyton (sp), I love you, and I will always watch over you.	0
And for the next decade she was haunted by that conversation.	0
And she said to me, you know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.	0
And when we do things like that, when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world, and it tells Peyton (sp) that we did not forget her father.	0
All right.	0
And — and I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership — and those decisions are not always popular.	0
Those decisions generally are not poll-tested.	0
And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.	0
But what the American people understand is, is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.	0
All right.	0
Let's go — and that leads us — this takes us right to the next segment, Governor, America's longest war, Afghanistan and Pakistan.	0
Bob --	0
Governor, you get to go first.	0
You can't — you can't — well, OK, but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.	0
With respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program there.	0
Well, that's probably true.	0
(Chuckles.)	0
And we'll — we'll give you --	0
We'll agree (with that ?	0
).	0
We'll catch you up.	0
The United States is scheduled to turn over responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghan government in 2014.	0
At that point we will withdraw our combat troops, leave a smaller force of Americans, if I understand our policy, in Afghanistan for training purposes.	0
It seems to me the key question here is what do you do if the deadline arrives and it is obvious the Afghans are unable to handle their security?	0
Do we still leave?	0
And I believe Governor Romney, it — you go first.	0
Well, we're going to be finished by 2014.	0
And when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.	0
The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.	0
We've seen progress over the past several years.	0
The surge has been successful, and the training program is proceeding apace.	0
There are now a large number of Afghan security forces, 350,000, that are — are ready to step in to provide security.	0
And — and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of — of 2014.	0
So our troops'll come home at that point.	0
I — I can tell you, at the same time, that — that we will make sure that we — we look at what's happening in Pakistan and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.	0
And — and I say that because I know a lot of people just feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.	0
And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the — in our nation feel that Pakistan (doesn't ?)	0
— being nice to us and that we should just walk away from them.	0
But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads, and they're rushing to build a lot more.	0
They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the — in the relatively near future.	0
They also have the Haqqani network and — and the Taliban existent within their country.	0
And so a — a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and us.	0
And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a — a more stable government and — and rebuild a relationship with us.	0
And that means that — that — that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.	0
So for me, I look at this as both a — a — a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction and also to get Afghanistan to be ready.	0
And they will be ready by the end of 2014.	0
Mr. President.	0
You know, when I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq, and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.	0
We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan.	0
And we did deliver a surge of troops.	0
That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.	0
And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.	0
Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we'd gone.	0
We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.	0
And so we decimated al-Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.	0
We then started to build up Afghan forces.	0
And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	0
Now, that transition's — has to take place in a responsible fashion.	0
We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.	0
But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war, it's time to do some nation-building here at home.	0
And what we can now do is free up some resources to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.	0
You know, I was having lunch with some — a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	0
When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	0
And what we've said is, let's change those certifications.	0
The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.	0
And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population, it was higher when I came into office.	1
So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.	0
All right.	0
Let me go to Governor Romney because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there.	0
General Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan.	0
We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama's — bin Laden.	0
It still provides safe haven for terrorists, yet we continue to give Pakistan billions of dollars.	0
Is it time for us to divorce Pakistan?	0
No, it's not time to divorce a nation on earth that has a hundred nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation — as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani network.	0
It's a nation that's not like — like others and that does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.	0
You've got the ISI, their intelligence organization is probably the most powerful of the — of the three branches there.	0
Then you have the military and then you have the — the civilian government.	0
This is a nation which if it falls apart — if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got — you've got terrorists there who could grab their — their hands onto those nuclear weapons.	0
This is — this is an important part of the world for us.	0
Pakistan is — is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now, but we have some work to do.	0
And I — I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.	0
We had to go into Pakistan; we had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.	0
That was the right thing to do.	0
And that upset them, but there was obviously a great deal of anger even before that.	0
But we're going to have to work with the — with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	0
And it's important for them, it's important for the nuclear weapons, it's important for the success of Afghanistan, because inside Pakistan you have a large group of Pashtuns that are — that are Taliban, that they're going to come rushing back into Afghanistan when we go.	0
And that's one of the reasons the Afghan security forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.	0
But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.	0
But we do need to make sure that as we — as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on — on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	0
Let me ask you, Governor, because we know President Obama's position on this, what is — what is your position on the use of drones?	0
Well, I believe that we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.	0
And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that entirely and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology and believe that we should continue to use it to continue to go after the people who represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.	0
Let me also note that, as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and — and killing bad guys, important as that is.	0
We're also going to have to have a far more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.	0
We haven't done that yet.	0
We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the — the record.	0
You look at the record of the last four years and say, is Iran closer to a bomb?	0
Yes.	0
Is the Middle East in tumult?	0
Yes.	0
Is — is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?	0
No.	0
Is — are Israel and the Palestinians closer to — to reaching a peace agreement?	0
No, they haven't had talks in two years.	0
We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.	0
Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.	0
We've created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism — in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.	0
And what we've also done is engage these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their government aren't corrupt, to make sure that they are treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown, and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.	0
So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries and we have stood on the side of democracy.	0
One thing I think Americans should be proud of — when Tunisians began to protest, this nation, me, my administration stood with them earlier than just about any other country.	0
In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.	0
In Libya we stood on the side of the people.	0
And as a consequence there is no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.	0
But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.	0
And we want to shrink those groups and those networks, and we can do that, but we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.	0
The truth, though, is that al-Qaida is much weaker than it was when I came into office, and they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	0
Let's go to the next segment because it's a very important one.	0
It is the rise of China and future challenges for America.	0
I want to just begin this by asking both of you — and Mr. President, you go first this time — what do you believe is the greatest future threat to the national security of this country?	0
Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.	0
We have to remain vigilant, as I just said.	0
But with respect to China, China's both an adversary but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.	0
So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.	0
And I know Americans had — had seen jobs being shipped overseas, businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.	0
And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.	0
That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other — the previous administration had done in two terms.	0
And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that — that has been decided.	0
In fact, just recently, steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest, Pennsylvania, are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.	0
We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires — or — or — or cheap Chinese tires.	0
And we put a stop to it and, as a consequence, saved jobs throughout America.	0
I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case, said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.	0
But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.	0
They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.	0
Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking — taking care of business here at home.	0
If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to — to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.	0
And unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.	0
All right.	0
Governor.	0
Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.	0
It's not government investments that make businesses grow and hire people.	0
Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat, is a nuclear Iran.	0
Let's talk about China.	0
China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.	0
They don't want war.	0
They don't want to see protectionism.	0
They don't want to see the — the world break out into — into various forms of chaos, because they have to — they have to manufacture goods and put people to work.	0
And they have about 20,000 — 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year, coming into the cities, needing jobs.	0
So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.	0
And so we can be a partner with China.	0
We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.	0
We can work with them.	0
We can collaborate with them if they're willing to be responsible.	0
Now, they look at us and say, is it a good idea to be with America?	0
How strong are we going to be?	0
How strong is our economy?	0
They look at the fact that we owe them a trillion dollars and owe other people 16 trillion (dollars) in total, including them.	0
They — they look at our — our decision to — to cut back on our military capabilities — a trillion dollars.	0
The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	0
It's not my term.	0
It's the president's own secretary of defense called them devastating.	0
They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening and they say, well, OK, is America going to be strong?	0
And the answer is yes.	0
If I'm president, America will be very strong.	0
We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.	0
I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.	0
It holds down the prices of their goods.	0
It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.	0
That's got to end.	0
They're making some progress; they need to make more.	0
That's why on day one I will label them a currency manipulator which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.	0
They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.	0
They have to understand, we want to trade with them, we want a world that's stable, we like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.	0
Well, Governor, let me just ask you, if you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people are saying you're just going to start a trade war with China on day one.	0
Is that — isn't there a risk that that could happen?	0
Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year.	0
And we sell them about this much stuff every year.	0
So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.	0
And there's one going on right now that we don't know about.	0
It's a silent one and they're winning.	0
We have an enormous trade imbalance with China.	0
And it's worse this year than last year.	0
And it was worse last year than the year before.	0
And — and so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and — and lose jobs year in and year out.	0
We have to say to our friends in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively, we understand it, but — but this can't keep on going.	0
You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even into the United States.	0
I was with one company that makes valves in — in process industries.	0
And they said, look, we were — we were having some valves coming in that — that were broken, and we had to repair them under warranty.	0
And we looked them up, and — and they had our serial number on them.	0
And then we noticed that — that there was more than one with that same serial number.	0
They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging.	0
These were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.	0
This can't go on.	0
I want a great relationship with China.	0
China can be our partner.	0
But — but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.	0
Well, Governor Romney's right.	0
You are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas, because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.	1
And, you know, that's your right.	0
I mean, that's how our free market works.	0
But I've made a different bet on American workers.	0
You know, if we had taken your advice, Governor Romney, about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.	0
If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that are in profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes, now, that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs.	0
The problem is they won't be here; they'll be in places like China.	0
And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the lead in things like clean energy technology.	0
Now, with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled, since I came into office, to China.	0
And actually, currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.	0
We absolutely have to make more progress, and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.	0
And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.	0
And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power, that we are going to have a presence there.	0
We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through, that commerce continues.	0
And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.	0
That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.	0
That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.	0
I just want to take one of those points.	0
Again, attacking me is not talking about an agenda for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.	0
But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.	0
Nothing could be further from the truth.	0
I'm a son of Detroit.	0
I was born in Detroit.	0
My dad was head of a car company.	0
I like American cars.	0
And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.	0
My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.	0
It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.	0
I disagree with that.	0
I said they need — these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy, and in that process they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd — they'd built up.	0
And fortunately the president picked --	0
Governor Romney, that's not what you said.	0
Fortunately, the president — you can take — you can take a look at the op-ed.	0
Governor, you did not --	0
You can take a look at the op-ed.	0
You did not say that you would provide, Governor, help.	0
You know, I'm — I'm still speaking.	0
I said that we would provide guarantees and — and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.	0
Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.	0
And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry — of course not.	0
Of course not.	0
Let's check the record.	0
That's the height of silliness.	0
Let's — let's check the record.	0
I have never said I would — I would liquidate the industry.	0
I want to keep the industry growing and thriving.	0
Governor, the people in Detroit don't forget.	0
And — and that's I have the kind of commitment to make sure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.	0
We in this country can compete successfully with anyone in the world.	0
And we're going to.	0
We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in — in car companies like Tesla and — and Fisker, making electric battery cars — this is not research, Mr. President.	0
These are the government investing in companies, investing in Solyndra.	0
This is a company.	0
This isn't basic research.	0
I — I want to invest in research.	0
Research is great.	0
Providing funding to universities and think tanks — great.	0
But investing in companies?	0
Absolutely not.	0
That's the wrong way to go.	0
Governor, the fact of the matter is --	0
I'm still speaking.	0
Well — (chuckles) --	0
So I want to make sure that we make — we make America more competitive --	0
Yeah.	0
— and that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.	0
But your investing in companies doesn't do that.	0
In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here --	0
All right, Governor --	0
— because the private sector's not going to invest in a — in a — in a solar company if --	0
I'm happy — I'm — I'm — I'm happy to respond --	0
— if you're investing government money and someone else's.	0
You've held the floor for a while.	0
The — look, I think anybody out there can check the record.	0
Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know, airbrush history here.	0
You were very clear that you would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies even if they went through bankruptcy.	1
You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.	0
That wasn't true.	0
They would have gone through a --	0
You're wrong.	0
You're wrong, Mr. President.	0
I — no, I am not wrong.	0
You're wrong.	0
I am not wrong.	0
And --	0
People can look it up.	0
You're right.	0
People will look it up.	0
Good.	0
But more importantly, it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now.	0
Cutting our education budget — that's not a smart choice.	0
That will not help us compete with China.	0
Cutting our investments in research and technology — that's not a smart choice.	0
That will not help us compete with China.	0
Bringing down (sic) our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military's not asking for before we even get to the debt that we currently have — that is not going to make us more competitive.	0
Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.	0
Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States — that will not make us more competitive.	0
And — and the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.	0
What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.	0
And that's why we have to move forward and not go back.	0
I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	0
The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle-income families, now down $4,300 during your term, 23 million Americans still struggling to find a good job.	1
When you came into office, 32 million people on food stamps — today 47 million people on food stamps.	0
When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt — now $16 trillion in debt.	0
It hasn't worked.	0
You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	0
We're 9 million jobs short of that.	0
I've met some of those people.	0
I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.	0
I — I met a young woman in — in — in Philadelphia who's coming out of — out of college, can't find work.	0
I've been — Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.	0
It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last four years have been so hard.	0
And that — and that's why it's so critical that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy.	0
And that's not going to happen by — by just hiring teachers.	0
Look, I — I love to — I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers, do that.	0
I — by the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its way deeper and deeper into — into our schools.	0
Let the states and localities do that.	0
I was a governor.	0
The federal government didn't hire our teachers.	0
Governor --	0
But I love teachers.	0
But I want to get our private sector growing, and I know how to do it.	0
I think we all love teachers.	0
(Laughter.)	0
Gentlemen, thank you so much for a very vigorous debate.	0
We have come to the end.	0
It is time for closing statements.	0
I believe you're first, Mr. President.	0
Well, thank you very much Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.	0
You know, you've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials.	0
(Laughter.)	0
And now you've got a choice.	0
You know, over the last four years, we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	0
And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies: a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless; economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.	0
And I've got a different vision for America.	0
I want to build on our strengths.	0
And I put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here not overseas.	0
I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world and we're retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	0
I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas, but also the energy sources of the future.	0
Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need, but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.	0
As commander in chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.	0
But after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our veterans who've sacrificed so much for our freedom.	0
You know, we've been through tough times, but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together.	0
And if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices, I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.	0
Thank you.	0
Governor.	0
Thank you, Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University — good to be with you.	0
I'm optimistic about the future.	0
I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.	0
I want to see peace.	0
I want to see growing peace in this country, it's our objective.	0
We have an opportunity to have real leadership.	0
America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace that'll make a world the safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.	0
I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.	0
And there are two very different paths the country can take.	0
One is a path represented by the president, which, at the end of four years, would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt, heading towards Greece.	0
I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.	0
I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	0
The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.	0
I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	0
I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps not by cutting the program but by getting them good jobs.	0
America's going to come back.	0
And for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	0
I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	0
I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.	0
We've got to do that in Washington.	0
Washington is broken.	0
I know what it takes to get this country back.	0
And we'll work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.	0
This nation is the hope of the earth.	0
We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the Greatest Generation.	0
They've held a torch for the world to see, the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.	0
Now it's our turn to take that torch.	0
I'm convinced we'll do it.	0
We need strong leadership.	0
I'd like to be that leader, with your support.	0
I'll work with you.	0
I'll lead you in an open and honest way.	0
And I ask for your vote.	0
I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation, and to make sure that we all together maintain America as the hope of the earth.	0
Thank you so much.	0
Gentlemen, thank you both so much.	0
That brings an end to this year's debates.	0
And we want to thank Lynn University and its students for having us.	0
As I always do at the end of these debates, I leave you with the words of my mom who said, go vote.	0
It makes you feel big and strong.	0
That's great.	0
Good night.	0
Thank you.	0
(Inaudible.)	0
Morning.	0
Thanks for being here.	0
We are now nine away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States.	0
It's an opportunity to be here today to allow the president-elect to take your questions.	0
After the president-elect makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D.C., with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will -- who structured the agreements pursuant to the president's business arrangements and she will give brief remarks.	0
Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night.	0
It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.	0
According to BuzzFeed's own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report.	0
"The executive editor of The New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, ""Totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet."""	0
The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks.	0
The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple.	0
One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign.	0
These three individuals; Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen and Carter Page.	0
Carter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign.	0
Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time.	0
We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.	0
In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague.	0
A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at -- at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game.	0
One report now suggested apparently it's another Michael Cohen.	0
For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful.	0
With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence.	0
[Applause]	0
We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America.	0
[Applause]	0
I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again.	0
[Applause]	0
Now, the president-elect's leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive.	0
But as the chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring.	0
To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet.	0
Nineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a -- it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward.	0
Perhaps that's why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.	0
You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be.	0
But with freedom comes responsibility.	0
And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it.	0
[Applause]	0
But today, we'll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again.	0
And we'll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.	0
So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you very much.	0
It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis.	1
I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it's good to be with you.	0
We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that -- and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies?	0
Who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that.	0
A tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released.	0
But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years -- a couple in particular -- and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.	0
So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room.	0
I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that.	0
But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional -- so incredibly professional, that I've just gone up a notch as to what I think of you.	0
OK?	0
All right.	0
We've had some great news over the last couple of weeks.	0
I've been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country.	0
A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies -- big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest.	0
You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country.	0
Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.	0
I appreciate that from Ford.	0
I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler.	0
I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be.	0
I think a lot of people will be following.	0
I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.	0
We've got to get our drug industry back.	0
Our drug industry has been disastrous.	0
They're leaving left and right.	0
They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent.	0
And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder.	0
Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs.	0
We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.	0
And we're going to do that with a lot of other industries.	0
I'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F--35, you've been reading about it.	0
And it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.	0
I don't like that.	0
And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic.	0
I've really gotten to know them well.	0
And we're going to do some big things on the F--35 program, and perhaps the F--18 program.	0
And we're going to get those costs way down and we're going to get the plane to be even better.	0
And we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing.	0
So, we've been very, very much involved, and other things.	0
We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here.	0
There are no -- they're going to do tremendous things -- tremendous things in this country.	0
And they're very excited.	0
And I will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here.	0
They would not be in my office.	0
They would not be in anybody else's office.	0
They'd be building and doing things in other countries.	0
So, there's a great spirit going on right now.	0
A spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever.	0
We're going to create jobs.	0
I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.	0
And I mean that, I really -- I'm going to work very hard on that.	0
We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job.	0
And I'm very proud of what we've done.	0
And we haven't even gotten there yet.	0
I look very much forward to the inauguration.	0
It's going to be a beautiful event.	0
We have great talent, tremendous talent.	0
And we have the -- all of the bands -- or most of the bands are from the different -- from the different segments of the military.	0
And I've heard some of these bands over the years, they're incredible.	0
We're going to have a very, very elegant day.	0
The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful.	0
And I think we're going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.	0
It's a movement like the world has never seen before.	0
It's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect.	0
And even the polls -- although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't.	0
And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour in.	0
And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated.	0
And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they're gonna have a lot of security.	0
They're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans.	0
And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin.	0
And we'll do a news release in a little while.	0
Tell you about David, he's fantastic -- he's fantastic.	0
He will do a truly great job.	0
One of the commitments I made is that we're gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans.	0
Our veterans have been treated horribly.	0
They're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor.	0
By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal.	0
Not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen.	0
So, David is going to do a fantastic job.	0
We're going to be talking to a few people also to help David.	0
And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have.	0
And we're gonna set up a -- a group.	0
These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line.	0
And they're going to get together with their great doctors -- Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved.	0
Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business.	0
And we're gonna straighten out the V.A.	0
for our veterans.	0
I've been promising that for a long time and it's something I feel very, very strongly.	0
So, you'll get the information on David.	0
And I think you'll be very impressed with the job he does.	0
We looked long and hard.	0
We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good.	0
But we had a lot of talent.	0
And we think this election will be something that will, with time -- with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good 'cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly.	0
OK, questions?	0
Yes, John?	0
Thanks so much.	0
Thank you.	0
Appreciate it.	0
A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we're looking for further clarification on.	0
Sure.	0
First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations?	0
And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC?	0
And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States?	0
OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified.	0
So, I'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting.	0
And -- but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us.	0
And I will say, again, I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out.	0
I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting.	0
It's all fake news.	0
It's phony stuff.	0
It didn't happen.	0
And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people.	0
It was a group of opponents that got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap together.	0
So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it.	0
It should have never been -- number one, shouldn't have even entered paper.	0
But it should have never have been released.	0
But I read what was released and I think it's a disgrace.	0
I think it's an absolute disgrace.	0
As far as hacking, I think it was Russia.	0
But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.	0
And I -- I can say that you know when -- when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that.	0
That was something that was extraordinary.	0
That was probably China.	0
We had -- we had much hacking going on.	0
And one of the things we're gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled.	0
You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world -- they were never in the same room together as a group.	0
And we're gonna put those minds together and we're going to form a defense.	0
And I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked.	0
They did a very poor job.	0
They could've had hacking defense, which we had.	0
And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.	0
And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.	1
We have to do that for our country.	0
It's very important.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
... just to the last part of that question how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President Putin?	0
Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news.	0
They said it totally never happened.	0
"Now, somebody would say, ""Oh, of course he's gonna say that."""	0
I respected the fact that he said that.	0
And I -- I'll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would've released it; they would've been glad to release it.	0
I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would've released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her.	0
I mean what he said about her was horrible.	0
If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would've fired him immediately or that person.	0
Because what he said about her was horrible.	0
But remember this	0
That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it?	0
That's a horrible thing.	0
That's a horrible thing.	0
Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate -- it would've been the biggest story in the history of stories.	0
"And they would've said immediately, ""You have to get out of the race."""	0
Nobody even talked about it.	0
It's a very terrible thing.	0
Yeah?	0
Can I ask you a question, sir?	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Thank you, Mr. President-elect.	0
On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election.	0
Do you accept that part of the finding?	0
And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place?	0
Well, if -- if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia.	0
Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky.	0
I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time.	1
The void was created, ISIS was formed.	0
If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks?	0
That's called an asset, not a liability.	0
Now, I don't know that I'm gonna get along with Vladimir Putin.	0
I hope I do.	0
But there's a good chance I won't.	0
And if I don't, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me?	0
Does anybody in this room really believe that?	0
Give me a break.	0
OK?	0
[Crosstalk]	0
... President Obama...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
... make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies?	0
Lemme just tell you what I do.	0
When I leave our country, I'm a very high-profile person, would you say?	0
I am extremely careful.	0
I'm surrounded by bodyguards.	0
I'm surrounded by people.	0
"And I always tell them -- anywhere, but I always tell them if I'm leaving this country, ""Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras."""	0
I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.	0
"And number one, ""I hope you're gonna be good anyway."	0
But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places.	0
Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know.	0
"You better be careful, or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television."""	0
I tell this to people all the time.	0
I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well -- Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.	0
"And I told many people, ""Be careful, because you don't wanna see yourself on television."	0
"Cameras all over the place."""	0
And again, not just Russia, all over.	0
Does anyone really believe that story?	0
I'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me.	0
[LAUGHTER]	0
LaughterCrosstalk]	0
... how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business.	0
But first, I have to follow-up on some of these Russian remarks.	0
Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified?	0
Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise?	0
And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?	0
So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia.	0
I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away.	0
And I have no loans with Russia.	0
As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt.	0
I have assets that are -- and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt -- I have very low debt.	0
But I have no loans with Russia at all.	0
And I thought that was important to put out.	0
I certified that.	0
So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings.	0
We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict.	0
So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals.	0
Now, I have to say one other thing.	0
Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy.	0
And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai -- a number of deals and I turned it down.	0
I didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president, which is -- I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have.	1
But I don't want to take advantage of something.	0
I have something that others don't have, Vice President Pence also has it.	0
I don't think he'll need it, I have a feeling he's not going to need it.	0
But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president.	0
It was many, many years old, this is for presidents.	0
Because they don't want presidents getting -- I understand they don't want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country.	0
So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.	1
I don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to.	0
I would be the only one to be able to do that.	0
You can't do that in any other capacity.	0
But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company -- the country.	1
I'd do a very good job, but I don't want to do that.	0
Now, all of these papers that you see here -- yes, go ahead.	0
...do you believe the hacking was justified?	0
And will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in Russia?	0
I'm not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they're under audit.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
But every president since the '70's has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir...	1
You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK?	1
They're the only who ask.	0
You don't think the American public is concerned about it?	0
No I don't think so.	0
I won, when I became president.	0
No, I don't think they care at all.	0
I don't think they care at all.	0
[Applause]	0
I think you care -- I think you care.	0
First of all, you learn very little to a tax return.	1
What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers.	0
And actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought.	0
We're in many, many countries, and I'm very proud of it.	0
And what I'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company.	0
They are going to be running it in a very professional manner.	0
They're not going to discuss it with me.	0
Again, I don't have to do this.	0
They're not going to discuss it with me.	0
And with that, I'm going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she's going to go -- these papers are just some of the many documents that I've signed turning over complete and total control to my sons.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Good morning.	0
It's my honor and privilege to be here today at President-elect Trump's request.	0
He's asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he's taking.	0
As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president.	0
But at that time, no one was so concerned.	0
President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people's business and not his own.	0
To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.	0
He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.	0
As he said, he's voluntarily taking this on.	0
The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets.	0
The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it's simply inapplicable by its terms.	0
And this is not just our interpretation.	0
It's Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president.	0
Even so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests.	0
He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit.	0
He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.	0
Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him.	0
He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W.	0
Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.	0
Mr.	0
Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan.	0
He's here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization.	0
I'm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking.	0
First, President-elect Trump's investments and business assets commonly known as the -- as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th.	0
Here is just some of the paperwork that's taking care of those actions.	0
Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg.	0
Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.	0
Further, at the president-elect's direction, the trust agreement provides -- that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team.	0
The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.	0
President-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency.	0
President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.	0
Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization.	0
As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.	0
The president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments.	0
As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets.	0
Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics.	0
Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with.	0
Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods.	0
Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a--Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.	0
Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust -- President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated.	0
This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016.	0
As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.	0
The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals.	0
No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump's presidency.	0
New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.	0
The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV.	0
Because any new deal could -- and I emphasize could -- be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.	0
The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts.	0
Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.	0
To further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights.	0
Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole.	0
There will be no separate business by business accounting.	0
Another step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.	0
He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump's role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.	0
In sum, all of these actions -- complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights -- will sever President-elect Trump's presidency from the Trump Organization.	0
Some have asked questions.	0
Why not divest?	0
Why not just sell everything?	0
Form of blind trust.	0
And I'd like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.	0
Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest.	0
In fact, it would exacerbate them.	0
The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization's assets.	0
If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.	0
Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny.	0
Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect.	0
And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.	0
President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built.	0
This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn't even feasible.	0
Some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children.	0
This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated.	0
And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.	0
Some people have suggested that the Trump -- that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company.	0
Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter.	0
It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.	0
Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses.	0
President Trump can't unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized.DILLON	0
I'm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments.	0
That's a word I think we've all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before.	0
And we're gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.	0
Emoluments comes from the Constitution.	0
"The Constitution says ""officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office."""	0
The so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder.	0
No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument.	0
Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.	0
But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms.	0
They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm's-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn't even aware of.	0
These people are wrong.	0
This is not what the Constitution says.	0
Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office.	1
It's not an emolument.	1
The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here.	0
But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.	0
So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury.	0
This way, it is the American people who will profit.	0
In sum, I and president-elect's other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we've outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.	0
We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect's desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.	0
The American people were well -- well aware of President-elect Trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted.	0
Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.	0
President-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
[Crosstalk]	0
You're welcome.	0
My pleasure.	0
Yes.	0
Don't want to lose your note.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Here you go.	0
Thank you.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Thank you.	0
Mr. Trump, from America News.	0
What is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest? And do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your -- your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
I -- I really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening in -- I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson.	0
I think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying.	0
I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general.	0
And he was brilliant.	0
And what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama.	0
And he was brilliant yesterday.	0
So, I really think that they are -- I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together.	0
And we've been hearing that from so many people.	0
People are so happy.	0
You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil.	0
When there was a find, he would get it.	0
When they needed something, he would be there.	0
A friend of mine who's very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm -- big supporter -- he said there's nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson.	0
And that's what we want.	0
That's what I want to bring to government.	0
I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind.	0
We don't make good deals any more.	0
I say it all the time in speeches.	0
We don't make good deals anymore; we make bad deals.	0
Our trade deals are a disaster.	0
So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they're smart.	0
And that's what I'd put, I'm very proud of the Cabinet, I think they're doing very well.	0
It's very interesting how it's going, but it's -- I think they're doing very, very well.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
... a quick follow-up on -- on Russia, sir.	0
Thank you, Mr. President-elect.	0
I wanted to ask a few questions on Obamacare?	0
Yeah. Can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Finally, Obamacare, I thought it was never gonna be asked.	0
...though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law?	0
You're gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you're gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care.	0
Obamacare is a complete and total disaster.	0
They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you.	0
In some cases, they guide you incorrectly.	0
In most cases, you realize what's happened, it's imploding as we sit.	0
Some states have over a hundred percent increase and '17 and I said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year.	1
It's going to be catastrophic.	0
Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't be fair to the people.	0
We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare.	0
We don't wanna own it, we don't wanna own it politically.	0
They own it right now.	0
So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in '17 and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time.	0
We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.	0
It'll be repeal and replace.	0
It will be essentially, simultaneously.	0
It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.	0
So we're gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff.	0
And we're gonna get a health bill passed, we're gonna get health care taken care of in this country.	0
You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high.	0
Obamacare is the Democrats problem.	0
We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them.	0
We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it.	0
We could sit back and let them hang with it.	0
We are doing the Democrats a great service.	0
So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan.	0
And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times.	0
And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
President-elect, can we just ask you -- sir, sir... President-elect Trump...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Mr. President -- which one?	0
I was going right here.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
President-elect Trump, Jon Steinberg from Cheddar.	0
When you look at all the meetings that you've had with Carrier, SoftBank and Alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce?	0
And then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts?	0
Well, if I can save jobs, for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well, that's only one company, like we did a good job with Carrier.	0
And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.	1
And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot.	0
But those were -- that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it's always tough when they're building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.	0
You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going to build that plant in Mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making, and you're going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border -- not a weak border like it is -- we don't even have a border.	0
It's an open sieve.	0
But you're going to sell through a very strong border -- not going to happen.	0
You're going to pay a very large border tax.	0
So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina.	0
You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan.	0
You can do anywhere -- you've got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition.	0
So it's not like, oh, gee, I'm taking the competition away.	0
You've got a lot of places you can move.	0
And I don't care, as along as it's within the United States, the borders of the United States.	0
There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder.	0
And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago.	0
And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are -- 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get.	1
You know that story.	0
The real number -- that's the real number.	0
So, that's the way it is.	0
OK. Go ahead.	0
President-elect, I have a question about the Supreme Court and border security.	0
But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning.	0
Are we living in Nazi Germany?	0
What were you driving at there?	0
Do you have a problem with the intelligence community?	0
And on the Supreme Court, what's your timeline?	0
You said a while ago you were down to four.	0
Have you conducted those interviews yet?	0
What's your timeline for nominating?	0
And on the border fence, it now appears clear U.S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front.	0
What is your plan to...	0
That's not clear at all. OK.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
... to get Mexico to pay for it?	0
I've got it.	0
Do you have any more?	0
[LAUGHTER]	0
On the fence -- it's not a fence.	0
It's a wall.	0
You just misreported it.	0
We're going to build a wall.	0
I could wait about a year-and-a--half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don't want to wait.	0
Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin.	0
I don't feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a--half.	0
We're going to start building.	0
Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall.	0
That will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment -- probably less likely that it's a payment.	0
But it will happen.	0
So, remember this, OK?	0
I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy.	0
I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall?	0
And people would all scream out -- 25,000, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had.	0
You know that.	0
You don't like to report that, but that's OK.	0
OK, now he agrees.	0
Finally, he agrees.	0
But I say who is going to pay for the wall?	0
"And they will scream out, ""Mexico."""	0
Now, reports went out last week -- oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement.	0
What's the difference?	0
I want to get the wall started.	0
I don't want to wait a year-and-a--half until I make my deal with Mexico.	0
And we probably will have a deal sooner than that.	0
And by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice.	0
I respect the government of Mexico.	0
I respect the people of Mexico.	0
I love the people of Mexico.	0
I have many people from Mexico working for me.	0
They're phenomenal people.	0
The government of Mexico is terrific.	0
I don't blame them for what's happened.	0
I don't blame them for taking advantage of the United States.	0
I wish our politicians were so smart.	0
Mexico has taken advantage of the United States.	0
I don't blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico.	0
What I say is we shouldn't have allowed that to happen.	0
It's not going to happen anymore.	0
So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed.	0
OK?	0
Supreme Court judge.	0
So, as you know, I have a list of 20.	0
I've gone through them.	0
We've met with numerous candidates.	0
They're outstanding in every case.	0
They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society.	0
Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he's a fantastic guy.	0
That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we're having a big church service and lots of good things are happening.	0
So our first day -- and you'll all be invited to the signings, but we'll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week.	0
And you're all invited.	0
But on the Supreme Court, I'll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in.	0
I think it's one of the reasons I got elected.	0
I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected.	0
The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany, what were you driving at there?	0
What are you trying to tell the American public?	0
I think it was disgraceful -- disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out.	0
I think it's a disgrace, and I say that -- and I say that, and that's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do.	0
I think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public.	0
As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they're going to suffer the consequences.	0
They already are.	0
And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up -- and by the way, we just found out I was coming down.	0
Michael Cohen -- I was being -- Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer.	0
He's a good lawyer in my firm.	0
It was just reported that it wasn't this Michael Cohen they we're talking about.	0
So all night long it's Michael Cohen.	0
"I said, ""I want to see your passport."""	0
He brings his passport to my office.	0
I say, hey, wait a minute.	0
He didn't leave the country.	0
He wasn't out of the country.	0
They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague.	0
It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen.	0
It's a disgrace what took place.	0
It's a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen.	0
Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?	0
Mr. President-elect --	0
Go ahead.	0
Mr. President-elect, since you are attacking our news organization...	0
Not you.	0
Can you give us a chance?	0
Your organization is terrible.	0
You are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir?	0
Sir, can you...	0
Quiet.	0
Mr. President-elect, can you say...	0
He's asking a question, don't be rude.	0
Don't be rude.	0
Can you give us a question since you're attacking us?	0
Can you give us a question?	0
Don't be rude.	0
No, I'm not going to give you a question.	0
I'm not going to give you a question.	0
Can you state...	0
You are fake news.	0
Go ahead.	0
Sir, can you state categorically that nobody -- no, Mr. President-elect, that's not appropriate.	0
Go ahead.	0
[Applause]	0
Do you think President Obama went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the hacking?	0
I don't think he went too far.	0
No.	0
Will you roll them back?	0
What do you think of Lindsey Graham's plan to send you a bill for...	0
Plans to send me a bill for what?	0
Tougher sanctions.	0
I hadn't heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that.	0
Lindsey Graham.	0
I've been competing with him for a long time.	0
He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day.	0
I didn't realize Lindsey Graham still had it.	0
That's all right.	0
I think Lindsey Graham is a nice guy.	0
I've heard that he is a nice guy and I've been hearing it.	0
Go ahead.	0
Go ahead.	0
You've been waiting.	0
As far as we understand, the intelligence community...	0
Stand up.	0
From BBC news.	0
Ian Pannell from BBC news.	0
BBC news.	0
That's another beauty.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
As far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it.	0
If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position...	0
There's nothing they could come back with.	0
Can you...	0
Go ahead.	0
...published fake news and all the problems that we've seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here?	0
Well, I don't recommend reforms.	0
I recommend people that are -- that have some moral compass.	0
You know, I've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things.	0
But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody.	0
I could name them, but I won't bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us.	0
They're very, very dishonest people, but I think it's just something we're going to have to live with.	0
Yes?	0
[Crosstalk]	0
I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the U.S. intelligence community.	0
And be very clear about what you're saying.	0
Do you trust your U.S. intelligence officials?	0
And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community?	0
Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important.	0
We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo and others, you know the Senator Dan Coats.	0
We're going to be putting in some outstanding people.	0
Within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking.	0
I want them to cover this situation.	0
I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly -- because we're hacked by everybody -- you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it's number 17, in terms of protection.	0
If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries -- they put this in the category of an industry -- the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say, hacking defense.	0
Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee.	0
That's why we weren't hacked.	0
By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren't able to hack.	0
And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense.	0
The Democratic National Committee didn't do that.	0
Maybe that's why the country runs so badly that way.	0
But I will tell you -- wait -- wait -- wait, let me finish.	0
Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena -- fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody.	0
That includes Russia and China and everybody -- everybody. OK.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Go ahead -- go ahead.	0
Mr. President-elect, you said, just now, that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podesta's e-mails, et cetera.	0
All right, but you know what, it could have been others also.	0
But why did you spend weeks undermining U.S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?	0
Well, I think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press.	0
I think it's pretty sad.	0
First of all, it's illegal.	0
You know, these are -- these are classified and certified meetings and reports.	0
I'll tell you what does happen.	0
I have many meetings with intelligence.	0
And every time I meet, people are reading about it.	0
Somebody's leaking it out.	0
So, there's -- maybe it's my office.	0
Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people.	0
Maybe it's them.	0
And what I did is I said I won't tell anybody.	0
I'm going to have a meeting and I won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.	0
And what happened is I had my meeting.	0
Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know -- I didn't tell her.	0
Nobody knew.	0
The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left.	0
And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.	0
So, I don't want that -- I don't want that.	0
It's very unfair to the country.	0
It's very unfair to our country; what's happened.	0
That report should have never -- first of all, it shouldn't have been printed because it's not worth the paper it's written on.	0
And I thank the New York Times for saying that.	0
I thank a lot of different people for saying that.	0
But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Thank you, Mr. President-elect, can you stand here today, once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign.	0
And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now?	0
He shouldn't be doing it.	0
He won't be doing it.	0
Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I'm leading than when other people have led it.	0
You will see that.	0
Russia will respect our country more.	0
He shouldn't have done it.	0
I don't believe that he will be doing it more now.	0
We have to work something out, but it's not just Russia.	0
Take a look at what's happened.	0
You don't report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China.	0
And that's because we have no defense.	0
That's because we're run by people that don't know what they're doing.	0
But Russia and other countries -- and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total.	0
Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.	0
I want to thank everybody.	0
So this is all -- just so you understand, these papers -- because I'm not sure that was explained properly.	0
But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I'll come back and say, oh, you did a good job.	0
"Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I'll say, ""You're fired."""	0
Good-bye, everybody.	0
Good-bye.	0
We're live here at the University of Houston for the 10th Republican presidential debate.	0

The final debate before Super Tuesday begins right after this quick break.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the University of Houston and the Republican presidential debate.	0
The candidates, they are now in place.	0
Their positions were selected based on their standing in the delegate race through Nevada, with the top candidate in the center and the others extending outward.	0
I want to tell you how tonight's debate will work.	0
As moderator, I will guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups, as will Maria Celeste, Dana Bash and Hugh Hewitt.	0
Candidates, you'll have a minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.	0
We have timing lights that are visible to the candidates.	0
Those lights will warn you when your time is up, and as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
We know you all want to jump and debate these critically important issues, but please wait until you're called on.	0
These are the rules all of the candidates have agreed to.	0
It's time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now.	0
You'll each have 30 seconds.	0
Dr. Carson, you're first.	0
If someone had tried to describe today's America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief.	0
Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.	0
Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other.	0
What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight.	0
It's not about us, it's about the American people.	0

Governor Kasich?	0
Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother's mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English.	0
And I'm standing on this stage.	0
It's pretty remarkable.	0
But I want to tell you, there's a lot of young people watching tonight.	0
You can do whatever you want to do in your life.	0
America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight.	0
So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them.	0
Shoot for the stars.	0
America's great, and you can do it.	0
Thank you, Wolf.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio?	0
Well, thank you.	0
This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.	0
Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.	0
Bush began the Reagan Revolution.	0
For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense.	0
But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams.	0
Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.	0
I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz?	0
Welcome to Texas.	0
[ applause ]	0
Here, Texas provided my family with hope.	0
Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college.	0
Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas.	0
I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here.	0
When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.	0
And, I'll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn't vote for you, but you're doing what you said you would do.	0
And, as president, I will do the same.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump.	0
Thank you.	0
My whole theme is make America great again.	0
We don't win anymore as a country.	0
We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military.	0
ISIS, we can't even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me.	0
We will.	0
We don't win in any capacity with healthcare.	0
We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced.	0
We just don't win.	0
You look at our borders, they're like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.	0
We're going to make a great country again.	0
We're going to start winning again.	0
We're going to win a lot, it's going to be a big difference, believe me.	0
It's going to be a big difference.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you very much.	0
It's now time to begin questions.	0
Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday.	0
When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.	0
Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo.	0
So, that's where we begin.	0
Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.	0
"You've also promised to let what you call, ""the good ones"", come back in."	0
"Your words, ""the good ones"", after they've been deported."	0
Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in.	0
He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you.	0
He calls your plan amnesty.	0
Is it?	0
First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.	0
As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration.	1
It wouldn't even be a big subject.	1
But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country.	0
We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally.	0
They will go out.	0
They will come back — some will come back, the best, through a process.	0
They have to come back legally.	0
They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.	0
They're going to get in line with other people.	0
The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process.	0
[ applause ]	0
"Senator Cruz, what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, ""the good ones"" come back to the United States?"	0
You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country — our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs.	0
Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.	0
You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona.	0
Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there — it was a very interesting article.	0
Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing.	0
But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars.	0
And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise.	0
That's who we need to be fighting for.	0
Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that?	0
Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio?	0
Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's.	0
He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.	0
Are those claims correct?	0
Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this.	0
When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border.	0
And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays.	0
That's 45 percent of the problem right there.	0
It also has to do — that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth.	0
And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else.	0
And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.	0
And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate.	0
Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.	0
In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship.	0
In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.	0
And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.	0
My mom and dad — my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.	0
So I think this is an important issue.	0
And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out.	0
If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.	0
Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.	0
As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help.	0
It's the up season.	0
People didn't want to have part-time jobs.	0
There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.	0
Everybody agrees with me on that.	0
They were part-time jobs.	0
You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.	0
That — my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation.	0
You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.	0
And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.	0
I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election.	0
He should have won that election.	0
He had a failed president.	0
He ran a terrible campaign.	0
He was a terrible candidate.	0
That's what I criticize Mitt Romney — I mean, ran...	0
No, he...	0
Excuse me.	0
He ran one terrible campaign.	0
That's an election that should have been won.	0
[ applause ]	0
"Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term ""self-deportation."""	0
I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online.	0
But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point.	0
I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration.	0
This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.	0
But I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.	0
You hired some workers from Poland...	0
No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people.	0
You haven't hired anybody.	0
[ applause ]	0
In fact, some of the people...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
And by the way, I've hired — and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job.	0
You've hired nobody.	0
Yes, you've hired a thousand from another country...	0
You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera.	0
So don't tell me about that.	0
Let me just say — let me finish the statement.	0
This is important.	0
You haven't hired one person, you liar.	0
He hired workers from Poland.	0
And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...	0
That's wrong.	0
That's wrong.	0
Totally wrong.	0
That's a fact.	0
People can look it up.	0
I'm sure people are Googling it right now.	0
Look it up.	0
Trump Polish workers, you'll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects.	0
He did it.	0
[ applause ]	0
That happened.	0
I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.	0
Tens of thousands...	0
Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.	0
Be quiet.	0
Just be quiet.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me talk.	0
I've hired tens of thousands of people.	0
He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well.	0
Everybody was happy.	0
You paid a million dollars.	0
And by the way, the laws were totally different.	0
That was a whole different world.	0
Thank you.	0
But I've hired people.	0
Nobody up here has hired anybody.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States.	0
What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?	0
Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally.	0
U.S. citizens can come back.	0
That's existing law.	0
But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration.	0
I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall.	0
"And in 2013, when I was fight against the ""gang of eight"" amnesty bill, where was Donald?"	0
"He was firing Dennis Rodman on ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	0
[ laughter ]	0
"And indeed, if you look at the ""gang of eight,"" one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill."	0
If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans.	0
And when you're funding open border politicians, you shouldn't be surprised when they fight for open borders.	0
And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty.	0
And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record.	0
And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump?	0
I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years.	0
And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now — your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.	0
I've had an amazing relationship with politicians — with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman.	0
As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody.	0
I got along with everybody.	0
You get along with nobody.	0
You don't have one Republican — you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time.	0
These are minor details.	0
But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one.	0
You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people.	0
You should be ashamed of yourself.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz?	0
You know, I actually think Donald is right.	0
He is promising if he's elected he will go and cut deals in Washington.	0
And he's right.	0
He has supported — he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats.	0
Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be hiring illegal immigrants.	0
Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn't be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn't be funding the Gang of Eight.	0
And, you know, he is right.	0
When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let's actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn't like it.	0
And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that's not a good attribute for a president.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Here's a man — Robin Hood.	0
This is Robin Hood over here.	0
He talks about corruption.	0
On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation.	0
He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest.	0
He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks.	0
Give me a break.	0
All right.	0
We're going to move on to Governor Kasich.	0
Governor Kasich...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Wolf, can I respond to that attack?	0
You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in.	0
He's been waiting patiently.	0
"Governor Kasich, the idea — you've said this, and I want to quote you now: ""The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it."""	0
Those are your words.	0
Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them?	0
Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States.	0
He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem — a path to legalization.	0
You see, that was a time when things worked.	0
It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.	0
Look, I think there is an answer here.	0
The answer is you complete the border.	0
You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in.	0
If you come in, we don't want any excuse.	0
You're going to go back.	0
But I favor a guest worker program.	0
I think it's practical.	0
And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans — the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service.	0
And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship.	0
I don't think we're going to tear families apart.	0
I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes.	0
I don't think — first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.	0
You know what happened?	0
The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border.	0
And I think it was probably business interests that affected it.	0
But at the end of the day, let's be practical.	0
Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs.	0
With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again.	0
And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, you've been critical of mass deportation.	0
You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party.	0
Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?	0
I believe in liberty and justice for all.	0
I think everything that we do should be fair.	0
And I've already described — you know, how we can secure the border.	0
We need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily.	0
And we have to stop that.	0
But in terms of the people who are here already, after we — after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable.	0
And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.	0
They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore.	0
And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.	0
If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through.	0
I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.	0
And we have other ways of — of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here.	0
That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.	0
Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now.	0
You've said the Mexican government will pay for it.	0
Correct.	0
The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen.	0
The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen.	0
"In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox — he said today, and I'm quoting him — he said, ""I'm not going to pay for that,"" quote, ""effing wall."""	0
[ laughter ]	0
So if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?	0
I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.	0
[ applause ]	0
It just got 10 feet taller.	0
I saw him make that — I saw him make the statement.	0
I saw him use the word that he used.	0
I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.	0
This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK?	0
Number one.	0
Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year.	0
And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.	0
We're going to make them pay for that wall.	0
Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it.	0
If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion.	0
[ applause ]	0
But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion.	0
You need 1,000 — you need 1,000 miles.	0
The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago — 2,000, is 13,000 miles.	0
We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.	0
We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall.	0
This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at.	0
This is a wall that's going to work.	0
Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors.	0
They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
... immediately.	0
Mexico will pay for the wall.	0
It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.	0
[ applause ]	0
If the — if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?	0
Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth.	0
We're losing so much.	0
[ applause ]	0
We're losing so much with Mexico and China — with China, we're losing $500 billion a year.	0
"And then people say, ""don't we want to trade?"""	0
I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion.	0
I don't want to lose $58 billion.	0
Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners.	0
They just took Ford.	0
They're building a $2.5 billion plant.	0
They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.	0
And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way.	0
But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico.	0
They're taking our businesses.	0
I don't mind.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Rubio?	0
[ applause ]	0
Yeah, a couple points.	0
If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.	0
The second...	0
[ applause ]	0
Such a cute sound bite.	0
But it — no, it's not a sound bite.	0
It's a fact.	0
Again, go online and Google it.	0
Donald Trump, Polish workers.	0
You'll see it.	0
The second thing, about the trade war — I don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China.	0
So you're gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.	0
All right, you know what?	0
Why don't you make them in America?	0
Because they devalue their currency — they devalue their currencies...	0
Well, then make them in America.	0
... that makes it — well, you don't know a thing about business.	0
You lose on everything...	0
Well, make them in America.	0
Let me just tell you — they de-value their currency.	0
They de-value their currencies.	0
Well then, make them in America.	0
That makes it — well, you don't know a thing about business.	0
You lose on everything you do.	0
Well, make them in America.	0
Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies.	0
China, Mexico, everybody.	0
Japan with the cars.	0
They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...	0
And so you make them in China and in Russia.	0
But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.	0
Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies.	0
You've bankrupted..	0
No, I — and you know why?	0
You know why?	0
[ applause ]	0
I don't know anything about...	0
You know why?	0
... starting a university, and that was a fake university.	0
One at a time.	0
First of all...	0
One at a time.	0
... first of all, that's called a...	0
There are people who borrowed $36,000...	0
Hold on.	0
One at a time, Mr. Trump.	0
... to go to Trump University, and they're suing now — $36,000 to go to a university...	0
And by the way — and by the way...	0
... that's a fake school.	0
... and by the way...	0
And you know what they got?	0
They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...	0
...	0
I've won most of the lawsuits.	0
That's what they got for $36,000.	0
All right, I want to move on.	0
And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.	0
Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...	0
Most of the lawsuits.	0
...	0
I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.	0
Excuse me.	0
Hey Wolf, let me ask you.	0
Am I allowed to respond to this?	0
You're allowed — you've been responding.	0
OK. Well let — no, I haven't.	0
I really haven't.	0
[ laughter ]	0
He's talked through the whole thing.	0
[ applause ]	0
Here's a guy — here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed.	0
You tell me about this guy.	0
This is what we're going to have as president.	0
Here's a guy that inherited $200 million.	0
If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?	0
No, no, no.	0
Selling watches in Manhattan.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
I took...	0
That's where he would be.	0
That is so wrong.	0
We'll work on that.	0
I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.	0
Oh, OK. One million.	0
I borrowed $1 million...	0
Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.	0
I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...	0
Oh, he doesn't make that money.	0
... more than $10 billion.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
I want to bring in Maria Celeste Arrarás of Telemundo.	0
Maria?	0
Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.	0
Correct.	0
It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants.	0
This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I'm going to quote you	0
[ in Spanish ]	0
which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately.	0
So Senator Rubio, what changed?	0
It didn't change.	0
Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?	0
No, it's the same policy.	0
It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will — we will eliminate that executive order.	0
The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it.	0
And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 — someone who came here when they were 2 years old.	0
I understand.	0
I know people that are personally impacted by this.	0
The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional.	0
The president doesn't have the power to do that.	0
[ applause ]	0
And he himself admitted that.	0
Senator, Senator...	0
I'm sorry, but let me finish my...	0
... but you went — you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.	0
No, but this is not about deportation.	0
Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation.	0
This is about DACA.	0
DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional.	0
I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.	0
Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional.	0
No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English.	0
So in what sense did he lie?	0
Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA.	0
I am going to get rid of DACA.	0
In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point.	0
That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it.	0
And new people will not be able to apply.	0
In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.	0
That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away.	0
But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take — as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.	0
I have to say, he lied this time.	0
He lied.	0
100 percent.	0
100 percent.	0
You lied about the Polish workers.	0
Yes, yes, yes.	0
38 years ago.	0
You lied to the students at Trump University.	0
Let Senator Cruz jump in.	0
Oh, he lied 38 years ago.	0
All right, I guess there's a statute of limitation on lies.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you're right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that.	0
You know, we've both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program.	0
Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.	0
That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.	0
You know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies.	0
When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.	0
Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty.	0
Well, someday it should end, just not now.	0
And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.	0
That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol.	0
What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now.	0
By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away.	0
I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them.	0
And, again, you read the statement in Spanish.	0
I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is — at that time I was not a candidate for president.	0
I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it.	0
New applicants will not be able to apply.	0
That is the end of DACA.	0
I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage.	0
As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.	0
[ applause ]	0
And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other.	0
Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.	0
So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?	0
Well, Maria, you are right.	0
It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants.	0
It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.	0
You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal.	0
That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.	0
At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide.	0
And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community.	0
The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.	0
You know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country.	0
And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father's story.	0
Telling my Dad's story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream.	0
And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community.	0
It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.	0
I'm sorry I was mentioned...	0
...	0
Governor Kasich.	0
Maria I was mentioned in that.	0
I was mentioned in that statement.	0
Governor Kasich, after the...	0
... OK.	0
I was mentioned — just because of the hispanic — and I'll be brief.	0
A couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American.	0
We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.	0
Yes, it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it.	0
But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...and, you can only do that through free enterprise.	0
That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos.	0
"Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy report that concluded, and I'm going to quote it, ""if hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States they won't pay attention to our next sentence."""	0
So, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?	0
Well, I'm not going to talk about that.	0
I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates.	0
My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.	0
I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think.	0
I'm going to tell you what I think.	0
My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning.	0
I haven't changed anything with it.	0
And, look, my view is, we need economic growth.	0
Everything starts with economic growth.	0
And how do you get it?	0
Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.	0
That gives you economic growth.	0
I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.	0
But here's the thing that I believe.	0
Economic growth is not an end unto itself.	0
We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.	0
Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.	0
It's what Jack Kemp used to say.	0
A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats.	0
And you know what?	0
With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me.	0
And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.	0
It's time to solve problems.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?	0
I didn't hear the first part of the question?	0
The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.	0
And one of them was that they shouldn't feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.	0
OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.	0
And the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group.	0
You know, this is America.	0
And we need to have policies that are — that give liberty and justice to all people.	0
And that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that.	0
And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks.	0
We don't pick and choose winners and losers.	0
We are compassionate.	0
But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America.	0
When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race.	0
You keep saying that Hispanics love you.	0
True.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.	0
True.	0
But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you.	0
They don't like you.	0
Wouldn't that make you an unelectable...	0
No.	0
... candidate in a general election?	0
First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.	0
You used to say that you love...	0
[ laughter ]	0
Number one.	0
Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics.	0
They're incredible people.	0
They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.	0
I won with every single category.	0
I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics.	0
And I got 46 percent.	0
Nobody else was close.	0
Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.	0
They get it.	0
They're incredible people.	0
They're incredible workers.	0
They get it.	0
And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics.	0
I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll.	0
But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting — bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.	0
And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in.	0
We're getting record-setting numbers.	0
I think I have something to do with that.	0
We're getting record-setting numbers.	0
And I won every one — the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.	0
New people are coming into the Republican Party.	0
We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.	0
[ applause ]	0
For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past.	0
But it is not just a Telemundo poll.	0
We have...	0
I love them.	0
I love them.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Well, it's not the only poll.	0
They're fine.	0
Do you know what?	0
They're fine.	0
Just last night — let me — let me finish, please.	0
Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you.	0
And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 — let me finish please — of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.	0
Why did they take the poll?	0
Why did they...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I am making reference — I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.	0
I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics.	0
And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision.	0
It was settled.	0
We're good friends now.	0
It was all settled up.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Very happy, very happy.	0
Very good people.	0
I'm just telling you — I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics.	0
I will do better than anybody on this stage.	0
I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics.	0
But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.	0
Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue.	0
I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.	0
Hugh?	0
Thank you, Wolf.	0
To me, it's the most important issue.	0
I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.	0
Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?	0
Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it — Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election.	0
Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend.	0
And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance.	0
We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.	0
Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this — this stage.	0
In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists.	0
So I'm certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.	0
But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000.	0
Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want.	0
Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.	0
I've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.	0
I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court?	0
I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty.	0
Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies — all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a five-four decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills.	0
They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.	0
Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?	0
Yes, I would.	0
And I've been there.	0
And I've been there very strongly.	0
I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault.	0
It's not Ted's fault.	0
Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted.	0
Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare.	0
Might as well be called Roberts-care.	0
Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve.	0
And we ended up with Obamacare.	0
That is a rough thing.	0
And I know Ted feels badly about it.	0
And I think he probably still respects the judge.	0
But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way — no way that he should have approved Obamacare.	0
Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen.	0
But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.	0
Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?	0
Well, listen — Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts.	0
Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.	0
But I would not have nominated John Roberts.	0
I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals.	0
And I'll tell you, Hugh...	0
[ applause ]	0
...you know, it's interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who — who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.	0
Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.	0
And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...and cut a deal.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
So that means on Supreme Court...	0
... can I...	0
... he's going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won't cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.	0
[ applause ]	0
Can I trust you on religious liberty?	0
Well, let — let me — let me just say — let me just say this.	0
Look, I watched Ted — and I respected it, but he gets nowhere — stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.	0
I watched the other senators laughing and smiling.	0
And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work.	0
OK?	0
We have to have somebody that's going to make deals.	0
It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that.	0
Now, Ted's been very critical — I have a sister who's a brilliant...	0
Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?	0
... excuse me.	0
She's a brilliant judge.	0
He's been criticizing — he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill.	0
You know who else signed that bill?	0
Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.	0
So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted.	0
What do you think?	0
Let me — Senator.	0
Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution.	0
I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it.	0
You've got to be willing to cut a deal.	0
And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald — Donald Trump.	0
Why?	0
Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
You know what, Donald...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Rubio.	0
...	0
I don't want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.	0
[ applause ]	0
When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you?	0
Crazy zealot — give me a break.	0
Senator Rubio, you've heard this exchange on religious liberty.	0
You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera.	0
Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?	0
Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here — the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.	0
Justice Scalia — in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document — it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.	0
And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia — plus there may be at least two other vacancies.	0
So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would.	0
But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.	0
Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement.	0
"But the bottom line is that, if you don't have a record there to look at and say, ""I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues."""	0
In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood.	0
He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel.	0
These are concerning things.	0
And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, let — let me just say — let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia.	0
I thought he was terrific.	0
And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat.	0
Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative — more importantly, he was a great president.	0
A great president.	0
As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life.	0
I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood.	0
But millions and millions of women — cervical cancer, breast cancer — are helped by Planned Parenthood.	0
So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly.	0
And I wouldn't fund it.	0
I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent.	0
I don't know what percentage it is.	0
They say it's 3 percent.	0
But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life.	0
But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty.	0
You've been a little bit less emphatic.	0
You've said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake.	0
Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people?	0
Well, you know, , of course.	0
I mean, if — look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church.	0
Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in.	0
No question and no doubt about it.	0
Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don't favor it.	0
I've always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I've moved on.	0
And what I've said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?	0
If you're in the business of selling things, if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with, OK, today I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced.	0
I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce.	0
That's my view.	0
And if you don't agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.	0
But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions.	0
And look, I've appointed over a hundred judges as governor.	0
I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.	0
And you know what they are?	0
They're conservatives.	0
Go check it out.	0
They are conservatives.	0
They don't make the law.	0
They interpret the law.	0
That's all they do.	0
And they stick by the Constitution.	0
So I will do that.	0
But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that.	0
I think my position is clear.	0
Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you.	0
Are their positions clear?	0
[ applause ]	0
Are the positions you've heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?	0
Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia.	0
I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago.	0
A tremendous wit and intellect.	0
As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights.	0
And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.	0
But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights.	0
So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it.	0
That's unfair.	0
And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done.	0
That's why we have divided government.	0
And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.	0
And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person's life has been.	0
What have they done in the past?	0
What kind of judgments have they made?	0
What kind of associations do they have?	0
That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.	0
The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.	0
Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
[ applause ]	0
All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let's talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it.	0
I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.	0
Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good.	0
So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare.	0
Are you saying that you're worried he won't?	0
The individual mandate.	0
He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it.	0
That should not remain there.	0
I think here's what we need to replace it with.	0
We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again.	0
If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.	0
Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.	0
And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage.	0
And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy.	0
It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time.	0
It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law.	0
And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate.	0
Would you respond?	0
I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare.	0
We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.	0
I think we need it.	0
I think it's a modern age.	0
And I think we have to have it.	0
[ applause ]	0
OK, so let's talk about pre-existing conditions.	0
What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance.	0
Are they wrong?	0
I think they're wrong 100 percent.	0
What we need — look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians.	0
The insurance companies get what they want.	0
We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.	0
We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.	0
The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests.	0
They got — I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.	0
And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?	0
[ laughter ]	0
Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.	0
But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition.	0
The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.	0
I'm self-funding my campaign.	0
I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign.	0
I'm going to do what's right.	0
We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.	0
But, Mr. Trump...	0
... And, you're going to see — excuse me.	0
You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay.	0
Right now they're making a fortune.	0
[ applause ]	0
But, just to be specific here, what you're saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...	0
That's going to solve the problem.	0
And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it.	0
They want to say — they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is.	0
I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine.	0
The top guys, they're friends of mine.	0
I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest.	0
They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience.	0
One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling.	0
He's not laughing so much anymore.	0
Hi.	0
[ applause ]	0
Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune.	0
Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing.	0
Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans.	0
But, we should keep preexisting conditions.	0
Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...	0
... Go ahead.	0
You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened.	0
When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.	1
All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.	1
And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.	1
The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that.	0
They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.	0
Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing.	0
What is your plan?	0
I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means.	0
This is not a game where you draw maps...	0
... And, you don't know what it means...	0
... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?	0
[ applause ]	0
What is your plan on healthcare?	0
You don't know.	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
The biggest problem...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... What's your plan...	0
...	0
The biggest problem, I'll have you know...	0
... What's your plan...	0
... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie.	0
I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines.	0
The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....	0
... We already mentioned that	0
[ inaudible ]	0
plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...	0
... You don't know much...	0
...	0
So, you're only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states.	0
What else is part of your healthcare plan...	0
...	0
The lines around the states...	0
... That's your only plan...	0
... and, it was almost done — not now...	0
... Alright,	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
...	0
Excuse me.	0
Excuse me.	0
... His plan.	0
That was the plan...	0
... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition.	0
So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many.	0
They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.	0
Alright...	0
[ applause ]	0
So, that's the only part of the plan?	0
Just the lines?	0
[ inaudible ]	0
The nice part of the plan — you'll have many different plans.	0
You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans.	0
Now he's repeating himself.	0
No, no, no.	0
[ laughter, applause, and cheering ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
[ cheering ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago...	0
...	0
I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...	0
[ applause ]	0
I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody...	0
... Let's stay focused on the subject...	0
...	0
I thought he came out of the swimming pool...	0
...	0
I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone's dumb, he's gonna make America great again...	0
...	0
Senator Rubio...	0
... We're going to win, win win, he's winning in the polls...	0
...	0
Senator Rubio, please.	0
... And the lines around the state.	0
[ applause ]	0
... Every night.	0
Senator Rubio.	0
[ cheering ]	0
I tell the truth, I tell the truth.	0
Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you've just posed to him...	0
... Yeah, he's going to give us his plan now, right?	0
OK...	0
...	0
If you could talk a little bit more about your plan.	0
I know you talked about...	0
... We're going to have many different plans because...	0
... Can you be a little specific...	0
... competition...	0
...	0
He's done it again.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies.	0
They're going to have many, many different plans.	0
Is there anything else you would like to add to that...	0
No, there's nothing to add.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
What is to add?	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you both.	0
Alright.	0
"Governor Kasich, you've said it is, quote, ""Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition."""	0
Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?	0
No, I wouldn't.	0
And — but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions.	0
You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick.	0
Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight.	0
We're actually running significant health reform in my state.	0
I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons.	0
I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.	0
And then we're driving towards total transparency.	0
If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill.	0
The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.	0
And I'll tell you what we will do.	0
We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices.	0
We actually are going to make the market work.	0
Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate.	0
In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate.	0
So what changed?	0
Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well.	0
And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable.	0
And we don't need to do that.	0
Again, I'm telling you that we are going to — we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint — some charge high, some charge low.	0
If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.	0
That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare.	0
Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher.	0
And you know what?	0
At some point, people can't afford it.	0
Our plan will work.	0
It uses the market.	0
It uses transparency.	0
It gets the patient in the middle.	0
And guess what?	0
We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country.	0
And if this will go — this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on.	0
We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.	0
We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana.	0
So that's really what we're doing.	0
This is not a theory.	0
This is what we are actually doing in our state.	0
We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives.	0
If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what?	0
They will get a financial reward.	0
Our primary care physicians need help.	0
They need support.	0
We're losing them.	0
This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.	0
Governor Kasich, thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients.	0
You support covering preexisting conditions.	0
How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?	0
Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right.	0
But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that.	0
We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.	0
I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats.	0
And we give it to everybody from birth until death.	0
They can pass it on when they die.	0
We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with.	0
We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family.	0
So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.	0
And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man.	0
It gives you enormous flexibility.	0
And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.	0
Also, the — your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare.	0
So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered.	0
One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year.	0
You can buy the $1,500 one.	0
That will take care of 75 percent of the people.	0
The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now?	0
Medicaid.	0
What's the Medicaid budget?	0
Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.	0
But do the math.	0
Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all — they will have a lot more flexibility.	0
What could you buy with that?	0
A concierge practice.	0
Thank you.	0
And you could still have thousands of dollars left over.	0
And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much.	0
And, you know, let's...	0
[ applause ]	0
...you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance.	0
But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.	0
It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
Let's talk about the economy.	0
Let's talk about...	0
Wolf, Wolf, Wolf.	0
Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?	0
I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...	0
It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.	0
I know you do.	0
And — all right, go ahead.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Thank you, Wolf.	0
How do you — how do you get that extra time, Cruz?	0
You're very good at...	0
You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements.	0
On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful.	0
I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.	0
[ applause ]	0
On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons.	0
I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care.	0
Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough.	0
And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.	1
What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.	1
Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years.	0
Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, Donald Trump's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.	0
I'll tell you this.	0
As president...	0
Senator...	0
...	0
I will repeal every word of Obamacare.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, thank you.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand.	0
He goes around saying oh, he wants it.	0
I do not want socialized medicine.	0
I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.	0
In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on.	0
That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium.	0
You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more.	0
We have to get rid of Obamacare.	0
It is going to destroy our economy completely.	0
Our economy is not doing well.	0
It is going to destroy our economy greatly.	0
And on that, I agree.	0
Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.	0
That's false.	0
You've never said that?	0
No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...	0
But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.	0
No, I did not.	0
No I did not.	0
Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart.	0
Correct.	0
I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.	0
Have you said you're a liberal on health care?	0
Excuse me.	0
Let me talk.	0
If people...	0
Talk away.	0
Explain your plan, please.	0
If people — my plan is very simple.	0
I will not — we're going to have private — we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president.	0
You may let it and you may be fine with it...	0
So does the government pay for everyone's health care?	0
...	0
I'm not fine with it.	0
We are going to take those people...	0
Yes or no.	0
Just answer the question.	0
Excuse me.	0
We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals.	0
We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.	0
Who pays for it?	0
Well, can I just clarify something?	0
Gentleman, please.	0
Wolf, no.	0
I want to clarify something.	0
Gentlemen please.	0
I want to move on.	0
This is a Republican debate, right?	0
Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...	0
I want to talk about the economy.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Gentleman, gentleman.	0
All of you have agreed — Senator Cruz...	0
You know what?	0
Call it what you want.	0
It's a yes or no.	0
Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.	0
All of you have agreed — all of you have agreed to the rules.	0
I want to move on.	0
We're talking about the economy right now.	0
Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did.	0
The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.	0
How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt?	0
Because the country will become a dynamic economy.	0
We'll be dynamic again.	0
If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.	0
We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.	0
We have the highest taxes in the world.	0
It's shutting off our economy.	0
It's shutting off our country.	0
We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in.	0
Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great.	0
We will have a dynamic economy again.	0
What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?	0
We're going to make many cuts in business.	0
We're getting rid of — we're going to get rid of so many different things.	0
Department of Education — Common Core is out.	0
We're going local.	0
Have to go local.	0
[ applause ]	0
Environmental protection — we waste all of this money.	0
We're going to bring that back to the states.	0
And we're going to have other	0
[ inaudible ]	0
many things.	0
[ applause ]	0
We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.	0
Mr. Trump — Mr. Trump.	0
If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that's about $68 billion.	0
If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that's about $8 billion.	0
That's about $76 billion for those two agencies.	0
The current deficit this year is $544 billion.	0
Where are you going to come up with the money?	0
Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place.	0
Waste, fraud and abuse.	0
[ applause ]	0
You look at what's happening with Social Security, you look — look at what's happening with every agency — waste, fraud and abuse.	0
We will cut so much, your head will spin.	0
Governor Kasich.	0
[ applause ]	0
When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee.	0
You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had.	0
Can Mr. Trump's plan work?	0
Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf.	0
And I've done it.	0
I mean, I — we got the budget balanced.	0
We cut the capital gains tax.	0
You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.	0
And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance.	0
We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington — every single one of them — and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.	0
And why do you do it?	0
Because you want job growth.	0
If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there.	0
You will never be able to do it.	0
Now, I — I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts — the biggest of any governor in the country — and we have a fiscal plan.	0
And it's not all — it's not always cutting.	0
It's innovating — it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price.	0
Now we have a $2 billion surplus.	0
Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.	0
And, look — I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.	0
I've done it — I did it in Washington — four years of balanced budgets.	0
No one could even believe it happened.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity.	0
And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people.	0
I promise you that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
Speaking of taxes...	0
I just want to say — and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.	0
OK, let me — let me — let me just talk about that, because I know that — that Donald believes the energy industry is important.	0
So do I.	0
But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.	0
See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs-friendly.	0
We have diversified our economy.	0
We — we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon — their Cloud computing in the Midwest.	0
You know why it's happening?	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're job-friendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs.	0
Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.	0
[ applause ]	0
"Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I'm quoting him now, ""there is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them."""	0
Romney said either you're not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven't paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven't been giving the money to veterans or disabled people.	0
Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?	0
All right.	0
First of all, let me just explain.	0
I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form — almost 100 pages.	0
You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return.	0
You learn it from statements.	0
I filed — which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion.	0
I built a great company with very little debt.	0
People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down.	0
And I filed it on time.	0
I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.	0
So as far as that's concerned, I filed it.	0
And that's where you find out what kind of a company.	0
You don't learn anything from a tax return.	0
I will say this.	0
Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed.	0
And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully.	0
And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election.	0
And it cost him big league.	0
As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year.	0
Twelve years, or something like that.	0
Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.	0
Nobody gets audited — I have friends that are very wealthy people.	0
They never get audited.	0
I get audited every year.	0
I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.	0
And I think people would understand that.	0
Hugh, go ahead.	0
Mr. Trump.	0
You told me...	0
Are you going to ask anybody else that question?	0
Yes, amen, amen.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Every single question comes to me?	0
Mr. Trump...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.	0
True.	0
Are you going back on your commitment?	0
No, I'm not.	0
First of all, very few people listen to your radio show.	0
That's the good news.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Let me just tell you, let me just — which happens to be true.	0
Check out the ratings.	0
Look, let me just tell you something.	0
Let me just tell you something.	0
I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit.	0
We're under a routine audit.	0
I've had it for years, I get audited.	0
And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return.	0
As soon as the audit is done, I love it.	0
So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns.	0
Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released.	0
And you said, coming out any day momentarily.	0
When are we going to see your returns?	0
Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them.	0
And there's nothing really that interesting in them.	0
So I have no problem releasing them.	0
And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
But this is my time.	0
I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt.	0
This is an important issue.	0
It's a huge issue, OK?	0
In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.	0
That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.	0
You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.	0
And I think if we — the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis.	0
And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question.	0
This debt issue is — the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.	0
It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis.	0
And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.	0
Thank you, Senator Rubio.	0
But I am...	0
[ applause ]	0
...I'm being fair to all of the candidates.	0
Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away.	0
Why haven't voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?	0
So, I've released five years of tax returns already.	0
We will have two more years available tomorrow.	0
And I would note that this question really goes — you know, Donald says he's being audited.	0
Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns.	0
If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.	0
And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis.	0
The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016.	0
And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.	0
Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...	0
Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.	0
... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them.	0
In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary.	0
And this is an example.	0
You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now.	0
They're going to pick apart his taxes.	0
They're going to pick apart his business deals.	0
And let's take, for example, one of Hillary's great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.	0
The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary.	0
"And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, ""but gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation."	0
"I even went to your wedding."""	0
He can't prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can't risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat.	0
And I have, over the years.	0
I'm a businessman.	0
I have, over the years.	0
And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls.	0
Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll.	0
I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be.	0
But I think I'll do very well.	0
[ applause ]	0
But a poll just came out — a Bloomberg poll — where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly.	0
[ applause ]	0
And — and here's the thing — it was sort of funny — 65 percent of the people don't like you — I just got 36 percent of the vote, right?	0
I just got 46 percent on another one.	0
I got 38 percent...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...on another one.	0
That means — and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly — that was going to be his stronghold.	0
"He said a year ago, ""I can't lose South Carolina."""	0
I beat him in a landslide.	0
Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sank about the polls.	0
One other thing — Hillary Clinton — take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll.	0
I beat her, and I beat her badly.	0
And I — and I haven't even started at her.	0
I only had one little interchange...[	0
applause ]...I only had one little interchange, and that was...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist.	0
And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary.	0
They had a rough weekend.	0
[ applause ]	0
Gentlemen.	0
Gentlemen.	0
Gentlemen.	0
Hold on.	0
He — he attacked me, Wolf.	0
I get a response.	0
I was about to say — Senator Cruz, respond.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank — thank — thank you very much.	0
You know, it's interesting — Donald went — went on — on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn't respond to any of the substance.	0
He has yet to say — he can release past year's tax returns.	0
He can do it tomorrow.	0
He doesn't want to do it, because presumably there's something in there...	0
Nothing.	0
... that is bad.	0
If there's nothing, release them tomorrow.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
They're already prepared.	0
The only reason he's not releasing them...	0
You — you don't...	0
... is because he's afraid that he will get hit.	0
I'm not afraid	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University.	0
It's a fraud case.	0
His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.	0
I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud.	0
You don't think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?	0
And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?	0
All right...	0
If — we've got to win this election, and we can't do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can't take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.	0
Mr. Trump.	0
Mr, — hold on.	0
Mr. Trump — Mr. Trump...	0
... first of all, he's talking about the polls.	0
I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
But you're not beating Hillary.	0
You're not beating Hillary.	0
Well, then, if I can't — if — hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you?	0
[ applause ]	0
So — so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly.	0
I know you're embarrassed — I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting — keep swinging, man.	0
Swing for the fences.	0
Let me just tell you — let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case.	0
Not a — it's a civil case.	0
It's a case where people want to try and get — it's a case that is nonsense.	0
It's something I could have settled many times.	0
I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle.	0
The people that took the course all signed — most — many — many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.	0
As — and believe me, I'll win that case.	0
That's an easy case.	0
Civil case.	0
Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited.	0
It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years.	0
Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited — which is a very large company.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
Thank you.	0
I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least.	0
Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... the years you're not being audited?	0
Will you release those years?	0
Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you.	0
[ inaudible ]	0
audited for those years.	0
Which years?	0
Which years are you being audited?	0
Gentlemen...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...we actually have rules — we're trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed.	0
We're going to take a quick break.	0
We have a lot more — many more critically important issues to discuss.	0
Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the University of Houston continues in a moment.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.	0
Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security.	0
And Mr. Trump, I'll begin with you.	0
Shocking.	0
[ laughter ]	0
"You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians — I'm quoting you now: ""Let me be sort of a neutral guy."	0
"I don't want to say whose fault it is, I don't think it helps."""	0
Right.	0
Here's the question.	0
How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?	0
Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right?	0
I think he's treated Israel horribly.	0
[ applause ]	0
I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel.	0
I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.	0
As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally.	0
And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.	0
Now, I may not be successful in doing it.	0
It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind.	0
OK?	0
"But it doesn't help if I start saying, ""I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage."""	0
But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.	0
And I can't do that as well — as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides.	0
With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly.	0
Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians.	0
Let me be clear.	0
If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.	0
[ applause ]	0
And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media.	0
Listen, it is not equivalent.	0
When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel.	0
And I will not pretend that they are.	0
Just today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber.	0
And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel.	0
I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel.	0
And this — if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Well, I can only say — look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years.	0
I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before.	0
I have a great relationship with Israel.	0
And I'm going to keep it that way.	0
And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing.	0
It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.	0
Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.	0
Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee.	0
And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things.	0
And I've been a supporter of Israel — a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage.	0
I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.	0
And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with.	0
Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving.	0
And one — are moving because they're not sure what we will do.	0
It's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours.	0
We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system.	0
It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.	0
When we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.	0
[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
We're going to get to North Korea in a moment.	0
But Senator Rubio, what's wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?	0
Because — and I don't know if Donald realizes this.	0
I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps.	0
But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position.	0
And here's why.	0
Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith.	0
The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels.	0
Instead, here's what the Palestinians do.	0
They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing.	0
Here's what Hamas does.	0
They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis.	0
The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.	0
And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel.	0
"I'm not — I'm not going to sit here and say, ""Oh, I'm not on either side."""	0
I will be on a side.	0
I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump?	0
I'm a negotiator.	0
I've done very well over the years through negotiation.	0
It's very important that we do that.	0
In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator.	0
I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen.	0
He's not going down — excuse me...	0
He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.	0
... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie.	0
OK?	0
The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.	0
OK, no, no, no — a deal is a deal.	0
Let me tell you that.	0
I learned a long time ago.	0
A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists.	0
Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?	0
You are not a negotiator.	0
You are not a negotiator.	0
[ applause ]	0
And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace.	0
You will never bring peace...	0
... Donald, might be able to	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Palestinians and Arabs, but it's not a real estate deal...	0
...	0
Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...	0
...	0
Senator.	0
He will never be able to do it.	0
I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this.	0
Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.	0
Let's move on to talk about North Korea.	0
You raised it, Governor Kasich.	0
The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened.	0
You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.	0
Let's be clear.	0
Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?	0
When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change.	0
That's what it means.	0
Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.	0
But, look, here's what I think we ought to do — like, immediately.	0
And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years.	0
We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.	0
Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.	0
Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea.	0
We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology.	0
And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology.	0
Because we're now starting to take a firm position.	0
We have the attention of the Chinese.	0
The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.	0
But, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means.	0
Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time.	0
You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese.	0
And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them.	0
They are the key to being able to settle this situation.	0
I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important.	0
There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...	0
...	0
I'm very well aware of that.	0
A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between.	0
Would you risk war for a regime change?	0
Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening.	0
What the situation was.	0
But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability?	0
Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later.	0
But, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul.	0
So, you don't just run around making charges.	0
I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.	0
Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear.	0
We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.	0
Mr. Trump.	0
One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position — are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars.	0
We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.	0
You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries.	0
Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit.	0
They're coming out of these countries.	0
They are making a fortune.	0
Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia.	0
Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty.	0
They were making $1 billion dollars a day.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
We defend all of these countries for peanuts.	0
You talk about budgets.	0
We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.	0
[ applause ]	0
Hey, Wolf, Wolf...	0
Dr. Carson.	0
Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this.	0
Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more.	0
We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job.	0
There is no question about it.	0
But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military.	0
Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense.	0
We need to rebuild our defenses,	0
But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
We can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years.	0
We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...	0
...	0
Thank you...	0
... these resources into strengthening the military.	0
So, we can do it all...	0
Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?	0
OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time.	0
I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel.	0
Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes.	0
I had something to say about that.	0
Now...	0
Go ahead.	0
This is your moment.	0
[ applause ]	0
OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong.	0
You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings.	0
And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year.	0
And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year.	0
They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.	0
But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.	0
[ applause ]	0
And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people.	0
I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel.	0
You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel.	0
It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people.	0
We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.	0
And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength.	0
And I think we have to present strength to him.	0
We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea.	0
We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.	0
And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities.	0
We need to be able to defend ourselves.	0
And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
We're going to continue with national security.	0
Go ahead, Hugh.	0
Thank you, Wolf.	0
Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia.	0
Do you support this ceasefire?	0
I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing.	0
So It's a meaningless ceasefire.	0
I love the idea of a ceasefire.	0
I love the idea of — with a total cessation.	0
But it's not working, as you know very well.	0
It's not working.	0
If — we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.	0
So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.	0
Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.	0
Well look.	0
We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical.	0
Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria.	0
And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.	0
One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.	0
So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya.	0
That was a disaster.	0
It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.	0
Another example is John Kerry.	0
John Kerry — Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State.	0
I voted against him.	0
And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check.	0
And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen.	0
His diplomacy has been a disaster.	0
And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.	0
[ applause ]	0
A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.	0
Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest.	0
I think they both liked me very much.	0
But the fact is that ...	0
But you called for Bush to be impeached.	0
Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned.	0
You know it and so do I.	0
But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.	0
Be honest.	0
Be honest.	0
No, this was before.	0
The check came early.	0
But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria.	0
He said I was in favor of Libya?	1
I never discussed that subject.	0
I was in favor of Libya?	0
We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.	0
If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be — at least they killed terrorists, all right?	0
And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting.	0
You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil.	0
As we speak, it's a total mess.	0
We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio.	0
Yes, a couple of points.	0
Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi.	0
The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?	0
And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum.	0
And that's what happened.	0
"That's where the term ""lead from behind"" came."	0
And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.	0
On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department.	0
And she was absolutely horrible.	0
I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.	0
[ laughter amd applause ]	0
And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief.	0
Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief.	0
And he's saying these guys need to do more.	0
South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort.	0
And Japan contributes as well.	0
And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.	0
They can do that very quickly.	0
And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.	0
Mr. Trump.	0
I never said walk away.	0
I wouldn't want to walk away.	0
I want them to pay us much more money.	0
We cannot afford to subsidize...	0
How much?	0
A lot.	0
I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.	0
As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.	0
It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel.	0
I'm no fan of John Kerry.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Hold on, hold on, Governor.	0
Senator Cruz.	0
You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya.	0
Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.	0
You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth.	0
And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.	0
With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades.	0
That's why I voted against him when he came up.	0
And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.	0
And I'll give one more example on Israel.	0
When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?	0
The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London.	0
Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.	0
During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald?	0
If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?	0
If you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel.	0
Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
There's a critical point that needs to be made here.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.	0
Mr. Trump has a right to respond.	0
Well, look, my response is very simple.	0
There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have.	0
Nobody.	0
You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action.	0
[ applause ]	0
I've been watching it all my life.	0
You are all talk and no action.	0
Then name one specific thing you've done.	0
What I've seen up here — I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar.	0
You have a combination...	0
This guy always goes for...	0
You have a combination of factors.	0
He can't do it...	0
This is so typical.	0
... for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth.	0
Other than that, I rest my case.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
One at a time, gentlemen.	0
Governor Kasich, you have the floor.	0
Governor...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
You will have a response.	0
But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.	0
Can somebody attack me, please?	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
There's something — I want to — I want to point out something here today that is — it's so critically important — about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.	0
First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago.	0
They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they're sitting in the catbird seat.	0
We should have been helping them.	0
I'm thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria.	0
But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.	0
Now, let's talk about Libya.	0
Libya didn't go down because there was some people revolution.	0
Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi.	0
They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.	0
And let me just say to you — we have ISIS beginning get — get a foothold in Libya.	0
We're gonna have to deal with it.	0
There are not many major cities in Libya.	0
They're on the coast, which — mostly, it's desert, but it's a problem.	0
Then we have ISIS in — in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq.	0
Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit — one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...	0
All right...	0
... and we're going to have to work our way out of it, including...	0
Let's continue.	0
... the need to arm the Ukrainians.	0
They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...	0
Let us continue.	0
... and assert ourselves as America.	0
Let's continue the questioning on ISIS.	0
Maria.	0
Hold on, Wolf.	0
You said I got a response.	0
You'll have a chance.	0
Maria will pick up...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Hold on.	0
He called me a liar.	0
You're saying I can't respond to being called a liar?	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Go ahead and respond.	0
You know, what we're seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington — the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.	0
And so that's Donald's pattern over and over again.	0
"He said, for example, seven months ago — this is Donald speaking, quote — ""I, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment."""	0
There's a reason Harry Reid thinks he's the best Republican up here.	0
There's a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable.	0
And every time anyone points at Donald's actual record...	0
Thank you.	0
"... what he said on national television, Donald yells ""liar."""	0
Let me tell you something — falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...	0
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
... and it's something Donald does daily.	0
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
I watched — I watched...	0
[ applause ]	0
...the lobbyists.	0
I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race — he has left Iowa and he's out of the race.	0
And I thought it was disgraceful.	0
And got a lot of votes because of that — a lot of votes.	0
Took them away from Ben Carson.	0
I watched that.	0
Probably took them away from me, too.	0
But I watched it.	0
"I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, ""Voter Violation,"" and then it graded you..."	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz.	0
I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics.	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.	0
Senator Cruz...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I know politicians — I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do.	0
And it's not good.	0
I believe it.	0
No, no.	0
I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you've been funding liberal Democratic politicians.	0
And by the way...	0
I funded you.	0
I funded him.	0
Can you believe it?	0
[ applause ]	0
... the reason is — you're welcome to have the check back.	0
I funded this guy.	0
I gave him a check.	0
Yeah, you gave me $5,000.	0
I gave him a check.	0
He never funded me.	0
And — and by the way, let's be clear.	0
[ applause ]	0
Donald claims — Donald claims to care about...	0
You know why?	0
I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Donald.	0
Donald.	0
Donald.	0
I understand rules are very hard for you.	0
They're very confusing.	0
Mr. Trump, you're doing a great job.	0
I have his book.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Thank you — thank you for the book.	0
Go ahead.	0
Donald, you can get back on your meds now.	0
This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank — thank you for the book.	0
I really appreciate it.	0
Donald — Donald, relax.	0
Go ahead.	0
I'm relaxed.	0
You're the basket case.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Go ahead.	0
Donald...	0
Go ahead.	0
Don't get nervous.	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
Go ahead.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I promise you, Donald, there's nothing about you...	0
I've seen you.	0
... that makes anyone nervous.	0
You're losing so badly you — I want to...	0
You know, people are actually watching this at home.	0
...	0
I — you don't know what's happening.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Gentlemen, gentlemen.	0
Wolf, I'm going to ask my time not be deducted when he's yelling at me.	0
You've gotta stop this.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
The latest debate — gentlemen, please.	0
Hold on, I'm going to get my answer.	0
He doesn't get to yell the whole time.	0
I want to move — I want to move on.	0
These are the rules.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time.	0
Am I allowed to...[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
Wolf, do I not get a response?	0
Do I not get a response without being interrupted?	0
You'll get — you'll get plenty of response, so stand by.	0
My name was mentioned.	0
I want to talk — I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government — how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.	0
There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government.	0
The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks.	0
Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers.	0
And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order.	0
Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.	0
"Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, ""Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order."""	0
Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?	0
No, in fact what I have said is the only thing — the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago — the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer.	0
"Apple initially came out saying, ""We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device."""	0
That is not accurate.	0
The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.	0
And I think they should comply with that.	0
If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.	0
So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.	0
Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.	0
But just to be clear — just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?	0
To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?	0
Correct.	0
Absolutely.	0
That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer.	0
It belonged to the killer's employer who have agreed to allow him to try to do this.	0
That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world.	0
But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.	0
Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America.	0
Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?	0
Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question.	0
His answer, he was on both sides of the fence.	0
He's now agreeing with me.	0
And so I'm glad.	0
What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order.	0
Why?	0
Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause.	0
In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone.	0
If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.	0
I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question.	0
But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed.	0
And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America.	0
What do you think?	0
I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, we have the — we have a Constitution.	0
We have a Fourth Amendment.	0
It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure.	0
But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole.	0
And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.	0
So absolutely, I would — I would expect Apple to comply with the court order.	0
If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
[ applause ]	0
I want to weigh in on this please.	0
I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple.	0
You know what the problem is?	0
Where's the president been?	0
You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out.	0
You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.	0
The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces.	0
And then you know what you do when you're the president?	0
You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans.	0
This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.	0
And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor.	0
I do this all the time.	0
And we reach agreements all the time.	0
Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.	0
As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat.	0
You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada.	0
When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't?	0
Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?	0
First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer.	0
You're talking about a massive border.	0
We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts — you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.	0
You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in.	0
And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place — it's beautiful.	0
With the trees and the roads, and the countryside.	0
Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.	0
They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security.	0
I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget.	0
It'll be a very high wall, a great wall.	0
It's going to be built, it's going to be built.	0
It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way — maybe I'll get Canada to pay?	0
Got to be paid for by Mexico.	0
The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece.	0
You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer.	0
It would be very, very hard to do, and we — it is not our biggest problem.	0
I don't care what anyone says.	0
It is not our big problem.	0
Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.	0
[ applause ]	0
I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico.	0
As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars.	0
Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that — the tools to restructure the debt.	0
That is the same debt the other 50 states have.	0
You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection.	0
You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort.	0
That that's where they are now.	0
How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?	0
Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again.	0
And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing.	0
It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.	0
They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there.	0
The tax rate is too high.	0
The government regulations are too extensive.	0
This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next.	0
So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again.	0
If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.	0
So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.	0
They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust.	0
And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.	0
Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...	0
[ bell ringing ]	0
...to someone who has taken a big government stance once again...	0
...	0
Senator, thank you very much.	0
[ applause ]	0
I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.	0
[ applause and cheering ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the University of Houston.	0
It's time now for closing statements.	0
All of you will have 30 seconds.	0
Dr. Carson, we'll start with you.	0
Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate.	0
Think about that.	0
Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands.	0
These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families.	0
And I'm asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America.	0
If not us, who?	0
And if not now, when?	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich.	0
Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage.	0
Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters.	0
It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations.	0
I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.	0
But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.	0
I hope you all think about giving me your vote.	0
I would appreciate it very much.	0
And I tell you, we won't have to spend time figuring what we're going to do.	0
I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again.	0
Thank you all very much.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio.	0
Well, thank you for having us tonight.	0
You know, this campaign has come a long way.	0
It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count.	0
And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.	0
The time for games is over.	0
I know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down.	0
And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com, so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz.	0
Washington deals are bankrupting this country.	0
There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.	0
If I'm elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action.	0
I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.	0
I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today.	0
I will rip to shreds the Iranian — catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.	0
And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.	0
We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump.	0
Thank you.	0
Nobody knows politicians better than I do.	0
They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done.	0
I've watched it for years.	0
Take a look at what's happening to our country.	0
All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done.	0
Politicians will never, ever get it done.	0
And we will make America great again.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo.	0
We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston.	0
My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.	0
Super Tuesday is only five days away.	0
Thank you very much.	0
I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta.	0
He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.	0
And he has had a tremendous career.	0
He's a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well.	0
And so Alex, I've wished him the best.	0
We just spoke.	0
And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous secretary of labor.	0
And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget.	0
And he will be I think a fantastic addition.	0
Paul Singer just left.	0
"As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or as they say, ""never Trump."""	0
And Paul just left and he's given us his total support.	0
And it's all about unification.	0
We're unifying the party and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country.	0
It's very important to me.	0
I've been talking about that for a long time.	0
It's very, very important to me.	0
So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.	0
He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally.	0
And I appreciate that.	0
I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions.	0
And I had this time.	0
We've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.	0
And we've done some really good work.	0
We're very proud of that.	0
And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions, unless you have enough questions.	0
That's always a possibility.	0
I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.	0
We have made incredible progress.	0
I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.	0
A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it -- much of the media doesn't get it.	0
They actually get it, but they don't write it.	0
Let's put it that way.	0
But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.	0
The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.	1
And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to.	1
"It used to mean, ""Oh, that's good."""	0
"Now it means, ""That's good for jobs."""	0
Very different.	0
Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them.	0
I'm making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you.	0
This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.	0
And I hope going forward we can be a little bit -- a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible.	0
Maybe it's not, and that's OK, too.	0
Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.	0
The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.	0
Tremendous disservice.	0
We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control.	0
The level of dishonesty is out of control.	0
I ran for president to present the citizens of our country.	0
I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.	0
I am talking -- and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure; we're talking about its entrenchment.	0
As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say -- they're honest and fantastic.	0
But much of it is not a -- the distortion -- and we'll talk about it, you'll be able to ask me questions about it.	0
But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again, to take my message straight to the people.	0
As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.	0
To be honest, I inherited a mess.	0
It's a mess.	0
At home and abroad, a mess.	0
Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.	0
The middle east is a disaster.	0
North Korea -- we'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all.	0
I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.	0
Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.	0
On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.	0
We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings.	0
Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations.	0
I would say far more productive than you would understand.	0
We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs.	0
It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.	0
I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis.	0
He's over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.	0
It used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.	0
They've spread like cancer.	0
ISIS has spread like cancer -- another mess I inherited.	0
And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism, and we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.	0
And it's not properly solved now, it's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.	0
I've ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.	0
Had great support from the Senate, I've had great from Congress, generally.	0
We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it.	0
But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild.	0
We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment and their equipment is old.	0
I used it; I talked about it at every stop.	0
Depleted, it's depleted -- it won't be depleted for long.	0
And I think one of the reason I'm standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.	0
We have to have a strong law enforcement also.	0
So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength.	0
At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.	0
In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people.	0
These are campaign promises.	0
Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.	0
Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders.	0
They're so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that's what I've been talking about to the press and to everybody else.	0
One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.	0
They lied to the American people in order to get elected.	0
Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.	0
And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians.	0
I'm here following through on what I pledged to do.	0
That's all I'm doing.	0
I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes.	0
I wasn't supposed to get 222.	0
They said there's no way to get 222, 230's impossible.	0
270 which you need, that was laughable.	0
We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes.	1
I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.	1
In other words, the media's trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.	0
And -- but a lot of people are happy about it.	0
In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida five o'clock on Saturday and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.	0
I turn on the T.V., open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos.	0
Chaos.	0
Yet it is the exact opposite.	0
This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my cabinet approved.	0
And they're outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who's there, one of the most respected men of the Senate.	0
He can't get approved.	0
How do you not approve him?	0
He's been a colleague -- highly respected.	0
Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it.	0
We're waiting for approval.	0
So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about and we can't let that happen.	0
So, if the Democrats who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now.	0
The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me.	0
Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time.	0
I just got here.	0
And I got here with no cabinet.	0
Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.	0
I'll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks -- in the weeks coming.	0
We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership.	0
We're going to make trade deals but we're going to have one on one deals, bilateral.	0
We're going to have one on one deals.	0
We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.	0
People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.	0
They go in for a permit, it's many, many years.	0
And then at the end of the process -- they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected.	0
Now, they may be rejected with me but it's going to be a quick rejection.	0
Not going to take years.	0
But mostly it's going to be an acceptance.	0
We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs.	0
We don't want the jobs going to other countries.	0
We've imposed a hiring freeze on non-essential federal workers.	0
We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.	0
We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.	0
Makes sense.	0
Nobody's ever seen regulations like we have.	0
"You go to other countries and you look at indexes they have and you say ""let me see your regulations"" and they're fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have."	0
And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental -- all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.	0
It's very important to me.	0
But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.	0
We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.	0
We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities.	0
Horrible.	0
We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.	0
We're becoming a drug infested nation.	0
Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars.	0
We are not going to let it happen any longer.	0
We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe.	0
And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general -- now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we're starting that process.	0
And the wall is going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me.	0
The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the government.	0
And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either non-existent or a joke.	0
We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.	0
No more release.	0
No matter who you are, release.	0
We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety.	0
We are saving American lives every single day.	0
The court system has not made it easy for us.	0
And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many.	0
We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.	0
No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling.	0
Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe.	0
And is vigorously defending this lawful order.	0
I will not back down from defending our country.	0
I got elected on defense of our country.	0
I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.	0
They already are, I can tell you that.	0
Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places.	0
In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.	1
I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time.	1
I think that circuit is -- that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil.	0
But we are appealing that, and we are going further.	0
We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country.	0
So we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people.	0
That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.	0
We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines.	0
Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.	0
In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel.	0
And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.	0
Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.	0
And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel?	0
And they said, that's a good idea, we put it in.	0
To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C., I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.	0
We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
Obamacare is a disaster, folks.	0
It is's disaster.	0
I know you can say, oh, Obamacare.	0
I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing.	0
So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country.	0
Big league.	0
It's already happening.	0
But big league.	0
I've also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.	0
You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years.	0
That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history.	0
You look at Rex Tillerson.	0
He's out there negotiating right now.	0
General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.	0
We have great, great people.	0
Mick is with us now.	0
We have great people.	0
Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.	0
Now look, fair trade.	0
Not free, fair.	0
If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore.	0
Every country takes advantage of us almost.	0
I may be able to find a couple that don't.	0
But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.	0
Jobs have already started to surge.	0
Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.	0
Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.	0
They were with me a week ago.	0
You know you were here.	0
General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.	0
And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left.	0
And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.	0
Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.	0
And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.	0
Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.	0
There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we're naming.	0
Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades, and decades, and decades, folks.	0
And we're not going to let that happen anymore.	0
Not going to let it happen.	0
And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats.	0
You may not see that.	0
But he'll get there one way or the other.	0
But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.	0
This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.	0
Again, I say it.	0
There has never been a presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time.	0
And we have not even started the big work yet.	0
That starts early next week.	0
Some very big things are going to be announced next week.	0
So we are just getting started.	0
We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.	0
I hope to see you there.	0
And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.	0
Mara, Mara, go ahead.	0
You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.	0
Why did you fire Mike Flynn?	0
Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.	0
He respectfully gave it.	0
He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.	0
And I was not happy with the way that information was given.	0
He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw.	0
What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.	0
That's the real problem.	0
And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it.	0
In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- that they know nothing about it; they weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call.	0
It's all fake news.	0
It's all fake news.	0
The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information.	0
It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.	0
I'll give you an example.	0
I called, as you know, Mexico.	0
It was a very, very confidential, classified call.	0
But I called Mexico.	0
And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that's -- I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call.	0
All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see.	0
It's supposed to be secret.	0
It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.	0
Same thing with Australia.	0
All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place.	0
The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.	0
Everybody saw this.	0
And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified?	0
How do they do it?	0
You know why?	0
Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves.	1
But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.	0
Yes, go ahead.	0
Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?	0
"Because when I looked at the information, I said, ""I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right."""	0
He was coming into office.	0
He looked at the information.	0
"He said, ""Huh, that's fine."""	0
That's what they're supposed to do.	0
They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia.	0
He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries.	0
He's doing the job.	0
You know, he was doing his job.	0
The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember.	0
So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me.	0
And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position.	0
And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.	0
But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts.	0
And then he didn't remember.	0
And that just wasn't acceptable to me.	0
Yes?	0
President Trump, clarification here.	0
During your campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?	0
And if so, what was the nature of those conversations...?	0
The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.	0
And it was very much discredited, as you know.	0
It was -- it's a joke.	0
And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.	0
They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part.	0
They -- I hadn't spoken to them.	0
I think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him.	0
I don't think I've ever met him.	0
And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time.	0
I don't think I ever met him.	0
Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him.	0
I didn't talk to him ever.	0
And he thought it was a joke.	0
The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call.	0
Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.	0
And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries.	0
That's what he does.	0
I mean, people know that.	0
That's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man.	0
He's a respected man.	0
But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that.	0
Everybody knew that.	0
So, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.	0
And he said that very forcefully.	0
I saw his statement.	0
He said it very forcefully.	0
Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.	0
So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.	0
And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.	0
I have no loans in Russia.	0
I don't have any deals in Russia.	0
President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.	0
He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.	0
But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country.	0
So that's the extent.	0
Russia is fake news.	0
Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media.	0
The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.	0
As you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved.	0
But our new people are going in.	0
And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday.	0
And it talked about -- these are front page.	0
So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.	0
So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true.	0
And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media.	0
I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.	0
But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media.	0
How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?	0
That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story.	0
And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump.	0
They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.	0
And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented.	0
I said give us the retraction.	0
They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.	0
OK, go ahead.	0
I am.	0
Just wanted to get untangled.	0
Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.	0
In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008?	0
Yeah.	0
President Obama, 332.	0
George H.W.	0
Bush, 426 when he won as President.	0
So why should Americans trust --	0
...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given we had a very, very big margin.	0
I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake?	0
Well, I don't know, I was given that information.	0
I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around.	0
But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Go ahead Sir, yes?	0
Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?	0
Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?	0
What -- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing?	0
Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.	0
We are.	0
Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?	0
Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.	0
The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of.	0
But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.	0
As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong.	0
My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself.	0
He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.	0
It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong.	0
"I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said ""well I don't see"" -- to me, he was doing the job."	0
The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates.	0
"And I was a little surprised because I said ""doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there."""	0
But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable.	0
As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.	0
That was very normal.	0
You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.	0
After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.	0
So -- and I do.	0
And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.	0
Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...	0
...Go ahead.	0
Finish off then I'll get you.	0
I'm sorry.	0
What will you do on the leaks?	0
You've said twice today...	0
...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious.	0
I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.	0
Those are criminal leaks.	0
They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in.	0
You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.	0
We just had Jeff Sessions approved.	0
Injustice, as an example.	0
So, we are looking into that very seriously.	0
It's a criminal act.	0
You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.	0
"But I said ""you know, it doesn't make sense."	0
"That won't happen"" but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way."	0
Same thing with Australia.	0
"I said ""that's terrible that it was leaked"" but it wasn't that important."	0
"But then I said to myself ""what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?"""	0
What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East?	0
Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level?	0
Are you going to be reporting about that too?	0
So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.	0
So I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.	0
"All this information gets put into the ""Washington Post"" and gets put into the ""New York Times"" and I'm saying ""what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East?"	0
What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?	0
We got to stop it.	0
That's why it's a criminal penalty.	0
I just want to get you to clarify this very important point.	0
Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?	0
And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?	0
Well the leaks are real.	0
You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real.	0
You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real.	0
The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.	0
So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it.	0
Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.	0
It's very important to me and especially in this position.	0
It's very important.	0
I don't mind bad stories.	0
I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that.	0
But I'm not OK when it is fake.	0
I mean, I watch CNN, it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.	0
I don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no.	0
It's OK, Jim.	0
It's OK, Jim, you'll have your chance.	0
But I watch others too.	0
You're not the only one so don't feel badly.	0
But I think it should be straight.	0
I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting.	0
I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.	0
People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.	1
I think that's right.	0
I don't know, Peter, is that one right?	0
Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress.	0
But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.	0
I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet.	0
I mean, the numbers are crazy.	0
When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.	0
I'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for.	0
And that's all they're doing, is delaying.	0
And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going.	0
The only thing they can do is delay.	0
And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.	0
And sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine.	0
But I think it would -- I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly.	0
This is pure delay tactics.	0
And they say it, and everybody understands it.	0
Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.	0
The first part of my question on contacts.	0
Do you definitively say that nobody --	0
Well, I had nothing to do with it.	0
I have nothing to do with Russia.	0
I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything.	0
Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information.	1
They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.	0
Which, by the way, nobody mentions.	0
Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.	0
Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions?	0
It would be the electric chair.	0
OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John.	0
Yes?	0
We'll do you next Jim, I do you next.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
I just want to clarify one other thing.	0
Yes, yes, sure	0
Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador —	0
No, I didn't.	0
-- prior to your --	0
No, I didn't.	0
-- prior to your --	0
No, I didn't.	0
And then fired him —	0
Excuse me. Did you fire him because	0
[Inaudible]	0
No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence.	0
Very simple.	0
Mike was doing his job.	0
He was calling countries and his counterparts.	0
So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it.	0
I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.	0
I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job.	0
And it came out that way -- and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him.	0
And since then, I've watched many other people say that.	0
No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it.	0
OK?	0
Jim?	0
Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you.	0
I don't hate you.	0
OK.	0
So, pass that along —	0
Ask -- ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job.	0
OK?	0
If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir —	0
Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people.	0
You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.	0
It's pretty good right now, actually.	0
OK, go ahead, John.	0
If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.	0
You welcomed that.	0
At one time —	0
I was OK with it.	0
-- you said -- you said that you loved WikiLeaks.	0
At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails.	0
I'm wondering, sir, if you --	0
Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.	0
Then, your numbers were off too.	0
No -- no, but I did say 30.	0
But it was actually higher than that.	0
If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during the campaign —	0
OK, fair question.	0
Ready?	0
Well, if I may ask you that —	0
No -- no, but let me do one at a time.	0
If I may as a follow up?	0
Do you mind?	0
Yes, sir.	0
All right.	0
So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information.	0
In the other case, you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.	0
I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.	0
He said terrible things about her.	0
But it wasn't classified information.	0
But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.	0
I don't want to be hacked.	0
And we did that.	0
And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.	1
The DNC did not do that.	0
And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.	0
But they were hacked and terrible things came in.	0
And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.	0
Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.	0
I would have been headline in every newspaper.	0
I mean, think of it.	0
They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.	0
"Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job."""	0
And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about.	0
You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.	0
I guess I don't understand.	0
It seems that there's a disconnect there.	0
If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?	0
The reporting is fake. Look, look...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
You know what it is?	0
Here's the thing.	0
The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.	0
They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved.	0
I'm involved.	0
I've been involved with this stuff all my life.	0
But I'm involved.	0
So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.	0
I just see many, many untruthful things.	0
And I'll tell you what else I see.	0
I see tone.	0
"You know the word ""tone."""	0
The tone is such hatred.	0
I'm really not a bad person, by the way.	0
No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.	0
I watched this morning a couple of the networks.	0
And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people.	0
They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.	0
But they have the most honest morning show.	0
That's all I can say.	0
It's the most honest.	0
But the tone, Jim.	0
If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening.	0
You just take a look at that show.	0
That is a constant hit.	0
The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.	0
The good news is he doesn't have good ratings.	0
But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.	0
And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.	0
Now, I will say this.	0
I watch it.	0
I see it.	0
I'm amazed by it.	0
And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do.	0
The public gets it, you know.	0
Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.	0
They want to throw their placards at CNN.	0
You know.	0
I -- I think you would do much better by being different.	0
But you just take a look.	0
Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.	0
If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.	0
Now, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK?	0
But they'll take this news conference -- don't forget, that's the way I won.	0
Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.	0
OK?	0
[Crosstalk]	0
No, that's how I won.	0
I won with news conferences and probably speeches.	0
I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people.	0
That's for sure.	0
But I'm having a good time.	0
"Tomorrow, they will say, ""Donald Trump rants and raves at the press."""	0
I'm not ranting and raving.	0
I'm just telling you.	0
You know, you're dishonest people.	0
But -- but I'm not ranting and raving.	0
I love this.	0
I'm having a good time doing it.	0
"But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, ""Donald Trump rants and raves."""	0
I'm not ranting and raving.	0
Go ahead.	0
If I may, just one more followup...	0
Should I let him have a little bit more?	0
What do you think, Peter?	0
Peter, should I have -- let him have a little bit more?	0
Sit down.	0
Sit down. We'll...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir...	0
I'm changing it from fake news, though.	0
Doesn't that under...	0
Very fake news.	0
... I know, but aren't you...	0
[Laughter]	0
Go ahead.	0
Real news, Mr. President, real news.	0
And you're not related to our new...	0
I am not related, sir.	0
No.	0
I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.	0
I looked -- you know, I looked at that name.	0
I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?	0
Alex Acosta.	0
I'm sure you checked that out, sir.	0
"OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, ""No, sir."""	0
"I said, ""Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree."""	0
"But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like ""fake news""?"	0
Why not just say it's a story I don't like.	0
I do that.	0
"When you call it ""fake news,"" you're undermining confidence in our news media."	0
Isn’t that important?	0
No, no.	0
I do that.	0
Here's the thing.	0
OK.	0
I understand what you're -- and you're right about that, except this.	0
See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.	0
"And sometimes I'll say, ""Wow, that's going to be a great story."""	0
And I'll get killed.	0
I know what's good and bad.	0
I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you.	0
But I know what's good.	0
I know what's bad.	0
And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK.	0
They'll even make it negative.	0
So I understand it.	0
So, because I'm there.	0
I know what was said.	0
I know who's saying it.	0
I'm there.	0
So it's very important to me.	0
Look, I want to see an honest press.	0
When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press.	0
The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore.	0
Now, maybe I had something to do with that.	0
I don't know.	0
But they don't believe you.	0
If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?	0
Of course, he had some questions also.	0
But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster.	0
I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me.	0
But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN, I mean it's story after story after story is bad.	0
I won.	0
I won.	0
And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos.	0
We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press.	0
You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.	0
"And I'm saying ""here's my chief of staff,"" a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC."	0
I mean, he won the election, right?	0
We won the presidency.	0
We got some senators, we got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job.	0
"And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said ""you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires."""	0
I mean, they're fake.	0
They're not true.	0
And isn't that a shame because he'd rather be working on healthcare, he'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim.	0
I mean that.	0
I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.	0
I sort of understand there's a certain bias maybe by Jeff or somebody, you know -- you know, whatever reason.	0
But -- and I understand that.	0
But you've got to be at least a little bit fair and that's why the public sees it.	0
They see it.	0
They see it's not fair.	0
You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.	0
And the public is smart, they understand it.	0
Go ahead. We have no doubt that your latest story is	0
[Inaudible]	0
.	0
But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news?	0
And secondly --	0
...I think they don't believe it.	0
I don't think the public -- that's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.	0
I don't think they believe it.	0
Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse.	0
That's a ruse.	0
And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.	0
"Now tomorrow, you'll say ""Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible."""	0
It's not terrible.	0
It's good.	0
We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.	0
We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.	1
You know what uranium is, right?	0
This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things.	0
Nobody talks about that.	0
I didn't do anything for Russia.	0
I've done nothing for Russia.	0
Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.	0
Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember?	0
With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks.	0
Here, take a look.	0
He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?	0
Hillary Clinton -- that was the reset, remember it said reset?	0
Now if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy.	0
If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing.	0
We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who's going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him.	0
"I said ""I know politically it's probably not good for me."""	0
The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles off shore right out of the water.	0
"Everyone in this country's going to say ""oh, it's so great."""	0
That's not great.	0
That's not great.	0
I would love to be able to get along with Russia.	0
Now, you've had a lot of presidents that haven't taken that tack.	0
Look where we are now.	0
Look where we are now.	0
So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff.	0
But -- but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.	0
Maybe it is.	0
But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.	0
"And probably Putin said ""you know."""	0
"He's sitting behind his desk and he's saying ""you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely."	0
"It's going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story."""	0
OK?	0
And that's a shame because if we could get along with Russia -- and by the way, China and Japan and everyone.	0
If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.	0
Is tax reform on the line?	0
Mr. President?	0
Mr. President?	0
Mr. President, since you...	0
Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.	0
We're doing Obamacare.	0
We're in final stages.	0
We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.	0
And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.	0
It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.	0
So we'll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March, mid-March.	0
And after that, we're going to come up, and we're doing very well on tax reform.	0
Yes?	0
Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.	0
Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.	0
OK.	0
You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.	0
Not good.	0
There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.	0
Not good.	0
I listened to you during the campaign ...	0
Excuse me, excuse me.	0
When did it happen?	0
"It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, ""Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us."""	0
Because the -- you have to understand.	0
"If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, ""Oh, isn't that wonderful."""	0
But I know you well enough.	0
"Then you would say, ""Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that."" Look, all of the..."	0
[Crosstalk]	0
I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Wait a minute.	0
Wait, wait.	0
Excuse me just one second.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal.	0
So Hillary Clinton tries a re-set.	0
It failed.	0
They all tried.	0
But I'm different than those people.	0
Go ahead.	0
How are you interpreting those moves?	0
And what do you intend to do about them?	0
Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?	0
I have.	0
I have.	0
And I'm so beautifully represented.	0
I'm so honored that the Senate approved him.	0
He's going to be fantastic.	0
Yes, I think that I've already...	0
Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?	0
No, I don't think so.	0
I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.	0
I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.	0
Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.	0
Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal.	0
I don't know.	0
We might.	0
We might not.	0
But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better.	0
But you know what?	0
I want to do the right thing for the American people.	0
And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.	0
If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.	0
There's no up-side.	0
We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.	0
I have been briefed.	0
And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.	0
They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.	0
If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.	0
So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...	0
Who did I say is not good?	0
No, I read off the three things that have recently happened.	0
Each one of them you said they're not good.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
No, it's not good, but they happened.	0
But do they damage the relationship?	0
Do they undermine...	0
They all happened recently. No...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
... this country's ability to work with Russia?	0
They all happened recently.	0
And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.	0
Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.	0
And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?	0
Does anybody in this room really believe that?	0
OK?	0
But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal.	0
She had the re-set.	0
She gave all that valuable uranium away.	0
She did other things.	0
You know, they say I'm close to Russia.	0
Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.	0
She's close to Russia.	0
Can we...	0
I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia?	0
You know what I gave?	0
Nothing.	0
Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?	0
I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do.	0
I don't talk about military response.	0
I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months.	0
We are going to attack Mosul in four months.	0
"Then three months later, ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month."""	0
Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.	0
In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.	0
Do you know why?	0
Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that.	0
And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that.	0
So I don't have to tell you.	0
"I don't want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here's what we're going to do."""	0
I don't have to do that.	0
I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Wait a minute.	0
I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.	0
And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran.	0
You know why?	0
Because they shouldn't know.	0
And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.	0
So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you.	0
But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.	0
OK.	0
Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President.	0
The trouble...	0
Where are you from?	0
BBC.	0
Here's another beauty.	0
That's a good line.	0
Impartial, free and fair.	0
Yeah.	0
Sure.	0
Mr. President...	0
Just like CNN right?	0
On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth.	0
On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...	0
Yeah, I do.	0
I do.	0
Let me tell you about this government...	0
Were there any mistakes...	0
Wait.	0
Wait.	0
I know who you are.	0
Just wait.	0
Let me tell you about the travel ban.	0
We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban.	0
But we had a bad court.	0
Got a bad decision.	0
We had a court that's been overturned.	0
Again, may be wrong.	0
But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.	0
We had a bad decision.	0
We're going to keep going with that decision.	0
We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time.	0
But we had a bad decision.	0
That's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban.	0
You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.	0
You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.	0
Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.	0
We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.	0
Very bad for the safety and security of our country.	0
The rollout was perfect.	0
Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing.	0
I said this to my people.	0
Give them a one-month period of time.	0
But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones.	0
You do agree there are bad people out there, right?	0
That not everybody that's like you.	0
You have some bad people out there.	0
Kelly said you can't do that.	0
And he was right.	0
As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it.	0
I said how about one week?	0
He said no good.	0
You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.	0
Now nobody ever reports that.	0
But that's why we did it quickly.	0
Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect.	0
The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.	0
Now in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly.	0
Very, very strongly.	0
But we need help.	0
And we need help by getting that executive order passed.	0
Just a brief follow-up.	0
But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...	0
Yes?	0
Go ahead.	0
Thank you.	0
I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.	0
Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?	0
Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing.	0
So that's one person.	0
But he was dealing, as he should have been.	0
During the election?	0
No.	0
Nobody that I know of.	0
Nobody...	0
So you're not aware of any contact during the course..	0
Look, look, look...	0
... of the election?	0
How many times do I have to answer this question?	0
Can you just say yes or no?	0
Russia is a ruse.	0
I know you have to get up and ask a question.	0
It's so important.	0
Russia is a ruse.	0
I have nothing to do with Russia.	1
Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years.	1
Don't speak to people from Russia.	0
Not that I wouldn't.	0
I just have nobody to speak to.	0
I spoke to Putin twice.	0
He called me on the election.	0
I told you this.	0
And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago.	0
We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time.	0
I'm sure you probably get it because it was classified.	0
So I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.	0
But we had a very, very good talk.	0
I have nothing to do with Russia.	0
To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.	0
Now, Manafort has totally denied it.	0
He denied it.	0
Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.	0
I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever.	0
But people knew that.	0
Everybody knew that.	0
But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?	0
You know what?	0
He said no.	0
I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election.	0
You know that, right?	0
He was replaced long before the election.	0
When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.	0
But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place.	0
He was only there for a short period of time.	0
Mr. President...	0
How much longer should we stay here, folks?	0
Mr. President...	0
Five more minutes.	0
Is that OK?	0
Five?	0
Mr. President, on national...	0
Wait.	0
Let's see.	0
Who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter.	0
Mr....	0
Are you a friendly reporter?	0
Watch how friendly he is.	0
Wait.	0
Wait.	0
Watch how friendly he is.	0
Go ahead.	0
Now, Manafort has totally denied it.	0
He denied it.	0
Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.	0
I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever.	0

I could only tell you what he -- now he was replaced long before the election.	0
You know that, right?	0
He was replaced long before the election.	0
When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.	0
But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place.	0
He was only there for a short period of time.	0
Mr. President…	0
How much longer should we stay here, folks?	0
Mr. President...	0
Five more minutes.	0
Is that OK?	0
Five?	0
Mr. President, on national...	0
Wait.	0
Let's see.	0
Who's -- I want to find a friendly reporter.	0
Mr....	0
Are you a friendly reporter?	0
Watch how friendly he is.	0
Wait.	0
Wait.	0
Watch how friendly he is.	0
Go ahead.	0
So, first of all, my name is Jake Turx from Ami Magazine.	0
Despite what some of my colleagues may have been reporting, I haven't seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren—you are their zayde	0
[editor's note: grandfather]	0
.	0
However, what we are concerned about and what we haven't really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.	0
There's been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across country in the last couple of weeks.	0
There are people committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to—	0
You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.	0
And it's not.	0
It's not a simple question, not a fair question.	0
Okay, sit down, I understand the rest of your question.	0
So here's the story, folks.	0
Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life.	0
Number two, racism.	0
The least racist person.	0
In fact, we did relatively well, relative to other people running as a Republican—quiet, quiet, quiet.	0
See, he lied about—he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.	0
So, welcome to the world of the media.	0
But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge.	0
I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me—and you heard the prime minister, you heard Betanyahu	0
[sic]	0
"yesterday—did you hear him?—Bibi--he said, ""I've known Donald Trump for a long time,"" and then he said, ""Forget it."""	0
So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.	0
Just shows you about the press but that's the way the press is.	0
Yeah, go ahead.	0
Go ahead. Thank you, I'm Lisa Desjardins from the...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.	0
Thank you, Mr. President.	0
Lisa Desjardins  from the PBS Newshour.	0
On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week?	0
Even its broad outlines?	0
Yeah.	0
Will it be focused on specific...	0
It's a very fair question.	0
...countries?	0
And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration.	0
Right.	0
What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it?	0
We're gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.	0
To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids.	0
In many cases, not in all cases.	0
And some of the cases, having DACA and they're gang members and they're drug dealers, too.	0
But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly.	0
They were brought here in such a way -- it's a very -- it's a very, very tough subject.	0
We're gonna deal with DACA with heart.	0
I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is -- is right.	0
And I appreciate your understanding on that.	0
But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids.	0
And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough.	0
I'm not talking about new laws, I'm talking the existing law, is very rough, it's very, very rough.	0
As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision.	0
But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more.	0
But we're tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.	0
And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.	0
OK? Mr. President...	0
[Crosstalk]	0
...reopening of the White House Visitors Office?	0
Yes.	0
And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.	0
Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?	0
And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?	0
Now, that's what I call a nice question.	0
That is very -- who are you with?	0
[Inaudible]	0
Good, I'm gonna start watching, all right?	0
Thank you very much.	0
Melania's terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely.	0
And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.	0
And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans.	0
And I think that Melania's gonna be outstanding, that's right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House.	0
She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issue, women's difficulties.	0
Very, very strongly, she's a very, very strong advocate.	0
I think she's a great representative for this country.	0
And a funny thing happens, because she gets -- she gets so unfairly -- Melania, the things they say.	0
I've known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model.	0
She did really well.	0
She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people.	0
She was a very private person.	0
She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find.	0
And the things they say -- I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair.	0
And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.	0
I'll just tell you this.	0
I think she's going to be a fantastic first lady.	0
She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.	0
And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.	0
And they're not doing this for money.	0
They're not doing this for pay, they're doing this because they feel it; both of them.	0
And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.	0
OK, thank you, that's a very nice question.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Go ahead.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's OK.	0
It doesn't have to be a bad question.	0
Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.	0
Go ahead.	0
Well, thank you so much.	0
Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities.	0
That was one of your platforms during your campaign.	0
Now you're --	0
Fix the inner cities.	0
— president.	0
Fixing the inner cities.	0
Yep.	0
What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that's coming out this afternoon?	0
See, it wasn't bad, was it?	0
That was very professional and very good.	0
I'm very professional.	0
We'll be announcing the order in a little while and I'd rather let the order speak for itself.	0
But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.	0
But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.	0
As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.	0
I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.	0
We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get.	0
And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.	0
And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.	0
So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime.	0
We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know, it takes a long time.	0
It's taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly.	0
But we're going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we're going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime.	0
You go to some of these inner city places and it's so sad when you look at the crime.	0
You have people -- and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it -- in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it.	0
They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.	0
They're living in hell.	0
We can't let that happen.	0
So, we're going to be very, very strong.	0
That's a great question and -- and it's a -- it's a very difficult situation because it's been many, many years.	0
It's been festering for many, many years.	0
But we have places in this country that we have to fix.	0
We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there.	0
Hispanic American people.	0
We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell.	0
I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.	0
There are two Chicagos, as you know.	0
There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all -- and safe.	0
There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts.	0
So, we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.	0
I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.	0
OK?	0
Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going -- are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your -- your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as --	0
Am I going to include who?	0
Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional --	0
Well, I would.	0
I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?	0
-- Hispanic Caucus --	0
Do you want to set up the meeting?	0
No -- no -- no.	0
I'm not --	0
Are they friends of yours?	0
I'm just a reporter.	0
Well, then set up the meeting.	0
I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.	0
Let's go set up a meeting.	0
I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.	0
I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus.	0
I think it's great.	0
I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited.	0
And then he said, well, I can't move, it might be bad for me politically.	0
I can't have that meeting.	0
I was all set to have the meeting.	0
You know, we called him and called him.	0
And he was all set.	0
I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy.	0
I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.	0
He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can't make a meeting with him.	0
Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem.	0
But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight.	0
"He was probably told - he was probably told ""don't meet with Trump."	0
"It's bad politics."""	0
And that's part of the problem in this country.	0
OK, one more.	0
Yes, Mr. President, two questions --	0
No, no, one question.	0
Two we can't handle.	0
This room can't handle two.	0
Go ahead, give me the better of your two.	0
[Inaudible]	0
…it's not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about	0
[Inaudible]	0
, around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.	0
What do you --	0
...And some of it - can I be honest with you?	0
And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.	0
Some of it written by our opponents.	0
You do know that.	0
Do you understand that?	0
You don't think anybody would do a thing like that.	0
Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they're put up by the other side and you think it's like playing it straight?	0
No.	0
But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side.	0
They'll do signs and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate.	0
It won't be my people.	0
It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK.	0
[Crosstalk]	0
Go ahead, go ahead.	0
You're the president now.	0
What are you going to do about it?	0
Who is that?	0
Where is that?	0
What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?	0
Oh, I'm working on it.	0
I'm working on it very - no, no, look.	0
Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that.	0
In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided - I didn't come along and divide this country.	0
This country was seriously divided before I got here.	0
We're going to work on it very hard.	0
One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities.	0
I mean, that's part of it.	0
But we're going to work on education, we're going to work on - you know, we're going to stop - we're going to try and stop the crime.	0
We have great law enforcement officials, we're going to try and stop crime.	0
We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime.	0
But it's very important to me - but this isn't Donald Trump that divided a nation.	0
We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama.	0
We lived in a divided nation.	0
And I am going to try - I will do everything within my power to fix that.	0
I want to thank everybody very much.	0
It's a great honor to be with you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much, thanks.	0
Thank you, everybody.	0
So great to be with you.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
Great to be back at CPAC.	0
It's a place I have really...	0
I love this place.	0
[Applause]	0
Love you people.	0
So thank you — thank you very much.	0
First of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp and his very, very incredible wife, and boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters and so great.	0
When I watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance.	0
So I want to thank Matt and Mercedes.	0
[Applause]	0
"And when Matt called and asked I said, ""Absolutely I'll be there with you."" I mean, the real reason I said it, I didn't want him to go against me cause that..."	0
[Laughter]	0
... that one you can't beat.	0
So I said absolutely.	0
And it really is an honor to be here.	0
I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends.	0
These are my friends.	0
[Applause]	0
And we'll see you again next year and the year after that and I'll be doing this...	0
[Applause]	0
...	0
I'll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can and I'll make sure that we're here a lot.	0
You know if you remember my first major speech — sit down everybody.	0
C'mon.	0
[Laughter]	0
"You know the dishonest media they'll say, ""He didn't get a standing ovation."""	0
You know why?	0
[Laughter]	0
No — you know why?	0
Because everybody stood and nobody sat.	0
"So they will say, ""He never got a standing ovation,"" right?"	0
[Inaudible]	0
They are the worst.	0
"[Applause, Chanting ""USA""]"	0
So — sit down.	0
[Laughter]	0
Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.	0
[Laughter]	0
"They leave out the part, ""They never sat down."""	0
They leave that out.	0
So I just want to thank — but you know my first major speak was at CPAC and — probably five or six years ago.	0
First major political speech.	0
And you were there.	0
And it was — I loved it.	0
I loved the people.	0
I loved the commotion.	0
And then they did these polls were I went through the roof and I wasn't even running, right?	0
[Laughter]	0
But it gave me an idea.	0
And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country.	0
"And I said, ""Let's go to it."""	0
So, it was very exciting.	0
I walked the stage on CPAC.	0
I'll never forget it, really.	0
I had very little notes and even less preparation.	0
"So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, ""I think I like this business."""	0

[Laughter]	0
I would've come last year but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial.	0
We wanted border security.	0
We wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that we're going to get...	0
[Applause]	0
... and people consider that controversial but you didn't consider it controversial.	0
[Applause]	0
So, I've been with CPAC for a long time.	0
All of these years we've been together.	0
And now you finally have a president, finally.	0
Took you a long time.	0
[Applause]	0
Took you a long time.	0
[Applause]	0
And it's patriots like you that made it happen, believe me.	0
Believe me.	0
You did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children and because you want to make America great again.	0
[Applause]	0
The media didn't think we would win. The...	0
[Laughter]	0
... pundits — you're right.	0
They had an idea.	0
The pundits didn't think we'd win.	0
The consultants that suck up all that money — oh, they suck it up.	0
They're so good.	0
[Laughter]	0
They're not good at politics, but they're really good at sucking up people's money.	0
Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum.	0
But the consultants didn't think we would win.	0
But they all underestimated the power of the people: You. And the people proved them...	0
[Applause]	0
... totally wrong.	0
Never — and — and this is so true.	0
And this is what's been happening.	0
Never underestimate the people.	0
Never.	0
[Applause]	0
I don't think it'll ever happen again.	0
And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.	0
It's fake, phony, fake.	0
[Applause]	0
A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people.	0
And they are.	0
They are the enemy of the people.	0
[Applause]	0
Because they have no sources, they just make 'em up when there are none.	0
"I saw one story recently where they said, ""Nine people have confirmed."""	0
There're no nine people.	0
I don't believe there was one or two people.	0
Nine people.	0
"And I said, ""Give me a break."""	0
Because I know the people, I know who they talk to.	0
There were no nine people.	0
"But they say ""nine people."""	0
"And somebody reads it and they think, ""Oh, nine people."	0
"They have nine sources."""	0
They make up sources.	0
They're very dishonest people.	0
In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people.	0
The fake news.	0
"They dropped off the word ""fake."""	0
And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy.	0
"They take the word ""fake"" out."	0
"And now I'm saying, ""Oh no, this is no good."""	0
But that's the way they are.	0
So I'm not against the media, I'm not against the press.	0
I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them. And I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don't go...	0
[Laughter]	0
I don't get too many of them.	0
But I am only against the fake news, media or press.	0
Fake, fake.	0
They have to leave that word.	0
I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources.	0
They shouldn't be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody's name.	0
Let their name be put out there.	0
Let their name be put out.	0
[Applause]	0
A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.	0
Let 'em say it to my face.	0
[Applause]	0
Let there be no more sources.	0
And remember this — and in not — in all cases.	0
I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man.	0
It was a very fair story.	0
There are some great reporters around.	0
They're talented, they're honest as the day is long.	0
They're great.	0
But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people.	0
A tremendous disservice.	0
They are very dishonest people.	0
And they shouldn't use sources.	0
They should put the name of the person.	0
You will see stories dry up like you've never seen before.	0
So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story — and I put myself in your position sometimes.	0
Because many of you, you're not part of the story.	0
And if you're not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know — if you are part of the story, you know what they're saying is true or not.	0
So when they make it up — and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election: polls, polls.	0
The polls.	0
They come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised.	0
Actually, a couple polls got it right.	0
I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job.	0
[Applause]	0
And we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, can tell you the network, somebody said a poll came out.	0
And I say, what network is it?	0
And they'll say, a certain — let's not even mention names, right?	0
Shall we?	0
[Applause]	0
Well, you have a lot of them.	0
Look, the Clinton News Network is one.	0
[Applause]	0
Totally.	0
Take a look.	0
Honestly.	0
Take a look, honestly.	0
Take a look at polls over the last two years.	0
Now you'd think they would fire the pollster, right?	0
After years and years of getting battered, but I — who knows, maybe they are just bad at polling or maybe they're not legit, but it's one or the other, look at how inaccurate — look at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls.	0
They're so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative.	0
It creates like this narrative that is just like we're not going to win, people say, I love Trump, but you know, I'm not feeling great today, he can't win, so I won't go and vote.	0
I won't go and vote.	0
It creates a whole false deal.	0
And we have to fight it, folks, we have to fight it.	0
They're very smart, they're very cunning and they're very dishonest.	0
So just to conclude, I mean, it's a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories.	0
They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment, you know, they always bring up the First Amendment.	0
[Laughter]	0
And I love the First Amendment; nobody loves it better than me.	0
Nobody.	0
[Applause]	0
I mean, who use its more than I do?	0
But the First Amendment gives all of us — it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely.	0
It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.	0
[Applause]	0
And many of these groups are part the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it's not your agenda and it's not the country's agenda, it's their own agenda.	0
They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.	0
But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn't tell the truth.	0
Doesn't tell the truth.	0
So just in finishing, I say it doesn't represent the people, it doesn't tell the never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest.	0
Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.	1
[Applause]	1
I'm here fighting for you and I will continue to fight for you.	0
The victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory...	0
[Applause]	0
... was a victory and the win for conservative values.	0
[Applause]	0
And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it's time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker and to stand up for the American flag.	0
[Applause]	0
Yeah, there we should stand up.	0
Come on.	0
There we should stand up.	0
OK. And by the way, we love our flag. By the way, you folks are in here — this place is packed, there are lines that go back six blocks and I tell you that because you won't read about it, OK.	0
[Laughter]	0
But there are lines that go back six blocks, there is such love in this country for everything we stand for, you saw that on Election Day.	0
[Applause]	0
And you're going to see it more and more.	0
[Applause]	0
So we're all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before.	0
There's never been anything like this.	0
There's been some movements, but there's never been anything like this.	0
There's been some movements that petered out like Bernie, petered out.	1
[Laughter]	1
But it was a little rigged against him, you know, super delegate, super delegate.	1
She had so many delegates before the thing even started, I actually said to my people, how does that happen?	1
Not that I'm a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump, you know why?	0
Because he's right on one issue; trade.	0
He was right about trade.	0
Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals.	0
So he was right about that, but we got a lot of Bernie support.	0
So actually, I like Bernie.	0
OK?	0
I like Bernie.	0
[Applause]	0
But I'm here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican party and for the future of America.	0
First we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents.	0
The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first.	0
"[Applause, Chanting ""USA""]"	0
For too long, we've traded away our jobs to other countries.	0
So terrible.	0
We've defended other nations' borders while leaving ours wide open, anybody can come in.	0
We're going to build a wall, don't worry about it.	0
We're building the wall.	0
We're building the wall.	0
In fact, it's going to start soon.	0
Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule.	0
[Applause]	0
Way, way, way ahead of schedule.	0
It's going to start very soon.	0
General Kelly by the way has done a fantastic job.	0
Fantastic job he's done.	0
[Applause]	0
And remember, we are getting the bad ones out.	0
These are bad dudes.	0
We're getting the bad ones out, OK?	0
We're getting the bad — if you watch these people, it's like gee, that's so sad.	0
We're getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn't be whether it's drugs or murder or other things.	0
We're getting bad ones out, those are the ones that go first and I said it from day one.	1
Basically all I've done is keep my promise.	0
[Applause]	0
We've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay.	0
In the Middle East, we've spent as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion.	1
Think of it.	0
[Booing]	0
And by the way, the Middle East is in — I mean, it's not even close, it's in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago.	0
If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you.	0
[Applause]	0
Be a hell of a lot better.	0
We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money.	0
This is the situation that I inherited.	0
I inherited a mess, believe me.	0
We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe.	0
Now, I've been watching and nobody says it, but Obamacare doesn't work, folks.	0
I mean, I could say, I could talk, it doesn't work.	0
And now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you're watching, they're not you.	0
They're largely — many of them are the side that lost, you know they lost the election.	0
It's like, how many elections do we have to have?	0
They lost the election.	0
But I always say, Obamacare doesn't work.	0
And these same people two years ago and a year ago were complaining about Obamacare.	0
And the bottom line, we're changing it.	0
We're going to make it much better, we're going to make it less expensive.	0
We're going to make it much better.	0
Obamacare covers very few people — and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them — it was taken away from them.	0
[Applause]	0
Millions of people were very happy with their health care, they had their doctor, they had their plan.	0
Remember the lie, 28 times.	0
You could keep your doctor, you could keep your plan.	0
Over and over and over again, you heard it.	0
So we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
[Applause]	0
And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we're working with very hard, Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy.	0
[Applause]	0
But I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing.	0
Let it implode completely, it's already imploding.	0
You see the carriers are all leaving.	0
I mean, it's a disaster.	0
But two years, don't do anything.	0
The Democrats will come to us and beg for help, they'll beg and it's their problem.	0
But it's not the right thing to do for the American people, it's not the right thing to do.	0
[Applause]	0
We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years, think of it, $20 trillion, it's doubled.	0
We inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another.	0
We don't win anymore.	0
When was the last time we won?	0
Did we win a war?	0
Did we win anything?	0
Do we win anything?	0
We're going to win.	0
We're going on win big, folks.	0
We're going to start winning again, believe me.	0
We're gonna win.	0
"[Chanting ""USA""]"	0
But we're taking a firm, bold and decisive measure, we have to, to turn things around.	0
The era of empty talk is over, it's over.	0
[Applause]	0
Now is the time for action.	0
So let me tell you about the actions that we're taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people and on my promise to make America great again.	0
We've taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of a great, great border wall.	0
[Applause]	0
By doing this, and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this — our border patrol, I'll tell you what they do, they came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me.	0
They never endorsed a presidential candidate before, they might not even be allowed to.	0
[Laughter]	0
But they were disgusted with what they saw and we'll stop it.	0
We'll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth.	0
Pouring in.	0
Pouring in.	0
[Applause]	0
We get the drugs, they get the money.	0
We get the problems, they get the cash.	0
No good.	0
No good.	0
Going to stop.	0
By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars, and that's so important because the tax — the dollars we're losing are beyond anything that you can imagine.	0
And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities, including our inner cities.	0
[Applause]	0
We are also going to save countless American lives.	0
As we speak today, immigration offers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country.	1
[Applause]	1
And we will not let them back in.	0
They're not coming back in, folks.	0
They do, they're going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of.	0
[Applause]	0
I'm also working with the Department of Justice to being reducing violent crime.	0
I mean, can you believe what's happening in Chicago as an example?	0
Two days ago, seven people were shot and I believe killed.	0
Seven people, seven people, Chicago, a great American city, seven people shot and killed.	0
We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you, and thank them.	0
I've also followed through on my campaigning promise and withdrawn America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
[Applause]	0
So that we can protect our economic freedom.	0
And we're going to make trade deals, but we're going to do one on one, one on one, and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal and then they'll come back and we'll make a better deal.	0
None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster.	0
Just take a look — by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made by any country, having to do with economic development.	0
It's economy un-development, as far as our country is concerned.	0
We're preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
We're going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve.	0
We have authorized the construction, one day, of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines.	0
[Applause]	0
And issued a new rule — this took place while I was getting ready to sign.	0
I said who makes the pipes for the pipeline?	0
Well sir, it comes from all over the world, isn't that wonderful?	0
I said nope, comes from the United States, or we're not building it.	0
[Applause]	0
American steel.	0
[Applause]	0
If they want a pipeline in the United States, they're going to use pipe that's made in the United States.	0
Do we agree?	0
[Applause]	0
But can you imagine — I told this story the other day — can you imagine the gentleman — never met him, don't even know the name of this company.	0
I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct.	0
Big, big powerful company, they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline, same thing with the Dakota, different vice.	0
They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn't connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before.	0
But with the Keystone — so they spent hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants — you know, sucking the blood out of the company, don't worry, I've used them all my life, OK?	0
Don't worry, we're going to get it approved, I'm connected, I'm a lobbyist, don't worry.	0
Bottom line, Obama didn't sign it, right?	0
Could be 42,000 jobs, somewhere around there — a lot of jobs.	0
Didn't sign it.	0
But can you imagine, he gave up.	0
A year ago, it was dead, now he's doing anything, calling his wife, hello darling, I'm a little bored, you know that pipeline that has killed us, that has killed our company.	0
Knock, knock.	0
Mr. so and so, the Keystone Pipeline sir, out of nowhere has just been approved.	0
[Applause]	0
Now, can you imagine the expression?	0
And you know the sad part?	0
Those same blood sucking consultants that hit them for all the money and failed, they're now going to go back to him and say, did we do a great job; we want more money, right?	0
Because that's the way the system works, a little bit off, but that's the way the system works.	0
We're preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale oil, natural gas and beautiful clean coal and we're going to put our miners back to work.	0
[Applause]	0
Miners are going back to work, folks.	0
Sorry to tell you that, but they're going back to work.	0
We have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy, crushing.	0
[Applause]	0
And not only our economy, crushing our jobs because companies can't hire.	0
We're going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business.	0
[Applause]	0
And by the way, I want regulation.	0
I want to protect our environment, I want regulations for safety, I want all of the regulations that we need and I want them to be so strong and so tough, but we don't need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us non-competitive overseas with other companies from other countries, that we don't need.	0
But we're going to have regulation.	0
It's going to be really strong and really good and we're going to protect our environment and we're going to protect the safety of our people and our workers, OK?	0
[Applause]	0
Another major promise is tax reform.	0
We're going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business.	0
[Applause]	0
In anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country, you see that.	0
In fact, I think I did more than any other pre-president, they say president- elect.	0
President-elect is meeting with Ford, he's meeting with Chrysler, he's meeting with General Motors.	0
I just wanted to save a little time.	0
[Laughter]	0
Because Ford and Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers.	0
And they're going back to Michigan and they're going back to Ohio and they're going back to Pennsylvania and they're going back to North Carolina and to Florida.	0
[Applause]	0
It's time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work, you're going to love it, you're going to love it, you're going to love it.	0
[Applause]	0
We're also put nothing a massive budget request for our beloved military.	0
[Applause]	0
And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.	0
And hopefully, we'll never have to use it, but nobody's gonna mess with us, folks, nobody.	0
[Applause]	0
It will be one of the greatest military build-ups in American history.	0
No one will dare question as they have been because we're very depleted, very, very depleted.	1
Sequester.	0
Sequester.	0
Nobody will dare question our military might again.	0
We believe in peace through strength and that's what we will have.	0
[Applause]	0
As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS.	0
[Applause]	0
Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth.	0
[Applause]	0
At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security; foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country.	0
[Applause]	0
By the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks, take a look at what's happening in Europe.	0
I took a lot of heat on Sweden.	0
[Laughter]	0
And then a day later, I said has anybody reported what's going on?	0
And it turned out that they didn't — not too many of them did.	0
Take a look at what happened in Sweden.	0
I love Sweden, great country, great people, I love Sweden.	0
But they understand.	0
The people over there understand I'm right.	0
Take a look at what's happening in Sweden.	0
Take a look at what's happening in Germany.	0
Take a look at what's happened in France.	0
Take a look at Nice and Paris.	0
I have a friend, he's a very, very substantial guy.	0
He loves the city of lights, he loves Paris.	0
For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family.	0
Hadn't seen him in a while.	0
And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question, how's Paris doing?	0
Paris?	0
I don't go there anymore, Paris is no longer Paris.	0
That was four years — four or five years hasn't gone there.	0
He wouldn't miss it for anything.	0
Now he doesn't even think in terms of going there.	0
Take a look at what's happening to our world, folks.	0
And we have to be smart.	0
We have to be smart.	0
We can't let it happen to us.	0
[Applause]	0
So let me state this as clearly as I can, we are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.	0
[Applause]	0
We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand-new action to protect our people and keep America safe, you will see the action.	0
I will never ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people, I won't do it.	0
[Applause]	0
If it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it's OK, doesn't bother me.	0
The security of our people is number one, is number one.	0
[Applause]	0
Our administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still don't have my Cabinet approved, nobody mentions that.	0
[Booing]	0
You know, I still have people out there waiting to be approved and everyone knows they're gonna be approved.	0
It's just a delay, delay, delay, it's really sad, it's really sad.	0
And these are great people, these are some great people.	0
We still don't have our Cabinet.	0
I assume we're setting records for that.	0
That's the only thing good about it is we're setting records.	0
I love setting records.	0
[Applause]	0
But I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats.	0
I said, Democrats, please approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care, too, if you don't mind.	0
[Applause, Laughter]	0
But we're taking meetings everyday with top leaders in business, in science and industry.	0
Yesterday, I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office; Caterpillar, Tractor, Campbell's Soup.	0
We had everybody.	0
We had everybody.	0
I like Campbell's Soup.	0
[Applause, Laughter]	0
We had everybody and we came to a lot of very good conclusions and a lot of those folks that are in that room are gonna be building big, big, massive new plants and lots of jobs.	0
And you know what?	0
They're gonna be building them in this country, not in some other country.	0
[Applause]	0
We're meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement and we're meeting with leaders from all around where the White House doors used to be totally closed.	0
They were closed, folks.	0
You don't realize that, they were closed.	0
They're now wide open and they're open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work.	0
[Applause]	0
And when they come into the White House, we're translating these meetings into action.	0
One by one, we're checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States.	0
One by one, a lot of promises.	0
And we will not stop until the job is done.	0
We will reduce your taxes, we will cut your regulations, we will support our police, we will defend our flag.	0
[Applause]	0
We will rebuild our military.	0
We will take care of our great, great veterans.	0
We're taking care of our veterans.	0
[Applause]	0
We will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good.	0
None of them.	0
You wonder where did the people come from that negotiated these deals.	0
Where did they come from?	0
Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest.	0
They're not as stupid as you think.	0
[Laughter]	0
We will cut wasteful spending.	0
We will promote our values.	0
We will rebuild our inner cities.	0
We will bring back our jobs and our dreams.	0
So true.	0
So true.	0
[Applause]	0
And by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment.	0
[Applause]	0
You know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA and they didn't have that on the list.	0
It's lucky I thought about it.	0
[Laughter]	0
But we will indeed, and they're great people.	0
And by the way, they love our country.	0
They love our country.	0
The NRA has been a great supporter.	0
They love our country.	0
[Applause]	0
The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer.	0
That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party.	0
People came to vote, and these people, the media, they said where are they coming from?	0
What's going on here?	0
These are hard-working, great, great Americans.	0
These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly.	0
Hillary called them deplorable.	0
They're not deplorable.	0
"[Booing, Chanting ""Lock Her Up""]"	0
Who would have thought that a word was gonna play so badly?	0
[Laughter]	0
That's the problem in politics.	0
One wrong word and it's over.	0
She also said irredeemable, but we won't mention that.	0
[Laughter]	0
The GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker.	0
[Applause]	0
You know, we haven't been as a group given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle, during the early days when we had 17 people running in the primaries.	0
Millions and millions of people were joining.	0
Now, I won't say it was because of me, but it was.	0
OK?	0
[Applause, Laughter]	0
And we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it and it's gonna see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me, a lot sooner than you think.	0
[Applause]	0
We will not answer to donors or lobbyists, or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me.	0
[Applause]	0
Global cooperation, dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries is good, it's very important.	0
But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency or a global flag.	0
This is the United States of America that I'm representing.	0
[Applause]	0
I'm not representing the globe, I'm representing your country.	0
"[Applause, Chanting ""USA""]"	0
There's one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America.	0
America, it's the allegiance to America.	0
[Applause]	0
No matter our background or income, or geography, we're all citizens of this blessed land.	0
And no matter our color or the blood — the color of the blood we bleed, it's the same red blood of great, great patriots.	0
Remember, great patriots.	0
[Applause]	0
We all salute with pride, the same American flag, and we all are equal — totally equal in the eyes of almighty God, we're equal.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
And I want to thank, by the way, the Evangelical community, the Christian community.	0
[Applause]	0
Communities of faith, rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers, because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentage of those numbers that voted for Trump. So I want to thank you folks, that was amazing — an amazing outpour...	0
[Applause]	0
... and I will not disappoint you.	0
As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then there is no goal at all beyond our reach.	0
There is no dream too large, no task too great, we are Americans and the future belongs to us.	0
[Applause]	0
The future belongs to all of you.	0
And America is coming about, and it's coming back, and it's roaring and you can hear it.	0
It's going to be bigger and better.	0
It is going to be — it is going to be — remember and it's roaring.	0
It's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before.	0
[Applause]	0
I want to thank you.	0
And Matt and Mercedes, I want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that I have.	0
I see them; they're all over the place.	0
You are really great people.	0
I want to thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
And I want to say to you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.	0
Thank you, folks.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
Live from the Bank United Center on the campus of the University of Miami, this is the CNN Republican Presidential debate.	0
For our viewers in the United States and around the world, welcome to Miami Florida, I'm Jake Tapper.	0
In just five days voters will go to the polls here in this state as well as in Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri.	0
The race for the Republican nomination for president could change dramatically.	0
Florida and Ohio each have a large number of delegates at stake and they award all of them to the candidate who wins.	0
They're a winner-take-all state.	0
So that's the first time that will happen in this primary season and this is the last debate before that critical round of voting.	0
We hope tonight the candidates will give the voters specifics on their visions for America.	0
So now let's welcome the candidates.	0
Ohio Governor John Kasich.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.	0
[ applause ]	0
Real estate developer and businessman Donald Trump.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.	0
[ applause ]	0
Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates for president of the United States.	0

Before we begin this evening, we want to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan, who passed away this week.	0
Her funeral will be held tomorrow and we would like to take a moment of silence to remember Nancy Reagan.	0
[ moment of silence ]	0
Now, please rise for our national anthem performed by the Frost Singers from the University of Miami.	0
[ the national anthem is performed ]	0
[ applause ]	0
Thanks to the Frost Singers from the University of Miami.	0
Candidates, you can now take your positions behind the podiums while I briefly explain the rules.	0
As moderator, I will attempt to guide the discussion, asking questions and followups.	0
Joining me in the questioning this evening will be Washington Times reporter Stephen Dinan, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, and Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt.	0
Candidates, you have one minute and 15 seconds to answer each question, and 45 seconds to respond to followups or for rebuttals if your name is invoked.	0
That's longer than you've had in previous debates.	0
Timing lights will be visible.	0
Those lights will warn you when time is up.	0
And as you requested, a bell will also sound, like this.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
We know that each of you wants to debate these important issues, but please wait until you are called upon and please do not talk over one another.	0
These are the rules to which all of you agreed.	0
Our goal this evening is a serious debate on the issues.	0
It's time now for opening statements.	0
You'll each have 30 seconds.	0
Governor Kasich, we will start with you.	0
Well, thank you.	0
You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful.	0
And many are hopeful.	0
Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy.	0
But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.	0
And I believe it's a new partnership — a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we've ever had.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio?	0
Every election is important.	0
I believe this is the most important election in a generation.	0
Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins.	0
What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.	0
For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation.	0
And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way.	0
If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived.	0
And the 21st century is going to be a new American century.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz?	0
Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West.	0
He was 18.	0
He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.	0
This election, this debate is not about insults.	0
It's not about attacks.	0
It's not about any of the individuals on this stage.	0
This election is about you and your children.	0
It's about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump?	0
One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party.	0
Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting.	0
They're voting out of enthusiasm.	0
They're voting out of love.	0
Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before — 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old — never voted before.	0
We're taking people from the Democrat Party.	0
We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it.	0
It's very exciting.	0
I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.	0
We're having millions of extra people join.	0
We are going to beat the Democrats.	0
We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be.	0
And we're going to beat them soundly.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Let's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election.	0
There have been some real differences expressed in — on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers.	0
"One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls ""disastrous trade deals"" in order to bring jobs back to America."	0
Governor Kasich, I'd like to start with you.	0
You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years.	0
Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs.	0
How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?	0
Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family.	0
And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade.	0
One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.	0
But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade.	0
"And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, ""Oh, America was right,"" and people are out of work."	0
The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process.	0
When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle.	0
And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.	0
But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world.	0
Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up.	0
People will buy less.	0
Other people will be out of work.	0
And we don't want to see that happen.	0
Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.	0
And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar.	0
I understand their plight.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico.	0
Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses?	0
Because nobody knows the system better than me.	0
I know the H1B.	0
I know the H2B.	0
Nobody knows it better than me.	0
I'm a businessman.	0
These are laws.	0
These are regulations.	0
These are rules.	0
We're allowed to do it.	0
And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries — the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.	0
So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws.	0
But I'm the one that knows how to change it.	0
Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.	0
"Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, ""generally very much in favor of free trade."""	0
More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals.	0
If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?	0
No, I support free trade deals that are good for America.	0
We're 5 percent of the world's population.	0
If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth.	0
We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.	0
The problem is we're a low-tariff country.	0
To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high.	0
And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.	0
There are good trade deals and there are bad ones.	0
So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia.	0
It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry.	0
We have a surplus with Colombia.	0
On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others.	0
Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet.	0
If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position.	0
Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?	0
Actually that's incorrect.	0
There are two different agreements.	0
There's TPA and TPP.	0
I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about.	1
And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans.	0
But we're getting killed in international trade right now.	0
And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas.	0
We're driving jobs overseas.	0
And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry.	0
But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry.	0
This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.	0
And you've got to understand.	0
Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country.	0
So the question is, what's the solution?	0
It's easy to talk about the problems.	0
But do you have a solution to fix it?	0
And I think the solution is several things.	0
Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room.	0
Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back.	0
And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers.	0
Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.	0
Stephen.	0
Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers.	0
Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements.	0
You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers.	0
Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?	0
If it's being abused the way Disney did.	0
Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers.	0
Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans.	0
And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.	0
The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad.	0
They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India.	0
That company then hoards up all of these visas.	0
They hire workers.	0
You hire — Disney or some other company hires this company.	0
What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing.	0
They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business.	0
And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.	0
It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans.	0
And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.	0
Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this.	0
[ applause ]	0
You've — in the — in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.	0
Correct.	0
Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.	0
Well first, I think — well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause.	0
But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law.	0
What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.	0
If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law.	0
And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not — what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.	0
They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company.	0
They are making the argument that we didn't replace you.	0
We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead.	0
And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad.	0
It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next.	0
"Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, ""lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers""."	0
He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers.	0
Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?	0
Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled.	0
The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here.	0
I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.	0
Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country.	0
But we clearly have to control our borders.	0
We can't have people just walking in.	0
Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes.	0
The country has to be able to lock its doors as well.	0
So, we — I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.	0
I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border.	0
And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back.	0
No excuses because we can't continue this problem.	0
I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.	0
And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization.	0
Not to citizenship.	0
I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.	0
But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.	0
We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington.	0
And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor	0
Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you.	0
Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.	0
I will.	0
First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well.	0
And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it.	0
We shouldn't have it.	0
Very, very bad for workers.	0
And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.	0
When it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad.	0
It's very bad for business in terms of — and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers.	0
And we should end it.	0
Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.	0
And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it.	0
Because it is a mess.	0
I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.	0
We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work.	0
And we're rushing into things, and we're just — we're leading with the chin.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
We're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership.	0
I'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.	0
Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this.	0
[ applause ]	0
The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers.	0
What should the right level be?	0
Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy.	0
Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers.	0
What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans.	0
Our system isn't working.	0
And then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.	0
And the answer to that, I've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website.	0
We're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol.	0
We're going to end sanctuary cities.	0
And let me tell you how we're going to do that.	0
We're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.	0
[ applause ]	0
We're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally.	0
And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems.	0
It's not that we don't know how to do it.	0
It's that we're lacking the political will.	0
Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.	0
The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.	0
We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country.	0
We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in?	0
Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all.	0
They are just coming in primarily based on family connection.	0
And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system.	0
The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago.	0
The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills.	0
When my parents came, they had a very limited education.	0
My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work.	0
And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school.	0
And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.	0
But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult.	0
We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards.	0
The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have?	0
What business are you going to open?	0
What investment are you going to make?	0
What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States?	0
[ applause ]	0
Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy.	0
The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world.	0
American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading.	0
Mr. Trump, you've called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster.	0
What are your specific objections to Common Core?	0
Education through Washington, D.C.	0
I don't want that.	0
I want local education.	0
I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great.	0
And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is...	0
[ applause ]	0
We were talking.	0
We spoke for over an hour on education.	0
And he has such a great handle on it.	0
He wants competitive schools.	0
He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy.	0
But charter schools work and they work very well.	0
So there are a lot of things.	0
But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his.	0
OK.	0
But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards.	0
"So when you say ""education by Washington, D.C.,"" what do you mean?"	0
You're right, Jake.	0
But it has been taken over by the federal government.	0
It was originally supposed to be that way.	0
And certainly sounds better that way.	0
But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases.	0
Now in some cases they would be.	0
But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria.	0
What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?	0
Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards.	0
First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states.	0
OK, I've been working on this for many, many years.	0
Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards.	0
And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately.	0
They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.	0
Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law.	0
And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.	0
Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids?	0
We need to start connecting them to the real world.	0
We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago.	0
We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.	0
Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion.	0
And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be.	0
So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards.	0
That's what it is in the state of Ohio.	0
[ applause ]	0
So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in.	0
You object to Common Core.	0
Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards.	0
What's wrong with that?	0
Common Core is a disaster.	0
And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions.	0
The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states.	0
It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.	0
Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.	0
And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships.	0
And give every child — African American, Hispanic — every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida.	0
Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country.	0
There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations.	0
Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.	0
Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable.	0
For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans.	0
So, what should the new retirement age be?	0
And how much will those benefits be cut?	0
Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare.	0
One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today.	0
I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother.	0
And we don't have to make any changes for them.	0
But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying.	0
"Any politician that goes around saying, ""We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,"" they're not being honest with you."	0
Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it.	0
So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.	0
For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68.	0
If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there.	0
[ laughter ]	0
If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money.	0
And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better.	0
Medicare Advantage does that now.	0
These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator, the question was specific though.	0
You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?	0
Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part.	0
So the thing is that my — my generation, someone my age would retire at 68.	0
We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70.	0
And so my children would retire at 70.	0
I would retire at 68.	0
It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.	0
But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old.	0
We're years away from retirement.	0
For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all.	0
If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis.	0
It's not a question of if.	0
It is a question of when.	0
In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.	0
That's — all of it will be eaten up by that.	0
That's a debt crisis.	0
And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans.	0
But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years.	0
So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?	0
Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security.	0
They're leaving it the way it is.	0
In fact, they want to increase it.	0
They want to actually give more.	0
And that's what we're up against.	0
And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.	0
I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.	0
And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is.	0
Not increase the age and to leave it as is.	0
You have 22 years, you have a long time to go.	0
It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.	0
I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP...	0
I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters.	0
If that ever happened in China.	0
you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before.	0
They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a — it's a national tragedy.	0
We're at zero, we're not doing anything.	0
We've lost our jobs.	0
We've lost everything.	0
We're losing everything.	0
Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country.	0
I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is.	0
We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in.	0
Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump.	0
You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent.	0
So how would you find that other $147 million?	0
Because they don't cover most of the subjects.	0
We're the policemen of the world.	0
We take care of the entire world.	0
We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger.	0
Our military is depleted.	0
But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea.	0
We take — every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships.	0
We get virtually nothing.	0
We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea.	0
We have so many places.	0
Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them.	0
We are going to be in a different world.	0
We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country.	0
We owe $19 trillion.	0
We're going to bring wealth back to our country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?	0
No.	0
And I — and I think you've outlined why.	0
The numbers don't add up.	0
You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign.	0
In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in Florida.	0
Fraud is not enough.	0
Certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up.	0
You already gave those numbers.	0
The second point is on foreign aid.	0
I hear that all the time as well.	0
I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget.	0
The numbers don't add up.	0
The bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse.	0
Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid.	0
But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.	0
And here's the thing.	0
If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis.	0
Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare.	0
Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it.	0
It is one of the major issues confronting America.	0
It's barely been asked in any of these debates.	0
And we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don't add up.	0
What's your response?	0
Senator Rubio says that your numbers don't add up.	0
What's your response, Mr. Trump?	0
Well, I don't know if he's saying that.	0
Look, I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it.	0
I've been going over budgets and looking at budgets.	0
We don't bid things out.	0
We don't bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry.	0
They don't go out to bid.	0
They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store.	0
That's what they're paying.	0
And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby.	0
They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen.	0
They have great power and they don't bid out.	0
The military is never properly bid.	0
When we go out to military bids, it's not properly bid.	0
And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK?	0
I'm self-funding my campaign.	0
Nobody is going to be taking care of me.	0
I don't want anybody's money.	0
I will tell you something.	0
We're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government.	0
We're going to save a fortune.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts.	0
What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal?	0
Well, number one, we need to see responsibility.	0
Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible.	0
And any politician that doesn't step forward and address it is not being a real leader.	0
We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security.	0
[ applause ]	0
And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever.	0
Every benefit will be protected to the letter.	0
But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation.	0
And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.	0
[ applause ]	0
And one of the things that is critically important.	0
Listen, we've got lots of challenges in the world.	0
But the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away.	0
You have to understand the problems.	0
You have to have real solutions.	0
It's like government spending.	0
It is very easy.	0
Hillary Clinton says she'll cut waste, fraud and abuse.	0
If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem.	0
You know what?	0
That is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem.	0
[ applause ]	0
Here's my philosophy.	0
The less government, the more freedom.	0
The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity.	0
And there are bureaucrats in...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...Washington right now who are killing jobs and I'll tell you, I know who they are.	0
I will find them and I will fire them.	0
Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue?	0
I will let Donald speak for himself.	0
But I will say, there's a reason, in my campaign I've laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion.	0
I've specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs.	0
And Dana, you know why political candidates don't do that?	0
Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you.	0
When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked.	0
Let's talk for example back in Iowa the first primary.	0
When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide.	0
You can't take on ethanol in Iowa.	0
And my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same.	0
They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
If we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you Senator Cruz.	0
Mr. Trump, would you like to respond?	0
Yes.	0
If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit.	0
He did and — at the end.	0
Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well.	0
And you know, I think everybody knows that.	0
It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington?	0
It's easy to have language, I'm fed up with the corruption in Washington.	0
But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington.	0
When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare.	0
[ applause ]	0
When I led the fight against amnesty, it's because I was standing with the people...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...against Washington.	0
And if you want to tell people you're going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?	0
OK. Mr. Trump, I'll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I'm going to move to Governor Kasich.	0
Go ahead.	0
Well, that's fine.	0
First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty.	0
So there's no question about that.	0
And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe.	0
And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me.	0
And there's nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions.	0
I would say this.	0
We're all in this together.	0
We're going to come up with solutions.	0
We're going to find the answers to things.	0
And so far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, let's get back to Social Security.	0
"You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, ""Get over cuts to Social Security benefits"" because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there."	0
Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution?	0
Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington.	0
I took on Washington and I won.	0
I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee.	0
We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt.	0
We also balanced the budget four years in a row.	0
And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then.	0
I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts.	0
Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.	0
I have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age.	0
If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it.	0
It will just simply be less.	0
And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit.	0
That's the way it will work.	0
And we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age.	0
And how do I know that?	0
I've done all this before.	0
This is not a theory.	0
Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget?	0
Yes.	0
It doesn't mean you have to cut them.	0
It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century.	0
So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black.	0
Our credit is strong.	0
We're up 400,000 jobs.	0
And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.	0
And I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Let's take a broader look at the Republican Party now.	0
Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition.	0
How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader?	0
What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?	0
Well, first of all, I don't really think that.	0
I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people.	0
We are more inclusive.	0
And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story.	0
You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening.	0
I am different in one primary respect, and that's trade.	0
I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals.	0
The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs.	0
You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed.	0
So that's that.	0
But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country.	0
The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game.	0
and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.	0
If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs.	0
And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up.	0
It has gone down.	0
And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
Senator Cruz...	0
[ applause ]	0
...Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote.	0
Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party.	0
What do you think is wrong with that vision?	0
Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade.	0
He's right about the problems.	0
But his solutions don't work.	0
So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods.	0
Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight.	0
I don't know where he'll be tonight.	0
But I'll tell you what happens.	0
You know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression.	0
And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent.	0
But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.	0
A much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs.	0
Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, we'll give you a chance to respond.	0
The 45 percent tax is a threat.	0
It was not a tax, it was a threat.	0
It will be a tax if they don't behave.	0
Take China as an example.	0
I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China.	0
They can't.	0
China won't let them.	0
We talk about free trade.	0
It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade.	0
China dumps everything that they have over here.	0
No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews, no anything.	0
We can't get into China.	0
I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in.	0
When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax.	0
The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you.	0
It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less.	0
But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz?	0
Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said.	0
He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat.	0
And mind you, you are paying the tax.	0
It's not China that pays the tax.	0
It's you, the working men and women.	0
So ask yourself at home: How is this helping you?	0
"If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, ""I'm going to jack — I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing."""	0
That hurts you.	0
It's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem.	0
Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.	0
OK.	0
Jake, I have to say — honestly, it's just the opposite.	0
What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants.	0
Instead of in China, we'll build them here.	0
And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off.	0
And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.	0
So we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products.	0
And that's the way it should be done.	0
And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country — our country is in serious, serious trouble.	0
It's a bubble and it's going to explode, believe me.	0
All right.	0
We're going to take a very quick break.	0
When we come back, we'll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this.	0
Stay with us.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.	0
Mr. Trump, let me start with you.	0
"Last night, you told CNN quote, ""Islam hates us?"""	0
Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims.	0
I mean a lot of them.	0
I mean a lot of them.	0
Do you want to clarify the comment at all?	0
Well, you know, I've been watching the debate today.	0
And they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam.	0
But I will tell you this.	0
There's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred.	0
And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump's comment last night, I'm sorry — Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize.	0
Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this.	0
Do you agree?	0
Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say.	0
The problem is, presidents can't just say anything they want.	0
It has consequences, here and around the world.	0
[ applause ]	0
And so let me give you one.	0
Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh.	0
It's a very tough place to be a missionary.	0
It's Muslim.	0
And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them.	0
And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well.	0
And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims.	0
So this is a real impact.	0
There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.	0
I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there.	0
If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims.	0
[ applause ]	0
And they love America.	0
And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military.	0
Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America.	0
No matter what their religious background may be.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
[ applause ]	0
Marco talks about consequences.	0
Well, we've had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House.	0
There have been a lot of problems.	0
Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want.	0
I don't want to be so politically correct.	0
I like to solve problems.	0
We have a serious, serious problem of hate.	0
[ applause ]	0
There is tremendous hate.	0
There is tremendous hate.	0
Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means.	0
Let me go a step further.	0
Women are treated horribly.	0
You know that.	0
You do know that.	0
Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred.	0
The question was asked, what do you think?	0
I said, there is hatred.	0
Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently.	0
And everybody would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.	0
Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
We better solve the problem before it's too late.	0
Senator Rubio?	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, here we go.	0
See, I'm not interested in being politically correct.	0
I'm not interested in being politically correct.	0
I'm interested in being correct.	0
[ applause ]	0
And in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line.	0
We do work.	0
There is — Islam has a major problem on its hands.	0
It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized.	0
And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.	0
There is no doubt about that.	0
It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other — with Muslims, who do not — who are not radicals.	0
We're going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.	0
We're going to have to work with the Saudis.	0
We're going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms.	0
We're going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.	0
And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct.	0
We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us?	0
No, I don't.	0
I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today.	0
There isn't any question.	0
And that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.	0
But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.	0
The fact is that if we're going to defeat ISIS, we're going to have to have these countries.	0
And they are Egypt.	0
And they are Saudi Arabia.	0
And they are Jordan.	0
And they are the Gulf states.	0
And we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey.	0
And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe.	0
The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just — they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.	0
Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we're about and other Muslims who don't share their view.	0
But at the end of the day, we've got to bring the world together, the civilized world.	0
And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody.	0
Thank you, Governor Kasich.	0
Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you've said during the course of this campaign.	0
"You said that the U.S. has to, quote, ""take out"" the families of terrorists."	0
"When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, ""So they can kill us, but we can't kill them?"""	0
It is against federal, military and international law to target civilians.	0
So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?	0
Let me go back to the other just for a second.	0
"In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting ""death to the USA."""	0
Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me.	0
As far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law — this all started with your question on water boarding.	0
We have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding.	0
They have no laws.	0
They have no rules.	0
They have no regulations.	0
They chop off heads.	0
They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead.	0
And we're working on a different set of parameters.	0
Now, we have to obey the laws.	0
Have to obey the laws.	0
But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad.	0
We better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us.	0
They are laughing at us, believe me.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?	0
No, of course not.	0
And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists.	0
The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward.	0
It's difficult to do, but it has to be done.	0
When I'm president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung.	0
They're going to be expanded.	0
And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.	0
And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because — because Barack Obama is gutting our military.	0
He's going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we've ever had.	0
We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them.	0
And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent.	0
And they're not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan.	0
They're going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, you've talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS.	0
Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists?	0
No, of course not.	0
We've never targeted innocent civilians and we're not going to start now.	0
But listen, Jake, I understand.	0
People are scared and for seven years, we've faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia.	0
That is maddening.	0
"But the answer is not simply to yell, ""China bad, Muslims bad."""	0
You've got to understand the nature of the threats we're facing and how you deal with them.	0
And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us.	0
We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them.	0
And I'll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal.	0
I think that's a mistake.	0
The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us.	0
I'll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism.	0
On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.	1
As president, I will not be neutral.	0
And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force.	0
He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran.	0
He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don't think we need a commander in chief...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you Senator Cruz.	0
Mr. Trump.	0
we're going to come to you in a second, but wait.	0
I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject.	0
Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used.	0
"You said you would want to be, quote, ""sort of a neutral guy""."	0
He did mention Taylor Force.	0
He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero.	0
He was a Vanderbilt graduate student.	0
He was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv, many others were killed.	0
And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this.	0
Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks.	0
First of all, there's nobody on this stage that's more pro Israel than I am.	0
OK.	0
There's nobody.	0
[ applause ]	0
I am pro-Israel.	0
[ booing ]	0
I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue.	0
I've made massive contributions to Israel.	0
I have a lot of — I have tremendous love for Israel.	0
I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK?	0
And two grandchildren that are Jewish.	0
[ applause ]	0
But I will tell you, I think if we're going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I've spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is — I'm a negotiator.	0
If I go in, I'll say I'm pro-Israel and I've told that to everybody and anybody that would listen.	0
But I would like to at least have the other side think I'm somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done.	0
Maybe we can get a deal.	0
I think it's probably the toughest negotiation of all time.	0
But maybe we can get a deal done.	0
Senator Trump...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal.	0
I think it's maybe the world deal I've ever seen.	0
I think it's the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated.	0
I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they've ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely.	0
That deal will be broken.	0
Thank you Mr. Trump.	0
Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio.	0
You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country.	0
The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they're our strongest ally in the region.	0
We get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources.	0
And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel.	0
The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization.	0
They pay the families of these terrorists who murder people.	0
And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has.	0
And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad.	0
Let me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...Islamic terrorist.	0
Senator Rubio.	0
He's hunting them down and stomping them.	0
Thank you.	0
Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe.	0
I want to go back to the Israeli government's assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence.	0
Do you agree.	0
Well, that's undeniable.	0
First of all, they've said, they've encouraged people to do so.	0
And you've seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they're doing these sorts of things.	0
But let me go back for a moment.	0
The policy Donald has outlined, I don't know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy.	0
Maybe that's not your intent but here's why it is an anti-Israeli policy.	0
There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment.	0
There just isn't.	0
[ applause ]	0
Because there's no one to negotiate with.	0
The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state.	0
Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel.	0
And that's what will happen again.	0
These groups are not interested in a deal with Israel.	0
What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
So maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now.	0
Mr. Trump, and then I'll come to you Senator Kasich.	0
And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel's enemies.	0
Thank you senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump a response and then we'll go to Governor Kasich.	0
If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look.	0
But I would like to give it a shot.	0
Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel.	0
But I would love to give it a shot.	0
And I have to tell you this, Hugh.	0
I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it's tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel.	0
And some believe it's possible.	0
It may not be, in which case we'll find out.	0
But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do.	0
Governor Kasich, do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence?	0
Well, there's no question.	0
They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock.	0
And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in.	0
Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in?	0
Secondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you're familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel.	0
They're coming at them from above, they're trying to come at them under the ground.	0
And I just have to tell you this, I don't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution.	0
And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do.	0
I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Cruz, I want to stay in the region.	0
Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it's going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix — to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq.	0
From the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon.	0
So here's the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground.	0
Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war?	0
We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS.	0
And that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment.	0
Right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have.	0
We're not using our overwhelming air power.	0
We're not arming the Kurds.	0
Those need to be the first steps.	0
And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out.	0
But, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I'm glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement.	0
We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.	0
They're not able to fight.	0
They're not able to defend themselves.	0
They're not able to kill the enemy.	0
And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong.	0
It is immoral.	0
And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that's what needs to be done, will you follow their advice?	0
Hugh, I've said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief.	0
I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years.	0
We absolutely have to win this with a coalition.	0
Arabs have to be with us.	0
The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer — is as close as it is to us.	0
And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground.	0
And you bring all the force you need.	0
"It has got to be ""shock and awe"" in the military-speak."	0
Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes.	0
Mr. Trump, more troops?	0
We really have no choice.	0
We have to knock out ISIS.	0
We have to knock the hell out of them.	0
We have to get rid of it.	0
And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart.	0
We have no choice.	0
How many...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000.	0
We have to knock them out fast.	0
Look, we're not allowed to fight.	0
We can't fight.	0
We're not knocking out the oil because they don't want to create environmental pollution up in the air.	0
I mean, these are things that nobody even believes.	0
They think we're kidding.	0
They didn't want to knock out the oil because of what it's going to do to the carbon footprint.	0
We don't fight like we used to fight.	0
We used to fight to win.	0
Now we fight for no reason whatsoever.	0
We don't even know what we're doing.	0
[ applause ]	0
So, the answer is we have to knock them out.	0
We have to knock them out fast.	0
And we have to get back home.	0
And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
Let's turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts.	0
Senator Rubio, according to a V.A.	0
study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A.	0
The V.A.	0
believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate.	0
What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?	0
Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that's struggling with the V.A.	0
my brother is a veteran.	0
He's struggling with the V.A.	0
The other day, we heard this horrible story.	0
"It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, ""Calls to the V.A."	0
"Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail."""	0
Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen — one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide.	0
And they happened to call him back the day after he died.	0
People need to be held accountable for this.	0
One of the things I'm proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I'll give him credit — Bernie Sanders was a part of this — we passed a V.A.	0
accountability bill.	0
And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A.	0
secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A.	0
secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job.	0
Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A.	0
outreach isn't working.	0
The problem is no one's being held accountable.	0
Even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach.	0
No one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail.	0
No one's been disciplined.	0
No one's been demoted.	0
When I'm president of the United States, if you work at the V.A.	0
and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget.	0
As part of its attempt to cut costs, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 GI Bill.	0
Should veterans' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?	0
I don't — I haven't seen the provisions of that bill, Jake.	0
My initial instincts are no.	0
And let me just say about the V.A.	0
When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one.	0
Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured.	0
It needs to be downsized and spread out.	0
It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.	0
And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job.	0
And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees.	0
No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.	0
Thank you, Governor Kasich.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let's turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida.	0
Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba.	0
Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States.	0
Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash.	0
Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba.	0
The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well.	0
So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?	0
Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change.	0
But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government.	0
Today, it has not.	0
The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made — after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime.	0
It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone.	0
They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there.	0
They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president.	0
And nothing will change for the Cuban people.	0
There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights.	0
In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening.	0
The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.	0
And we asked nothing in return.	0
Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma.	0
And by no means is Burma a perfect country.	0
But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings.	0
When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening.	0
And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.	0
He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return.	0
And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions.	0
It's harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine.	0
You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine.	0
Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said?	0
Well, I don't really agree with President Obama.	0
I think I'm somewhere in the middle.	0
What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making — as usual with our country, we don't make good deal.	0
We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue.	0
As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.	0
All that stuff has to be agreed to now.	0
We don't want to get sued after the deal is made.	0
So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be — should take place.	0
After 50 years, it's enough time, folks.	0
But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.	0
This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations.	0
So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently.	0
We have to make good deal.	0
Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in.	0
But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?	0
I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba's favor.	0
Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor.	0
It the same way as the Iran deal.	0
We never walked — we never — all we do is keep giving.	0
We give and give and give.	0
But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it.	0
Which would it be?	0
In Havana.	0
I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate.	0
It's the same building.	0
So it could just go back to being called a consulate.	0
We don't have to close it that way.	0
Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal.	0
I'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified.	0
Here's a good deal — Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs.	0
And you know what?	0
Then we can have a relationship with Cuba.	0
That's a good deal.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator Rubio.	0
Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?	0
Yes, I would.	0
And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters.	0
When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy?	0
When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.	0
There's a real difference between us.	0
Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.	0
And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing.	0
The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective.	0
I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you Senator Cruz.	0
Mr. Trump.	0
Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar.	0
I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us.	0
And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear.	0
And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States.	0
As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal.	0
That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country.	0
It is a disaster.	0
So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated.	0
So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it.	0
Senator Cruz, your response?	0
Well, look.	0
I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008.	0
And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry.	0
And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better.	0
No.	0
We don't just need smarter people in government.	0
We need leaders that are protecting American interests.	0
[ applause ]	0
And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion.	0
That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.	0
We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...understands and doesn't give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security.	0
[ applause ]	0
I was against the giving of the money at all cost.	0
I said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back.	0
If the prisoners don't come back early — three years ago.	0
One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way.	0
If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate.	0
They come back early.	0
What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions.	0
What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal.	0
Cause that deal is a disaster.	0
Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators.	0
But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States.	0
Thank you Mr. Trump.	0
Let's refocus this back on Cuba.	0
Governor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms.	0
This is a direct result of President Obama's policy in Cuba that we've been talking about.	0
If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba?	0
No, I wouldn't.	0
Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing?	0
You know, you don't support us, we can't figure out where you are.	0
You won't arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people.	0
You had a red line in Syria.	0
You walked away from it.	0
You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile.	0
And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal.	0
Look, I know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends.	0
And you know what happens when you do that?	0
You make a terrible mistake.	0
You need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here...	0
[ applause ]	0
...and you need to negotiate tough deals.	0
The fact is, they need to understand who we are.	0
The Chinese understand.	0
They don't own the South China Sea.	0
They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems.	0
We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.	0
We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us.	0
We're not rattling a sword.	0
You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.	0
And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for.	0
Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
When I'm president, they're going to know exactly where we are because we're coming back.	0
Thank you governor.	0
Thank you governor.	0
While we're discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening.	0
"Mayor Regalado told me, quote, ""Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods."	0
It's an every day reality in our city.	0
"Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?"""	0
Unquote.	0
Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you.	0
Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?	0
Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing.	0
[ applause ]	0
There's never been a time when the climate has not changed.	0
I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?	0
So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things.	0
Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp.	0
And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation.	0
And I have long supported mitigation efforts.	0
But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there's no such thing.	0
[ applause ]	0
On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass.	0
There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.	0
Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that?	0
Americans are going to pay the price of that.	0
The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.	0
The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.	0
And you know what passing those laws would have — what impact it would have on the environment?	0
Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels.	0
So, I am in favor of a clean environment.	0
My children live in South Florida.	0
My family is being raised here.	0
I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.	0
So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change.	0
When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he's wrong?	0
I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that.	0
If we pass — if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment.	0
Sea level would still rise.	0
All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.	0
One, because America is not a planet.	0
It's a country.	0
And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut.	0
Here's what he will immediately — and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend — but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.	0
He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power.	0
That cost will be passed on to working families.	0
I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami?	0
Well, I — I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don't think it has to be a, you know, either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs.	0
The fact is, you can have both.	0
In our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent.	0
But let me tell you also what we're trying to do.	0
We want all the sources of energy.	0
We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it.	0
We believe in natural gas.	0
We believe in nuclear power.	0
And you know what else I believe in?	0
I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter.	0
Now, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute.	0
But it is important we develop renewables.	0
Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.	0
So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world.	0
Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad.	0
"He said, quote, ""foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed."""	0
Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?	0
Of course it does.	0
And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world.	0
This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks.	0
Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America.	0
Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on.	0
"I'll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, ""it is hard to be friends with America; we can't count on America; America doesn't stand with us."""	0
And that is a disgrace.	0
But the good news is, Jake, we've seen this before.	0
We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter.	0
And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight.	0
It's worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.	0
[ applause ]	0
And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies.	0
That's why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators.	0
"You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you've said: ""When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength."	0
"That shows you the power of strength."""	0
How do you respond...	0
That doesn't mean I was endorsing that.	0
I was not endorsing it.	0
I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength.	0
And then they kept down the riot.	0
It was a horrible thing.	0
It doesn't mean at all I was endorsing it.	0
As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia.	0
I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you.	0
I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin.	0
But the word strong obviously is a compliment...	0
[ applause ]	0
...and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities.	0
I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany.	0
Germany is a disaster right now.	0
So I used to think that.	0
[ applause ]	0
And strong doesn't mean good.	0
Putin is a strong leader, absolutely.	0
I could name many strong leaders.	0
I could name very many very weak leaders.	0
But he is a strong leader.	0
Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way.	0
I say it as a fact.	0
Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre.	0
What do you think?	0
I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids.	0
And when that guy stood in front — that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now I will tell you, I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy.	0
They are a competitor.	0
But I want to go back to three things they should do.	0
We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one.	0
Number two, they need to realize they don't own the South China Sea.	0
And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea.	0
And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we're going to have to beef up the cyber command.	0
And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid.	0
But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems.	0
The president has not given the cyber command that authority.	0
I will.	0
And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency.	0
That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with.	0
And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor Kasich.	0
We're going to take another quick break.	0
When we come back, we'll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami, Florida, right after this.	0
Stay with us.	0
[	0
commercial break ]	0
[ applause ]	0
Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.	0
Mr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block.	0
Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina.	0
This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.	0
Today, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign.	0
"She said, quote, ""this kind of behavior is repugnant."	0
"We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence."""	0
Do you believe that you've done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?	0
I hope not.	0
I truly hope not.	0
I will say this.	0
We have 25, 30,000 people — you've seen it yourself.	0
People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest — in some cases — you know, you're mentioning one case, which I haven't seen, I heard about it, which I don't like.	0
But when they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable.	0
They have anger.	0
They love this country.	0
They don't like seeing bad trade deals, they don't like seeing higher taxes, they don't like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated.	0
And I know — I mean, I see it.	0
There is some anger.	0
There's also great love for the country.	0
It's a beautiful thing in many respects.	0
But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake.	0
"Some of your critics point to quotes you've made at these debates — at these rallies including February 23rd, ""I'd like to punch him in the face,"" referring to a protesters."	0
"February 27th, ""in the good ol' days, they'd have ripped him out of that seat so fast."""	0
"February 1st, ""knock the crap out of him, would, you?"	0
Seriously, OK, just knock the hell.	0
"I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise."""	0
[ applause ]	0
We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things.	0
They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people.	0
And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don't mind.	0
But doing serious damage.	0
And if they've got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something.	0
And it's not me.	0
It's usually the municipal government, the police because I don't have guards all over these stadiums.	0
I mean, we fill up stadiums.	0
It's usually the police — and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job.	0
[ applause ]	0
So we should pay — we should truly give our police.	0
They're incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election?	0
Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people.	0
We need to remember who it is we're working for.	0
You know, we've seen for seven years a president who believes he's above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he's working for the American people.	0
And let me — let me ask, turn the camera our here.	0
How many of y'all feel disrespected by Washington?	0
[ applause ]	0
Washington isn't listening to the people.	0
And that's the frustration that is boiling over.	0
And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people.	0
You know, at Donald's rallies recently, he's taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him.	0
Now, I got to say to me, I think that's exactly backwards.	0
This is a job interview.	0
We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around.	0
[ applause ]	0
And the only hand raising I'm interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States.	0
Thank you senator.	0
Mr. Trump, if you'd like to respond.	0
It shows the total dishonesty of the press.	0
We were having — on a few occasions, again massive crowds.	0
And we're talking and I'm saying who is going to vote on Tuesday?	0
Who is going to vote?	0
The place goes crazy.	0
Then I say, hey, do me a favor.	0
Raise your right hand.	0
Do you swear you're going to vote for Donald Trump?	0
Everyone's laughing, we're all having a good time.	0
That's why I have much bigger crowds than Ted, because we have a good time at mine.	0
[ applause ]	0
But we're all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show and a couple of other place, not too many.	0
Because when you look at it, everyone's smiling, laughing.	0
Their arms are raised like this.	0
They had pictures, still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
It is a disgrace.	0
It was a total disgrace.	0
And I've had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that — what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party's chances in November?	0
Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period.	0
I mean, it's — you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters.	0
Jake, here's what I think is happening.	0
There are people out there who are worried about their jobs.	0
They're worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they're out of work and they're 54 years old and they don't know where they're going to get another job, a man and a woman.	0
Maybe they're worried about a trade deal.	0
They're worried about the fact that their wages haven't gone up.	0
They're worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great.	0
They went to college, they rang up debt and they're still living in their parents' basement.	0
People are uptight.	0
Our seniors are worried they're going to lose their Social Security.	0
There's two ways to treat it.	0
You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed.	0
If we're Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems.	0
We can provide financial security, we can drive the wages up, we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
And you know what?	0
They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I'll give them the power to do it.	0
Thank you governor.	0
Senator Rubio?	0
I know you want to say something.	0
I do.	0
A couple of points.	0
The first is, I'm concerned about violence in general in this society.	0
And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers.	0
And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us.	0
On the issue of anger.	0
Yes, people are angry.	0
Of course they're angry.	0
Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years.	0
But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us.	0
But to motivate us to take action.	0
Being here in Miami is special.	0
My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up.	0
And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history.	0
My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky.	0
One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
You know what he said when he saw that?	0
He said Americans can do anything.	0
Americans can do anything.	0
There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation.	0
Thank you senator.	0
And embrace all of the principles that made us great.	0
Thank you senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention, which would mean a contested convention.	0
Let's go back to Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt.	0
Thank you Jake.	0
Governor Kasich, the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention.	0
If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie, Donald Trump has the most delegates.	0
Why shouldn't the person with the most delegates, even if it's not a majority of delegates, be the nominee?	0
Well, first of all, let's not — you know, math doesn't tell the whole story in politics.	0
The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what's true today is not necessarily true tomorrow.	0
So let's not get ahead of ourselves.	0
Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK.	0
If you got an 86, you got a B.	0
Because everybody else had an 84 didn't mean you got an A.	0
So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee.	0
And frankly, I don't know if we're going to get a convention like that.	0
But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him.	0
He tried valiantly.	0
He lost.	0
Gerald Ford won.	0
The party was united.	0
Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon.	0
He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first.	0
And we were healed as a party.	0
So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked.	0
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.	0
We don't know what's going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected.	0
And that's what's going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Mr. Trump, if you arrive in Cleveland with a plurality and the most, but not a majority, is it legitimate for someone else to emerge from that convention the nominee?	0
And if so, would you support that person?	0
I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever — first of all, I think I'm going to have the delegates.	0
OK?	0
I think.	0
Let's see what happens.	0
[ applause ]	0
But if somebody doesn't have the delegates, and I guess there's two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment.	0
But if — no, that's just — by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism.	0
That's just a mathematical fact.	0
OK?	0
If two of us get up there, I would say this, if — if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win.	0
That's what I think.	0
Senator Cruz, if you — if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention, what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election?	0
Well, look, there are some folks in Washington...	0
Make me president.	0
[ applause ]	0
Donald, you are welcome to be president of the Smithsonian.	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention.	0
They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee.	0
I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters.	0
[ applause ]	0
It's one of the reasons why in the course of this election — listen, everyone up here has worked very hard.	0
But Donald is right, there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself.	0
At this point, I have roughly 360 delegates.	0
He has about 100 more than I have.	0
We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically, from Maine to Alaska, from Kansas to Texas, all over this country we have beaten him.	0
And so for the people at home, if you're one of the 65, 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins.	0
That's why the media wants him to be the nominee so much.	0
If you recognize that, then I want to invite you if you've supported other candidates, come and join us.	0
We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting.	0
It's why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday.	0
It's why Mike Lee endorsed me today.	0
I ask everyone to come together.	0
Let's stand together and let's beat Hillary Clinton in November.	0
All right.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, then to Senator Rubio.	0
"You know, I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks, and he's always saying, ""I'm the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him."""	0
But I beat him in 13 contests.	0
He never mentions that.	0
[ applause ]	0
And let me just tell you another little fact, little minor fact.	0
I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season, more votes than Ted.	0
The other thing is, I beat Hillary, and I will give you the list, I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken.	0
And each week, I get better and better.	0
And believe me, I haven't even started on her yet.	0
Senator Rubio?	0
Let me tell you what this election is about for me.	0
And I get all the delegate math and all that debate.	0
Let me tell you what's about for me.	0
On Tuesday night, I didn't do as well, obviously, as I wanted to.	0
And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home.	0
And my wife told me a story that night, which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting.	0
There's a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery.	0
And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting.	0
"But every afternoon, he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says ""Marco Rubio."""	0
Because for him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves	0
[ applause ]	0
That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him.	0
I am going to work tirelessly every single day...	0
[ applause ]	0
...because this election is too important.	0
What's at stake is the future of this country.	0
And I believe — I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I've always believed that God has blessed America, that God's hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Let's send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.	0
Stephen?	0
Mr. Trump, one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign, and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors.	0
Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election?	0
I have not made that decision yet.	0
I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision.	0
My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth.	0
I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I'm turning down money.	0
I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you.	0
I don't know if I get any credit for it but I'm self-funding my campaign.	0
And other than — and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it's not a large amount.	0
No, I'm self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I've been in this business a long time and I was on the other side — until eight months ago I was on the or side.	0
I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans.	0
I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing.	0
I will say this — people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians.	0
I don't want anybody to control me but the people right out there.	0
And I'm going to do the right thing.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, I want to come to you.	0
The vast majority of Republicans, and voters overall, agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns.	0
Do you deny that those big donors do have influence?	0
Well look, absolutely.	0
And one of the things we're so frustrated about is the corruption, what I've called the Washington cartel.	0
It's career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests.	0
And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he's been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party.	0
And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change.	0
But the interesting point is tonight he hasn't pointed to a single special interest he's willing to take on.	0
He didn't take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street.	0
He won't take on ethanol.	0
And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
I want to go to Mr. Trump...	0
$62 at tedcruz.org.	0
... for a response.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
That's who you've got to be accountable to, the people.	0
Ted was given to PACs.	0
I mean, PACs — you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks.	0
Very corrupt.	0
It's going to lead to lots of disasters.	0
But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one.	0
It's very important to do that.	0
There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived.	0
And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken.	0
And I'm the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I've always made large contributions.	0
And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I'm the only one up here that's going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
Senator Rubio, I want to come to you with a question.	0
At the last debate, you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible.	0
With so much gridlock in Washington, how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren't willing to show flexibility?	0
Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn't be flexible about your principles.	0
About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that.	0
Listen, on the issue of higher education, I'm the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt.	0
So I know this is a major issue.	0
And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan.	0
The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a — on a bipartisan basis.	0
The sanctions that I helped — that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis.	0
The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis.	0
But I also want to be frank.	0
There are issues we're going to have to have an election over.	0
When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that's not going to be bipartisan.	0
When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that's not going to be bipartisan.	0
When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that's probably not going to be bipartisan.	0
There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government.	0
And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence.	0
What are some of the other issues on which you're willing to show flexibility?	0
It depends on what comes up.	0
You never know.	0
It depends on what comes up.	0
Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan.	0
We had Tip O'Neill, speaker.	0
And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully.	0
Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made.	0
And he made it with Tip O'Neill.	0
We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint.	0
And I'll tell you this, it can be done.	0
We don't want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind.	0
We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there's total, absolute gridlock.	0
Thank you.	0
I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility, sir.	0
Well, look, my record speaks for itself.	0
What I talk about tonight is not a theory.	0
These are things that I've done.	0
I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together.	0
I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon.	0
I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington.	0
And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare,	0
I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor.	0
My problem isn't that people don't know this.	0
They say, well, what does that mean?	0
Does that mean you're too easy?	0
Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government.	0
In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years.	0
Conservative principles will work.	0
But show respect to the other side.	0
One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone.	0
We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security.	0
I know how to do it because I've done it and I'll do it again.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
We have time for one last break.	0
We'll be right back after this.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
And we're back with the Republican presidential debate, just five days before the next primary elections.	0
It is time now for closing statements.	0
Candidates, you will each have one minute.	0
And we'll start with Governor Kasich.	0
Well, I'd like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States.	0
I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision.	0
And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States.	0
Sometimes being positive isn't all that interesting, but it's very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign.	0
I can fix the problems in Washington, I've done it before.	0
And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty.	0
We can do this together.	0
Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families.	0
That's where the spirit and strength of America is.	0
But ask the people — my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote.	0
God bless.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio.	0
It's great to be here, back at home in Miami.	0
It's hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city.	0
And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land.	0
My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else.	0
They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves.	0
And that was possible because America is a special country.	0
But that was not an accident.	0
America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done.	0
They solved their problems, they confronted their challenges.	0
They embraced their opportunities.	0
And for over two centuries, each generation has left the next better off.	0
And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part.	0
And I'm telling you tonight, if you vote for me, here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday, when I'm elected president, this generation will do it's part.	0
We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us, what we inherited from our parents, the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz.	0
What an incredible nation we have, that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman, can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support.	0
In just a few months, one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton.	0
And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values?	0
Who will best defend your values and fight for you?	0
"I have to tell you, I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say, ""Madam Secretary, you are asking for a third term of a failed administration."	0
"You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future."""	0
We can do better.	0
We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can keep America safe.	0
That's the choice I will put to her this fall.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Thank you very much.	0
The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it's never known before.	0
They're coming by the millions.	0
We should seize that opportunity.	0
These are great people.	0
These are fantastic people.	0
These are people that love our country.	0
These are people that want to see America be great again.	0
These are people that will win us the election and win it easily.	0
These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job.	0
Because let me tell you, if we lose this election, you're going to have three, four or maybe even five justices and this country will never, ever recover.	0
It will take centuries to recover.	0
So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party.	0
And unify.	0
Be smart and unify.	0
[ applause ]	0
And that concludes this 12th Republican presidential debate.	0
We want to thank the candidates, the Republican National Committee, the University of Miami and, of course, each of you for watching.	0
Okay, thank you very much.	0
It's a great honor to have Nancy Pelosi with us and Chuck Schumer with us.	0
And we've actually worked very hard on a couple of things that are happening.	0
Criminal justice reform — as you know, we've just heard word — got word that Mitch McConnell and the group, we're going to be putting it up for a vote.	0
We have great Democrat support, great Republican support.	0
So, criminal justice reform, something that people have been trying to get — how long, Nancy?	0
Many years.	0
A long time.	0
Many, many years.	0
Looks like it's going to be passing, hopefully — famous last words — on a very bipartisan way.	0
And it's really something we're all very proud of.	0
And again, tremendous support from Republicans and tremendous support from Democrats.	0
And I think it's going to get a very good vote.	0
And we'll see soon enough.	0
But it will be up for a vote very shortly.	0
A lot of years they've been waiting for it.	0
The other thing, the farm bill is moving along nicely.	0
And I guess they'll be voting on Friday or so.	0
But pretty close.	0
Soon.	0
Soon.	0
(Inaudible.)	0
And we think the farm bill is in very good shape.	0
A lot of good things are happening with it, and our farmers are well taken care of.	0
And again, that will be quite bipartisan and it will happen pretty soon.	0
And then we have the easy one, the wall.	0
That will be the one that will be the easiest of all.	0
What do you think, Chuck?	0
Maybe not?	0
"It's called ""funding the government,"" Mr. President."	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
So we're going to see.	0
But I will tell you, the wall will get built.	0
We'll see what happens.	0
It is not an easy situation because the Democrats have a different view, I think, than — I can say — the Republicans.	0
We have great Republican support.	0
We don't have Democrat support.	0
But we're going to talk about that now.	0
We're going to see.	0
One thing that I do have to say is:	0
Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built, and a lot of — a lot of wall.	0
When you include the renovation of existing fences and walls, we've renovated a tremendous amount and we've done a lot of work.	0
In San Diego, we're building new walls right now.	0
And we've — right next to San Diego, we've completed a major section of wall and it's really worked well.	0
So, a lot of wall has been built.	0
We don't talk about that, but we might as well start, because it's building — it's being built right now, big sections of wall.	0
And we will continue that.	0
And one way or the other, it's going to get built.	0
I'd like not to see a government closing, a shutdown.	0
We will see what happens over the next short period of time.	0
But the wall is a very important thing to us.	0
I might put it a different way.	0
Border security is extremely important, and we have to take care of border security.	0
When you look at what happened with the caravans, with the people, with a lot of — we shut it down; we had no choice.	0
We shut it down.	0
But it could be a lot easier if we had real border security.	0
I just want to pay my respects to the Border Patrol agents and officers.	0
They've been incredible.	0
The ICE agents and officers, they've been incredible.	0
And very importantly, our military.	0
Our military went in and they did an incredible job.	0
They have been really, really spectacular.	0
A lot of the people that wanted to come into the country, and really, they were to come in no matter how they wanted to come in — they were going to come in even in a rough way — many of these people are leaving now and they're going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries.	0
They're leaving.	0
If you noticed, it's getting a lot less crowded in Mexico.	0
And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well.	0
So we appreciate that.	0
But they haven't been coming into our country.	0
We can't let people come in that way.	0
So that's pretty much it.	0
We're going to talk about the wall.	0
I wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, just to let you know how positive that is.	0
I want to talk about the farm bill, how positive that is.	0
And I want to talk about the wall.	0
"And I will tell you, it's a tough issue because we are in very opposite sides of — I really think I can say ""border security,"" but certainly the wall."	0
But the wall will get built.	0
A lot of the wall is built.	0
It's been very effective.	0
I asked for a couple of notes on that.	0
If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up.	0
El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up.	0
In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent.	0
Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent.	0
"I mean — and when I say ""dropped,"" the only reason we even have any percentage where people got through is because they walk and go around areas that aren't built."	0
It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is.	0
So, I mean, it's very effective.	0
If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel — 99.9 percent effective.	0
And our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better.	0
So we've done a lot of work on the wall; a lot of wall is built.	0
A lot of people don't know that.	0
A lot of wall is renovated.	0
We have walls that were in very bad condition that are now in A1 tip-top shape.	0
And, frankly, some wall has been reinforced by our military.	0
Our military has done a fantastic job.	0
So the wall will get built, but we may not — we may not have an agreement today.	0
We probably won't.	0
But we have an agreement on other things that are really good.	0
Nancy, would you like to say something?	0
Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way to meet the needs of the American people.	0
I think the American people recognize that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown.	0
You have the White House —	0
"Did you say ""Trump"" — oh, oh."	0
"A ""Trump shutdown."""	0
You have the White House —	0
"I was going to call it a ""Pelosi shutdown."""	0
You have the Senate.	0
You have the House of Representatives.	0
You have the votes.	0
You should pass it right now.	0
No, we don't have the votes, Nancy, because in the Senate, we need 60 votes and we don't have it.	0
No, no, but in the House, you could bring it up right now, today.	0
Yeah, but I can't — excuse me.	0
But I can't get it passed in the House if it's not going to pass in the Senate.	0
I don't want to waste time.	0
Well, the fact is you can get it started that way.	0
The House we can get passed very easily, and we do.	0
Okay, then do it.	0
Then do it.	0
But the problem is the Senate, because we need 10 Democrats to vote, and they won't vote.	0
No, no, that's not the point, Mr. President.	0
The point is —	0
It's sort of the point.	0
— that there are equities to be weighed.	0
And we are here to have a conversation —	0
Correct.	0
— in a careful way.	0
So I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this.	0
But the fact is, the House Republicans could bring up this bill, if they had the votes, immediately, and set the tone for what you want.	0
If we thought we were going to get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately.	0
We would get it passed very easily in the House.	0
No, that's not the point.	0
That's not the point.	0
Nancy, I'd have it passed in two seconds.	0
It doesn't matter, though, because we can't get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes.	0
That's the problem.	0
Well, again, let us have our conversation —	0
That's right.	0
— and then we can meet with the press again.	0
But the fact is, is that legislating — which is what we do —	0
Right.	0
— you begin, you make your point, you state your case.	0
That's what the House Republicans could do, if they had the votes.	0
But there are no votes in the House, a majority of votes, for a wall — no matter where you start.	0
That is exactly right.	0
You don't have the votes in the House.	0
If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them — in one session, it would be done.	0
Well, then go do it.	0
Go do it.	0
It doesn't help because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.	0
No, don't put it on the Senate.	0
Put it on the negotiation.	0
Okay, let me ask you this.	0
Just — and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.	0
It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the House, where I will win easily with the Republicans —	0
You will not win.	0
It doesn't help to take that vote because I'm not going to get the vote of the Senate.	0
Well, don't blame it on the Senate, Mr. President.	0
I need 10 senators.	0
That's the problem.	0
Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate.	0
I have the White House.	0
You have the House of Representatives.	0
The White House is done.	0
And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.	0
But I can't because I need —	0
But you can't — you can't —	0
Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck.	0
All right, let me say something here.	0
Mr. President, let me — let me just say one thing.	0
The fact is you do not have the votes in the House.	0
Nancy, I do.	0
And we need border security.	0
Well, let's take the vote and we'll find out.	0
Nancy.	0
Nancy.	0
We need border security.	0
It's very simple.	0
Of course we do.	0
We need border security.	0
We do.	0
People are pouring into our country, including terrorists.	0
We have terrorists.	0
We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time.	1
Ten.	0
These are very serious people.	0
Our border agents, all of our law enforcement has been incredible what they've done.	0
But we caught 10 terrorists.	0
These are people that were looking to do harm.	0
We need the wall.	0
We need — more important than anything, we need border security, of which the wall is just a piece.	0
But it's important.	0
Chuck, did you want to say something?	0
Yeah.	0
Here's what I want to say:	0
We have a lot of disagreements here.	0
The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much the wall is — how much of the wall is built and how much is there.	0
But that's not the point here.	0
We have a disagreement about the wall —	0
Well, the Washington Post —	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
— whether it's effective or it isn't.	0
Not on border security, but on the wall.	0
We do not want to shut down the government.	0
You have called 20 times to shut down the government.	0
"You say, ""I want to shut down the government."""	0
We don't.	0
We want to come to an agreement.	0
If we can't come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now, and will not shut down the government.	0
And that's what we're urging you to do.	0
Not threaten to shut down the government —	0
Chuck —	0
— because you —	0
You don't want to shut down the government, Chuck.	0
Let me just finish.	0
Because you can't get your way.	0
Because the last time you shut it down you got killed.	0
Yeah.	0
Let me say something, Mr. President.	0
"You just say, ""My way, or we'll shut down the government."""	0
We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government.	0
We urge you to take it.	0
And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.	0
It is good border security.	0
It is very good border security.	0
And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.	0
It's actually what the border security asked for.	0
It's what the border —	0
Because when you look at these numbers of the effectiveness of our border security, and when you look at the job that we're doing with our military —	0
You just said it is effective.	0
Can I be — can I tell you something?	0
Yeah, you just said it's effective.	0
Without a wall — these are only areas where you have the walls.	0
We want to do this —	0
Where you have walls, Chuck, it's effective.	0
Where you don't have walls, it is not effective.	0
Wait a second.	0
Let's call a halt to this.	0
Yeah.	0
Let's call a halt to this.	0
We've come in here as the first branch of government: Article I, the legislative branch.	0
We're coming in, in good faith, to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open.	0
Open.	0
We're going to keep it open —	0
The American —	0
— if we have border security.	0
The American —	0
If we don't have border security, Chuck —	0
I'm with you.	0
— we're not going to keep it open.	0
I'm with you.	0
We are going to have border security.	0
And it's the same border –	0
Effective border security.	0
You're bragging about what has been done.	0
By us.	0
We want to do the same thing we did last year, this year.	0
That's our proposal.	0
If it's good then, it's good now, and it won't shut down the government.	0
Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money.	0
Let's debate —	0
We have taken —	0
Let's debate in private.	0
We have taken this conversation —	0
Okay?	0
Okay.	0
Yeah.	0
— to a place that is devoid, frankly, of fact.	0
And we can dispel that.	0
We need border security.	0
And I think we all agree that we need border security.	0
Yes, we do.	0
Is that right?	0
We do.	0
See?	0
We get along.	0
Thank you, everybody.	0
(Inaudible)	0
Mr. President.	0
You say border security and the wall.	0
Can you have border security without the wall?	0
There's a commonality on border security.	0
No, you need the wall.	0
The wall is a part of border security.	0
Are you re-defining what it means to have border security?	0
Yes.	0
Yeah.	0
We need border security.	0
The wall is a part of border security.	0
You can't have very good border security without the wall, no.	0
That's simply not true.	0
That is a political promise.	0
Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibilities.	1
And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.	1
It totally solves the problem.	0
Again, but I don't want to take this —	0
And it's very important.	0
"Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward from — we came at a place to say, ""How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?"""	0
The economy has — people are losing their jobs.	0
The market is in a mood.	0
Our members are already (inaudible).	0
Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we've had in 50 years.	0
Sixty people of the Republican Party have lost — are losing their offices now because of the transition.	0
People are not — the morale is not —	0
And we've gained in the Senate.	0
Nancy, we've gained in the Senate.	0
The morale —	0
Excuse me.	0
Did we win the Senate?	0
— is not (inaudible).	0
We won the Senate.	0
When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble.	0
I did.	0
Let me say this.	0
We did win North Dakota.	0
This is the most unfortunate thing.	0
We came in here in good faith, and we are entering into this kind of a discussion in the public view.	0
But it's not bad, Nancy.	0
Let us — no, but it's —	0
It's called transparency.	0
I know.	0
But it's not transparency when we're not stipulating to a set of facts.	0
And when we wanted to have a debate with you about saying we'd confront some of these facts  —	0
You know what?	0
We need border security.	0
"— without saying to the public, ""This isn't true."""	0
That's what we're going to be talking about: border security.	0
If we don't have border security, we'll shut down the government.	0
This country needs border security.	0
We agree with that.	0
The wall is a part of border security.	0
(Inaudible.)	0
Let's have a talk.	0
We're going to get the wall built and we've done a lot of wall already.	0
Mr. President, how big a part of border security is the wall?	0
Is that the —	0
It's a big section.	0
It's a big part of it.	0
Is it everything that you need?	0
It's a big part of it.	0
We need to have effective border security.	0
We need a wall in certain parts — no, not in all parts — but in certain parts of a 2,000-mile border, we need a wall.	0
How much money, Mr. President?	0
We are doing it much under budget.	0
We're actually way under —	0
(Inaudible) this conversation.	0
— budget on the areas that we've renovated and areas that we've built.	0
I would say if we got —	0
Do you still need the —	0
— if we got $5 billion, we could do a tremendous chunk of wall.	0
Is that mandatory?	0
Would you accept less though?	0
And are your guests conversely willing to offer more?	0
Well, we're going to see.	0
We're going to see.	0
Look, we have to have the wall.	0
This isn't a question; this is a national emergency.	0
Drugs are pouring into our country.	0
People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many — in many cases, it's contagious.	1
They're pouring into our country.	0
We have to have border security.	0
We have to have a wall as part of border security.	0
And I don't think we really disagree so much.	0
I also know that, you know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand that.	0
And I fully understand that.	0
We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens.	0
Mr. President —	0
But we have to have border security.	0
Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the Leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory.	0
But let me —	0
Elections have consequences, Mr. President.	0
Let me just say —	0
That's right.	0
And that's why the country is doing so well.	0
Let me say this:	0
What the President is representing in terms of his cards over there are not factual.	0
We have to have to an evidence-based conversation about what does work, what money has been spent, and how effective it is.	0
This isn't about — this is about the security of our country.	0
We take an oath to protect and defend, and we don't want to have that mischaracterized by anyone.	0
And we are —	0
I agree with that.	0
— that we are —	0
No, no I agree with that.	0
— we are (inaudible).	0
So let us have a conversation where we don't have to contradict, in public, the statistics that you put forth but instead can have a conversation about what would really work and what the American people deserve from us at this uncertain time in their lives, where they have apprehension.	0
The one thing I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute.	0
And you want to shut it down.	0
You keep talking about it.	0
I — no, no, no, no, no.	0
The last time, Chuck, you shut it down —	0
No, no, no.	0
— and then you opened it up very quickly.	0
Twenty times.	0
Twenty times.	0
And I don't want to do what you did.	0
But, Chuck —	0
"Twenty times you have called for, ""I will shut down the government if I don't get my wall."""	0
None of us have said —	0
You want to know something?	0
You've said it.	0
Okay, you want to put that on my —	0
You said it.	0
I'll take it.	0
Okay, good.	0
You know what I'll say: Yes, if we don't get what we want, one way or the other — whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government.	0
Absolutely.	0
Okay.	0
Fair enough.	0
We disagree.	0
And I am proud — and I'll tell you what —	0
We disagree.	0
I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.	0
So I will take the mantle.	0
I will be the one to shut it down.	0
I'm not going to blame you for it.	0
The last time you shut it down, it didn't work.	0
I will take the mantle of shutting down.	0
That is (inaudible).	0
And I'm going to shut it down for border security.	0
But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.	0
Okay.	0
Thank you very much everybody.	0
Thank you.	0
(Inaudible) shut down the government.	0
Chief of Staff?	0
Have you picked a Chief of Staff, Mr. President?	0
Thank you very much.	0
Yeah, we're interviewing a lot of — we have a lot of great people for Chief of Staff.	0
A lot of people want the job.	0
A lot of people want the job.	0
And I have some great people.	0
A lot of friends of mine want it.	0
A lot of people that Chuck and Nancy know very well want it.	0
I think people you'd like.	0
We have a lot of people that want the job — Chief of Staff.	0
So we'll be seeing what happens very soon.	0
We're in no rush.	0
We're in no rush.	0
Why?	0
Why no rush, Mr. President?	0
Why?	0
Because we have a wonderful Chief of Staff right now.	0
Just no — we are in no rush.	0
Over a period of a week or two, or maybe less, we'll announce who it's going to be.	0
But we have a lot of people that want the position.	0
Thank you very much everybody.	0
Thanks.	0
Good afternoon.	0
Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, members of congress, distinguished guests, on behalf of the first family, welcome to the White House.	0
[Applause]	0
You know it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every day to make America great again.	0
Since the first day of this administration President Donald Trump has been working tirelessly to keep the promises that he made to the American people.	0
President Trump has been reforming healthcare, enforcing our laws, ending illegal immigration, rebuilding our military and this president has been rolling back excessive regulations and unfair trade practices that were stifling American jobs.	0
Thanks to President Trump's leadership, American businesses are growing again, investing in America again, and they're creating jobs in this country instead of shipping jobs overseas.	0
Thanks to President Donald Trump, America is back.	0
[Applause]	0
And just last week, we all witnessed the bold leadership of an American president on the world stage putting America first.	0
From the Middle East to Europe as leader of the free world, President Trump reaffirmed historic alliances, forged new relationships, and called on the wider world to confront the threat of terrorism in new and renewed ways.	0
And by the action the president will announce today, the American people and the wider world will see once again our president is choosing to put American jobs and American consumers first.	0
Our president is choosing to put American energy and American industry first.	0
And by his action today, President Donald Trump is choosing to put the forgotten men and women of America first. So with gratitude for his leadership...	0
[Applause]	0
... and admiration for his unwavering commitment to the American people, it is now my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to all of you the president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
I would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.	0
We're closely monitoring the situation.	0
And I will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time, but it is really very sad as to what's going on throughout the world with terror.	0
Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those affected.	0
Before we discuss the Paris accord, I'd like to begin with an update on our tremendous, absolutely tremendous economic progress since election day on November 8th.	0
The economy is starting to come back and very, very rapidly.	0
We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.	0
I've just returned from a trip overseas where we concluded nearly $350 billion of military and economic development for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.	0
It was a very, very successful trip, believe me.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
In my meetings at the G-7, we have taken historic steps to demand fair and reciprocal trade that gives Americans a level playing field against other nations.	0
We're also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.	0
Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up -- and you see that -- you see it all over -- from the previous administration, including getting many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.	0
Big, big contributions are being made by countries that weren't doing so much in the form of contributions.	0
One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for president, whether it's cutting job- killing regulations, appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice, putting in place tough new ethics rules, achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border, or bringing jobs, plants and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one, until this point, thought even possible.	0
And believe me, we've just begun.	0
The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly even more so.	0
On these issues and so many more, we're following through on our commitments, and I don't want anything to get in our way.	0
I am fighting every day for the great people of this country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord...	0
[Applause]	0
... thank you.	0
Thank you -- but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or an -- really entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.	0
So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair.	0
And if we can, that's great.	0
And if we can't, that's fine.	0
As president, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.	0
The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States, to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories and vastly diminished economic production.	0
Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.	0
This includes ending the implementation of the nationally-determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the United States a vast fortune.	0
Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates.	0
This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs -- not what we need.	0
Believe me, this is not what we need -- including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely -- they rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.	0
According to the same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper, down 12 percent; cement, down 23 percent; iron and steel, down 38 percent; coal, and I happen to love the coal miners, down 86 percent; natural gas, down 31 percent.	0
The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have 7,000 less income, and in many cases, much worse than that.	0
Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.	0
As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscious support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does.	0
The world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters.	0
For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years, 13.	1
They can do whatever they want for 13 years.	0
Not us.	0
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.	0
There are many other examples.	0
But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States.	0
Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America, which it does.	0
And the mines are starting to open up, having a big opening in two weeks, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.	0
A big opening of a brand, new mine.	0
It's unheard of.	0
For many, many years that hasn't happened.	0
They asked me if I'd go.	0
I'm going to try.	0
China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.	0
So, we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.	0
India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.	0
Think of it.	0
India can double their coal production.	0
We're supposed to get rid of ours.	0
Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.	0
In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs.	0
It just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.	0
This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.	0
The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement.	0
They went wild.	0
They were so happy.	0
For the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.	0
A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.	0
We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.	0
We have among the most abundant energy reserves in the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty.	0
Yet under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation, great wealth, phenomenal wealth.	0
Not so long ago we had no idea we had such wealth.	0
And leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.	0
The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.	0
At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand. But at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country...	0
[Applause]	0
... will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts.	0
Our businesses will come to a halt in many cases.	0
And the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.	0
Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations it is estimated it would only produce a two tenths of one degree - think of that, this much - Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.	0
Tiny - tiny amount.	0
In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America and this is an incredible statistic - would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030.	0
After we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.	0
"As ""The Wall Street Journal"" wrote, this morning, ""The reality is that withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate."	0
"The United States under the Trump Administration will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on earth."""	0
We'll be the cleanest.	0
We're going to have the cleanest air.	0
We're going to have the cleanest water.	0
We will be environmentally friendly but we're not going to put our businesses out of work, we're not going to lose our jobs.	0
We're going to grow.	0
We're going to grow rapidly.	0
[Applause]	0
And I think you just read - it just came out minutes ago the small business report.	0
Small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people, one of the best reports they've seen in many years.	0
I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its tax payers.	0
[Applause]	0
So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructionists.	0
We will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and we'll make it good and we won't be closing up our factories and we won't be losing our jobs.	0
And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord and I think the people of sour country will be thrilled.	0
And I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.	0
But until we do that we're out of the agreement.	0
I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issue.	0
But under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.	0
No responsible leader can put the workers and the people of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.	0
The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world's top polluting countries should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wished to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement.	0
It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States.	0
That's not going to happen while I'm president, I'm sorry.	0
[Applause]	0
My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on earth.	0
And with the highest standard of living, and the highest standard of environmental protection.	0
Our tax bill is moving along in Congress and I believe it's doing very well.	0
I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.	0
The Republicans are working very, very hard.	0
We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone, but it's going very well.	0
The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense.	0
They don't put America first.	0
I do and I always will.	0
[Applause]	0
The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lax contributions to our critical military alliance.	0
You see what's happening.	0
It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.	0
At what point does America get demeaned?	0
At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?	0
We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.	0
We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be.	0
They won't be.	0
I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.	0
[Applause]	0
I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests.	0
Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.	0
Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation.	0
The process has begun from day one, but now we're down to business.	0
"Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called ""green climate fund"" -- nice name -- which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments."	0
So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars and we're already way ahead of anybody else.	0
Many of the other countries haven't spent anything.	0
And many of them will never pay one dime.	0
The green fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion.	0
Nobody else is even close.	0
Most of them haven't even paid anything -- including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism.	0
That's where they came.	0
Believe me, they didn't come from me.	0
They came just before I came into office.	0
Not good.	0
And not good the way they took the money.	0
And not good the way they took the money.	0
In 2015, the united nations' departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as peanuts and stated that the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.	0
In 2015, the green climate fund's executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020, and nobody even knows where the money's going to.	0
Nobody's been able to say, where is it going to?	0
Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated.	0
America is $20 trillion in debt-cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers.	0
Or fix vital infrastructure.	0
Millions of our citizens are out of work, and yet under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.	0
So think of that.	0
There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.	0
Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world, should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. Economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives, thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty.	0
[Applause]	0
Our constitution is unique among all nations of the world.	0
And it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.	0
And I will.	0
Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant energy reserves.	0
Which we have started.	0
Very strongly.	0
It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.	0
The risks grow as historically, these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.	0
In other words, the Paris framework is just a starting point.	0
As bad as it is.	0
Not an end point.	0
And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty.	0
And massive future legal liability.	0
Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.	0
As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.	0
The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.	0
It is time to exit the Paris accord.	0
[Applause]	0
And time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.	0
It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France.	0
It is time to make America great again.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Thank you.	0
very much.	0
[Applause]	0
Very important.	0
I'd like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.	0
Scott, please?	0
Thank you Mr. President.	0
Your decision today to exit the Paris accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first.	0
And by exiting you're fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people.	0
Please know that I'm thankful for your fortitude, your courage and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country.	0
America finally has a leader who answers only to the people, not the special interests who had their way for way too long.	0
In everything that you do, Mr. President, you're fighting for the forgotten men and women across this country.	0
You're a cham... you're a champion for the hard working citizens, all across this land, who just want a government that listens to them and represents their interests.	0
You have promised put America first in all that you do, and you've done that in any number of ways, from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to right-sizing Washington DC.	0
And today, you put America first, with regard to international agreements and n the environment.	0
This is an historic restoration of American economic independence, one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes.	0
With this action, we have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again.	0
It should be noted that we as a nation to a better than anyone in the world, in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment.	0
We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.	0
After all, before the Paris accord was ever signed, America reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s.	0
In factm between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18+ percent.	0
And this was corrected accomplished, not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of American private sector.	0
For that reason Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of the world does little.	0
Other nations talk a good game.	0
We lead with action.	0
Not words.	0
[Applause]	0
Our efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation, to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint, to learn from us.	0
That should be our focus, versus agreed to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people.	0
Mr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment, to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what's right by American people.	0
You have that courage.	0
And the American people can take comfort, because you have their backs.	0
Thank you Mr. President.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, folks.	0
Thank you very much, a great honor to be here and I want to thank Chris, so many people have done such an incredible job.	0
And these are real patriots, they really are and they don't get the kind of adulation.	0
But really, they do and we know that.	0
I want to thank Wayne LaPierre.	0
I want to thank my friend, our great Vice President Mike Pence for his terrific remarks.	0
I also want to recognize our great Texas leaders.	0
We love Texas, do we love Texas?	0
Governor Greg Abbott, my friend, where's Greg?	0
Governor Greg Abbott.	0
And he's running, and I've already done it but I will tell you, Greg, I fully endorse you, you are endorsed.	0
He has done a great job.	0
I'll tell you, he would -- you had your water just pouring down on top of you, just kept coming and coming, he kept calling and calling, we need more money, money, money.	0
[Laughter]	0
And you know what?	0
We gave it to you.	0
Fully endorsed.	0
Attorney General Ken Paxton, tremendous guy.	0
And by the way, Ken, you have my full endorsement, and Angela, your wife, has my full endorsement.	0
She just had a big victory.	0
Senator John Cornyn, been with me right from the beginning.	0
John, thank you.	0
Thank you, John.	0
Full endorsement for this man.	0
Ted Cruz, where's Ted?	0
Where's Ted?	0
Thank you.	0
Boy that was very rousing.	0
[Laughter]	0
That's a good sign.	0
Congressman Pete Sessions and Congressman Mike Burgess, great friends.	0
We're also joined by Pete Ricketts, Dana Loesch, Charlie Kirk, Diamond and Silk.	0
Where are you?	0
Where are you?	0
They're so great.	0
Mark Geist, Richard Hutchens, Pete Brownell and Leslie Rutledge, finally I wanted to thank all of you, the true American patriots of the NRA who defend our rights, our liberty and our great American flag, thank you, thank you very much.	0
The people in this hall have never taken our freedom granted.	0
Never.	0
And you have never stopped fighting for our beloved Constitution.	0
Incredible people.	0
Thank you.	0
You give your time, your energy, your vote, and your voice to stand strong for those sacred rights given to us by God, including the right to self defense.	0
And now thanks to your activism and dedication, you'll have an administration fighting to protect your 2nd Amendment, and we will protect your 2nd Amendment.	0
Your 2nd Amendment rights are under siege, but they will never, ever be under siege as long as I'm your president.	0
All of us -- thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
All of us here today are united by the same timeless values.	0
We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator and that no government can ever take it away.	0
We believe in the rule of law.	0
And we support the men and women of law enforcement.	0
We have pride in our history and respect for our heritage.	0
We put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance and we all proudly stand for the National Anthem.	0
We proudly stand.	0
[Audience Chants USA]	0
What people.	0
What great people.	0
[Audience Calls We Love You]	0
And this is your record crowd, you know, all time record crowd.	0
You do know that, so, just remember.	0
Nice to set record.	0
We love our country, and we believe our citizens deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.	0
For the last 15 months, that is exactly what we have been doing.	0
We are all finally putting America first.	0
And we are seeing the incredible results as a result of our massive tax cuts, and everybody is benefiting and everybody is happy.	0
And the Democrats are very concerned.	0
You watch how well we do in '18.	0
You watch.	0
You watch.	0
Get out and vote.	0
Don't be complacent.	0
Don't be complacent.	0
Now, history says that when you win the presidency you get complacent.	0
We all know the feeling.	0
Do you know the feeling?	0
Not too many.	0
[Laughter]	0
Like, 90 percent of the time, you win the presidency and, for whatever reason, you lose the midterm.	0
We can't let that happen.	0
And the word is complacent.	0
You know, I kept thinking to myself, Why is that?	0
I wonder why.	0
Think about it.	0
You win.	0
You have this great win.	0
Now, you take a breath.	0
You relax.	0
All of a sudden, two years is up.	0
They're fighting like hell, and you're complacent.	0
We cannot get complacent.	0
We have to win the midterms.	0
Because since the election, we've created 3.2 million jobs, unthought-of.	0
If we would have said that three years ago, during the campaign, people would have said, What a horrible exaggeration.	0
That's so terrible.	0
They wouldn't have believed it.	0
Three-point-two million.	0
The unemployment rate -- you saw that just today -- just fell beneath four percent for the first time since the beginning of this century.	0
You know, I heard it was about 19 years.	0
I said, Wait a minute.	0
'The beginning of the century' sounds better.	0
So I say, The beginning of the century.	0
[Laughter]	0
More beautiful.	0
[Laughter]	0
African-American unemployment has reached another all-time, in history, record low -- in history.	0
And by the way, Kanye West must have some power because you probably saw, I doubled my African-American poll numbers.	0
We went from 11 to 22 in one week.	0
Thank you, Kanye, thank you.	0
When I saw the number, I said, That must be a mistake.	0
How can that happen?	0
Even the pollsters thought there must be a mistake.	0
[Laughter]	0
No.	0
We've come a long way.	0
You remember, I'd come into big rooms, big audiences, and I'd say, What do you have to lose?	0
Because the Democrats have always had that vote.	0
I said, What do you have to lose?	0
Horrible on crime, horrible on education, horrible on education.	0
I'd say, What do you have to lose?	0
And they voted for me, and we won.	0
But now the numbers are much higher than they ever were with African-American.	0
And we're happy.	0
And the same thing with Hispanic American unemployment, which is also at the lowest level in history -- unemployment, lowest level in history.	0
And women's unemployment -- women, many women -- is at the lowest level in almost 20 years.	0
Think of that.	0
So we have the best employment numbers we've virtually ever had.	0
And yet all we hear about is this phony Russia witch hunt.	0
That's all we hear about, isn't it?	0
[Audience Boos]	0
So just when I'm walking on the stage, a highly respected judge in Virginia made statements.	0
It says -- Wall Street Journal -- it says, Judge Questions Mueller's Authority to Prosecute Manafort.	0
Now, Paul Manafort's a nice guy, but you know, he worked for me for a very short period of time -- literally, for like, what?	1
A couple of months?	1
Little period of time.	1
Then what happens?	0
He worked for Ronald Reagan.	0
He worked for Bob Dole.	0
They worked, I think, as a firm, for John McCain.	0
They worked for others.	0
Does anybody say that?	0
No.	0
But he's out there fighting. On fake news CNN...	0
[Audience Boos]	0
I think NBC may be more distorted and worse, but -- No, but on CNN, they have a headline: Judge in Manafort Case Says Mueller's Aim is to Hurt Trump.	0
Do you believe that?	0
This is what we're up -- It's called the witch hunt.	0
So I just said, Give me that article.	0
I want to read it.	0
Just happened a few minutes before I walked onstage.	0
A federal judge Friday questioned Special Counsel Robert Mueller's authority to bring tax and bank fraud charges unrelated -- unrelated.	0
Nobody knows that.	0
Everyone thinks, Oh...	0
Unrelated to the 2016 election against former Trump campaign manager chairman Paul Manafort.	0
He was there for a short while.	0
But he's a good person.	0
He is.	0
I really believe he's a good person.	0
Judge T.S.	0
Ellis... -- who is really something very special, I hear, from many standpoints.	0
He's a respected person.	0
...suggested the charges before the U.S. district court for the Eastern District of Virginia were just part of the Mueller team's designs to pressure Mr. Manafort into giving up information on President Donald Trump or others in the campaign.	0
I've been saying that for a long time.	0
It's a witch hunt.	0
Then, none of that information has to do with information related to the Russian government coordination and the campaign of Donald Trump.	0
It doesn't have anything to do.	0
It's from years before.	0
Then, How does this have anything to do with the campaign, the judge asks.	0
Let me tell you, folks, we're all fighting battles, but I love fighting these battles.	0
It's really a disgrace.	0
[Inaudible]	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Can you imagine, if we ever called for a rally in Washington, D.C.?	0
There wouldn't be enough room.	0
There wouldn't be enough room.	0
We have a lot of love going on.	0
You know, people don't realize, we have great love going on in this country, great love.	0
It's right here.	0
We have...	0
And -- and by the way, you just saw the recent poll?	0
It came out, the Rasmussen, 51 or 52.	0
It's the highest level I've ever been at.	0
How does that happen when you only get bad publicity?	0
How does that happen?	0
That's because people realize -- That's because people realize that a lot of what you read, and a lot of what you see on television is fake.	0
They realize it.	0
The people are smart.	0
The people are smart.	0
So you have a battle also.	0
You have a battle to keep your rights, and we're going to keep those rights.	0
You're going to be so happy.	0
You have to say.	0
You weren't sure that Trump was going to win, but you all went out there.	0
You all went out there, and you voted.	0
You voted.	0
And there were times they put up that Trump, Pence, Trump, Pence.	0
There were times you say -- a week before they were saying -- I remember they came out with a lot of phony polls.	0
You know that that's called?	0
Suppression.	0
They convince you that you're wasting your time.	0
Why should you vote?	0
Go to a movie instead.	0
Come home watch the results.	0
Very few of the people in this room and in this country did that.	0
And we really had a big night.	0
Remember they said there is no way, Electoral College, there is no way to 270 for me.	0
There is no way to 270 and they were right.	0
But 306 was OK.	0
Crazy.	0
306.	0
So, we had a great time and I think we're doing better now than ever before.	0
I think we're more popular now from the standpoint, now we've produced.	0
You know, when I was running I said we're going to give you tax cuts and by the way, we are decimating Obamacare.	0
We got a bad vote the evening.	0
We got a bad vote the evening that we were going to terminate Obamacare.	0
We got a bad vote.	0
You know about that, right.	0
That was not a nice thing.	0
That was an unexpected vote.	0
But if you look at the massive tax cut bill we also got rid of the individual mandate which is the worse part of Obamacare, right.	0
I don't know if the people in Texas are going to like this but we also got ANWR in Alaska.	0
So I don't know if you're going to like a little competition, but you know what it is?	0
It's called energy for this country.	0
It's called energy.	0
That we like.	0
So, Ted, I think you're happy with that.	0
I think, right?	0
So, we've delivered and when we were running I would say we're going to this, we're going to that, we're going to that.	0
A certain person that's not a very fair person in the media said I have to say Trump has actually delivered more than he promised which is probably the first time people have ever heard that statement.	0
We actually delivered more than we promised and let me just tell you this, we're really doing well with North Korea.	0
We're really doing well.	0
Right.	0
We're doing real well.	0
Remember they said it's going to be terrible.	0
They were actually saying three months ago when the rhetoric was rather sharp, do we agree?	0
I won't use the rhetoric now.	0
Now, I'm trying to calm it down a little bit.	0
So, I'm not going to use the rhetoric.	0
But let's put it this way -- he goes use it.	0
I know you come from Texas whoever the hell you are.	0
Look for years -- for years they've had this problem, and everybody has said, don't talk, don't talk.	0
Don't -- please don't talk.	0
The last administration had a policy of silence.	0
Don't talk.	0
You may make them and him angry.	0
[Laughter]	0
Don't talk.	0
If a horrible statement is made about the United States, don't say anything; we have no comment.	0
Please, please, oh, my God.	0
Same thing with Iran, remember?	0
We're signing that horrible deal and they're marching in the streets, saying Death to America.	0
I said, Who signs a deal when they're marching, saying 'Death to America'?	0
Who marches?	0
They're saying Death to America, and we have the former administration, as -- as represented by John Kerry -- not the best negotiator we've ever seen -- he never walked away from the table, except to be in that bicycle race, where he fell and broke his leg.	0
That's it.	0
[Laughter]	0
That was the only time.	0
I said, Don't tell them you broke your leg.	0
Just stay inside, say you don't want to negotiate.	0
You'll make a much better deal.	0
[Laughter]	0
But he broke his leg.	0
And I learned from that.	0
At 73 years old, you never go into a bicycle race, OK?	0
[Laughter]	0
Just -- you just don't do that.	0
I'm not 73; he was, OK? Just...	0
[Laughter]	0
... but I'll be there.	0
But we have great things going on.	0
And, you know, with respect to North Korea, remember how strong it was?	0
And they were saying, This is going to be nuclear war?	0
We're going to have -- no.	0
You know what gets you nuclear war?	0
Weakness gets you nuclear war.	0
Being weak gets you nuclear war.	0
That's what gets you nuclear war.	0
So let's talk about guns, shall we?	0
Paris, France has the toughest gun laws in the world.	0
The president just left Washington -- Emmanuel, great guy -- nobody has guns in Paris, nobody.	0
And we all remember more than 130 people, plus tremendous numbers of people that were horribly, horribly wounded -- you notice nobody ever talks about that?	0
They talk about the people that died, but they never mentioned that 250 people had horrible, horrible wounds.	0
I mean, they never mention that.	0
But they died in a restaurant and various other close-proximity places.	0
They were brutally killed by a small group of terrorists that had guns.	0
They took their time and gunned them down one by one -- boom, come over here, boom, come over here, boom.	0
If you were in those rooms, one of those people -- and the survivors said it just lasted forever.	0
But, if one employee or just one patron had a gun, or if one person in this room had been there with a gun, aimed at the opposite direction, the terrorists would have fled or been shot.	0
And it would have been a whole different story.	0
I mean, right?	0
Right?	0
We all know what's going on in Chicago.	0
But Chicago has the toughest gun laws in our country.	0
They're so tough.	0
But you know what's happening? It seems that, if we're going to outlaw guns, like so many people want to do-Democrats...	0
[Laughter]	0
... you better get out and vote.	0
Then we will get-and you know what I'm going to say.	0
We are going to have to outlaw, immediately, all vans and all trucks, which are now the new form of death for the maniac terrorists.	0
Right?	0
They take a truck, and they run over 8 people and wound 16, like what happened in New York and what just happened.	0
It's happening all over.	0
So let's ban, immediately, all trucks, all vans, maybe all cars.	0
How about cars?	0
Let's ban them.	0
Let's not sell any more cars.	0
[Audience Member calls out 'I Love You']	0
I love you, too.	0
Thank you.	0
I recently read a story that, in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital-right in the middle-is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds.	0
Yes, that's right.	0
They don't have guns.	0
They have knives.	0
And, instead, there's blood all over the floors of this hospital.	0
They say it's as bad as a military war-zone hospital.	0
Knives, knives, knives-London hasn't been used to that.	0
They're getting used to it.	0
It's pretty tough.	0
We're here today because we recognize a simple fact: The one thing that has always stood between the American people and the elimination of our Second Amendment rights has been conservatives in Congress willing to fight for those rights.	0
And we're fighting.	0
We're fighting.	0
We're fighting to defend our freedom.	0
We need the people in Washington to support our freedom, to support our candidates, to support Ted, to support the people that have to raise their hand.	0
You know, they say we have a majority.	0
We have what?	0
A majority of one person-that's not really a majority.	0
We need Republicans to do it right.	0
To get the kind of things we want, we've got to get Republicans elected.	0
We've got to do great in '18.	0
Those midterms-we have to do them.	0
We need judges who will enforce our laws, protect our sovereignty and uphold our American way of life.	0
The Constitution can't be changed by judges, bureaucrats or the United Nations.	0
That is why we are appointing federal judges who will interpret the law as written.	0
In my first year, I nominated, and the Senate confirmed, more circuit judges than any new administration, by far, in history.	0
And we will have the all-time record very soon.	0
President Obama was very nice to us, because he left us a lot of judges.	0
And I said, That's a lot of judges-like, almost 140.	0
That's a lot of judges.	0
I was very surprised.	0
I was very happy.	0
And we put an incredible new justice on the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch.	0
Yet virtually every single Democrat in the Senate opposed Neil Gorsuch, just like they have consistently opposed judges who will protect your basic freedoms.	0
And, by the way, the way they're slow-walking people that are supposed to be working for us in government... (BOOING)	0
... if you look at what they're doing, in the history of this country there has never been anything like what the Democrats are doing, on great people who gave up their jobs and their lives to take a job as an ambassador, or people working for our government.	1
And they can't get approved because every single one of them is being slow-walked by the Democrats, and it's never happened before.	1
And you know what?	0
I hope we have long memories, but I hope we don't have to worry about it because we're going to be there a long time.	0
So we won't have to worry about that.	0
But what they're doing is disgraceful.	0
What they are doing, Schumer and the group, what they are doing is disgraceful.	0
What they're doing to the wall and immigration is disgraceful.	0
And you just take a look at the border, OK?	0
You take a look.	0
Take a look at what's happening.	0
My administration and conservatives in Congress were elected to uphold your rights.	0
To rebuild our military, which we are doing a great job of rebuilding.	0
To restore our prosperity, to secure our communities and defend our borders.	0
We have the worst immigration laws anywhere in the world.	0
But I'll tell you what.	0
It's not easy for people to come in.	0
I will tell you, it's not-we have the worst laws.	0
After years of defending the borders of other countries-we go into wars with other countries.	0
We shouldn't be there.	0
We go into wars to defend their borders, we don't defend our own borders.	0
And we're going to start defending our country.	0
We're going to start defending our borders.	0
You've all seen, on television, all over the papers.	0
The illegal migrants, pouring up through Mexico, flooding the border.	0
Many from Central America: Honduras, all over the place.	0
Coming up by the thousands.	0
We're stopping them at different fronts.	0
But we don't have laws.	0
We have laws that were written by people that truly could not love our country.	0
Illegal immigration must end.	0
Illegal immigration must end.	0
We are going to have strong borders.	0
I will tell you, we have maxed out every law.	0
We are going to have truly strong-and we're going to take people into our country, but they're going to come in based on merit, not based on picking somebody out of a bin.	1
We are not going to let our country be overwhelmed, and we're going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming C.R.	0
It's going to be very soon, going to be very soon.	0
In recent months, Democratic lawmakers have voted against legislation to close deadly immigration loopholes, like catch-and-release.	1
How about that one?	0
We caught him.	0
Oh.	0
Release him.	0
Bye-bye.	0
[Laughter]	0
Welcome to America.	0
Welcome to America.	0
That's what we have.	0
We're going to keep the violent criminals out.	0
Sentae Democrats like Jon Tester-you saw what happened there.	0
What he did to one of the finest people in our country.	0
What he did to the admiral-what he did is a disgrace.	0
Jon Tester.	0
Bill Nelson and Bob Casey voted against Kate's Law, legislation named for Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a five-time deported illegal immigrant, and you saw what happened with that court case.	0
Can you believe the result of that court case?	0
Can you believe that?	0
The same senators, along with nearly every other Democrat, also voted to protect something that's actually becoming very unpopular, sanctuary cities.	0
Can you believe, finally, people are starting to get it.	0
(BOOING)	0
Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they're releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets.	0
These countries send up their worst.	0
Remember when my opening speech-I got criticized for it, remember?	0
Well, guess what.	0
They're not sending their finest, that I can tell you.	0
We're getting some real beauties in here.	0
But we're taking MS-13, horrible killer gang members, we're getting them out, because our guys are much tougher than theirs.	1
There is not even a little bit of a contest.	0
And that's the only language they understand.	0
That's the only language they understand.	0
These are savage killers.	0
My administration believes our cities should be safe havens for Americans, not sanctuaries for criminals.	0
And we believe that violent gang members must be thrown out of our country immediately, not let to stay, to fester, and to get larger.	0
We get 'em out, and we are kicking 'em out by thousands.	0
If we had the right laws-which we can have very quickly with cooperation-we wouldn't even have a problem.	0
It would be so much better, so much easier.	0
We believe that politicians who put criminal aliens before American citizens should be voted out of office immediately.	0
As we secure our borders, we're also supporting the heroes who fight crime, serve our citizens, and secure our streets, our brave men and brave women in blue.	0
We love them.	0
In my administration, we have a simple policy.	0
We will protect those who protect us.	0
You saw what I did with the military equipment, the excess equipment that was sitting all over the country in warehouses, never to be used again.	0
And other administrations, they just didn't want to give it to the police.	0
They said it's too much protection, it looks too strong, it looks like military.	0
Guess what?	0
It's now being distributed all over to our police forces.	0
And it's better than they could ever buy.	0
You can't buy stuff like that.	0
Today, our love and prayers go out to the family of slain Dallas police officer Rogelio Santander, who last week was murdered in the line of duty very, very close to this arena.	0
We ask God to help the others who were wounded, and they will recover.	0
They will be better.	0
They will be back.	0
Send our love.	0
So important.	0
Thank you.	0
And we mourn together with the entire Dallas Police Department.	0
It's a great police department, a police force that has lost too many heroes, but has never lost its will to protect, and to serve you.	0
We're also taking very strong action to secure and protect our most valuable resource: our children.	0
All of us here today are deeply committed to school safety.	0
Nothing is more important than protecting innocent lives.	0
And I will tell you, Wayne and Chris, and all of the people at the NRA, we speak about it all the time.	0
These are great people.	0
These are great Americans.	0
These people have great heart.	0
They know what they're doing.	0
Our entire nation was filled with shock and grief by the monstrous attack on a high school in Parkland, Florida.	0
We mourn for the victims and their families.	0
Gotten to know members of those families.	0
These are incredible people, and our hearts break for every American who has suffered the horrors of these school shootings.	0
In the aftermath of the terrible attack, I met with the survivors, the parents of school shooting victims at the White House.	0
I was inspired, like all of you were, by their incredible courage.	0
We agreed that it's not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we're making a difference.	0
We must ensure that we actually make a difference, and my administration has pursued an aggressive strategy on community safety.	0
We're working to improve early warning systems so that when the police are called, when the community sees the red flags-which they saw in Parkland all over the place.	0
There has never been a case where more red flags have been shown-swift action is taken by the authorities.	0
Law-abiding gun owners want to keep firearms out of the hands of those who pose a danger to themselves and to others.	0
We all want that.	0
We all want that.	0
I recently signed legislation that includes more than $2 billion to improve school safety, including the funding for training, and metal detectors, and security, and mental health.	0
Mental health is a big one.	0
They don't like to talk about mental health.	0
Mental health-that was the number one example in Parkland.	0
That legislation also made vital improvements to our background check system, which everybody wants.	0
Finally, all of us agree that we must harden certain schools.	0
At the same time, the police have to be able to get into those schools if there's a problem.	0
We want armed guards.	0
We want to be able to get in.	0
I saw some of the craziest plans that I've ever seen.	0
You can spend a fortune on each school.	0
You will spend so much-nobody knows more about construction than I do.	0
You will spend so much, you're going to make it so hard that you can't run a D8 -- you know what that is, right?	0
-- through the doors.	0
It means a tractor.	0
There's only one problem: If one of these maniacs get in, and it's so hard, you can't get in.	0
So you have to be careful.	0
We strongly believe in allowing highly trained teachers to carry concealed weapons if they're highly trained.	0
And we want highly trained security guards.	0
Ninety-eight percent of mass public shootings have occurred in places where guns are banned, just so you understand.	0
Tragically, as we've seen, there's no sign more inviting to a mass killer than a sign that declares, This school is a gun-free zone.	0
Come in and take us.	0
Ninety-eight percent.	0
You know, they're cowards.	0
You saw that in the recent case, where he did all of his damage and then he sort of slinked out of the school.	0
And the policeman outside caught him in a different community.	0
That policeman did a good job.	0
That policeman did a good job.	0
Caught him in a different community.	0
But they are cowards.	0
When they know there's guns inside, they're not going in.	0
We just don't understand that.	0
We can't get that word out.	0
But highly trained people.	0
At the same time, there is no stronger deterrent for a sick individual than the knowledge that their attack will end their life and will end in total failure.	0
When they know that, they're not going in.	0
You're not going to have school attacks.	0
We support the Second Amendment.	0
Not only because we believe in freedom, but also because we trust in everyday, talented, wonderful people.	0
They love our students.	0
And by the way, these teachers, they love their students.	0
They love their students.	0
They understand and they love their students, and they're not going to let anybody hurt their students.	0
But you have to give them a chance.	0
In America, we trust the people to be wise and to be good.	0
We trust them to take responsibility for themselves, their families and their communities.	0
And that is why, in America, we have always trusted the people to keep and bear arms.	0
It is fitting that we gather today in the great state of Texas, a place that cherishes their right like no other.	0
You know, before I left today, a couple of people came up to me.	0
Good political people.	0
They said, You know, going to the NRA convention and speaking today, that'll be very controversial.	0
It might not be popular.	0
You know what I said?	0
Bye-bye, got to get on the plane.	0
[Laughter]	0
Because we have to do the right thing.	0
We have to do the right thing.	0
This proud state would not exist if not for a handful of determined and defiant Texans who refused to surrender their rights nearly two centuries ago.	0
Right?	0
You know who I'm talking about.	0
You know who I'm talking about.	0
In 1835, soldiers from General Santa Ana's army marched into the little Texas town of Gonzales, and ordered those settlers to surrender their small canon they relied on to protect their lives, and protect their homes.	0
The Texans refused.	0
[Inaudible]	0
That's right.	0
They were not about to give up their only means of self defense.	0
In response, Santa Ana's army returned with a large group of additional people.	0
They had men all over the place.	0
The army was big.	0
This time, they were met by dozens of Texans, settlers, soldiers and ordinary citizens who had rushed to Gonzales to defend their rights and their freedom.	0
As Santa Ana's men watched from a distance, those brave Texans raised a flag for all to see, and you know what it said.	0
On the banner, they painted a canon, along with four words that echoed through the ages, and you know what it is.	0
It said, Come and take it.	0
Come and take it.	0
[Audience Chants USA]	0
Like those early Texans, Americans will never surrender, ever, ever, ever.	0
We will never, never surrender.	0
We will never give up our freedom.	0
Americans are born free.	0
We will live free, and we will die free.	0
So again, it is a great honor to be with you, very special people.	0
We truly appreciate your support.	0
I'm going the right thing.	0
I'm doing it for you, but we're doing the right thing.	0
We're doing the right thing together.	0
I want to thank again all of our friends and patriots from the NRA.	0
We will never fail, and we will always protect your Second Amendment.	0
Thank you.	0
God bless you, and God bless America.	0
Thank you all.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much, everybody.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
So we're just going to let the other folks come in, fill it up.	0
This is some crowd.	0
You have to see what's outside, you wouldn't even believe it.	0
[Applause]	0
Unbelievable. So I'm thrilled to be here in Nashville, Tennessee, the home --	0
[Applause]	0
-- of country music, Southern hospitality, and the great President Andrew Jackson.	0
[Applause]	0
I just came from a tour of Andrew Jackson's home to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth.	0
Jackson's life was devoted to one very crucial principle -- he understood that real leadership means putting America first.	0
[Applause]	0
Before becoming President, Andrew Jackson served your state from the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and he also served as commander of the Tennessee militia.	0
Tough cookie.	0
Tough cookie.	0
[Applause]	0
So let's begin tonight by thanking all of the incredible men and women of the United States military and all of our wonderful veterans.	0
The veterans.	0
[Applause]	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
Amazing.	0
There's no place I'd rather be than with all of you here tonight, with the wonderful, hardworking citizens of our country.	0
[Applause]	0
I would much rather spend time with you than any of the pundits, consultants, or special interests, certainly -- or reporters from Washington, D.C.	0
[Applause]	0
It's patriotic Americans like you who make this country run, and run well.	0
You pay your taxes, follow our laws, support your communities, raise your children, love your country, and send your bravest to fight in our wars.	0
[Applause]	0
All you want is a government that shows you the same loyalty in return.	0
It's time that Washington heard your voice -- and believe me, on November 8th, they heard your voice.	0
[Applause]	0
The forgotten men and women of our country will never be forgotten again, believe me.	0
[Applause]	0
I want to thank so many of your state leaders -- State Party Chairman Scott Golden; Congressman Scott DesJarlais; Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn; Congresswoman Diane Black; Congressman Jimmy Duncan -- right from the beginning.	0
[Applause]	0
Governor Bill Haslam.	0
[Applause]	0
A great friend of mine, Senator Bob Corker.	0
[Applause]	0
An incredible guy, respected by all -- Senator Lamar Alexander.	0
[Applause]	0
And so many more.	0
Thank you all for being here.	0
We're going to be working closely together to deliver for you, the citizens of Tennessee, like you've never been delivered for before.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you.	0
We're going to reduce your taxes -- big league.	0
Big.	0
[Applause]	0
Big.	0
I want to start that process so quickly.	0
Got to get the healthcare done.	0
We got to start the tax reductions.	0
[Applause]	0
We are going to enforce our trade rules and bring back our jobs, which are scattered all over the world.	0
They're coming back to our country.	0
[Applause]	0
We're going to support the amazing -- absolutely amazing men and women of law enforcement.	0
[Applause]	0
Protect your freedoms, and defend the Second Amendment.	0
[Applause]	0
And we are going to restore respect for our country and for its great and very beautiful flag.	0
[Applause]	0
It's been a little over 50 days since my inauguration, and we've been putting our America First agenda very much into action.	0
You see what's happening.	0
We're keeping our promises.	0
"In fact, they have signs -- ""He's Kept His Promise."""	0
They're all over the place.	0
I have.	0
[Applause]	0
We have done far more -- I think maybe more than anybody's done in this office in 50 days, that I could tell you.	0
[Applause]	0
And we have just gotten started.	0
Wait until you see what's coming, folks.	0
We've appointed a Supreme Court justice to replace the late, great Antonin Scalia.	0
His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.	0
[Applause]	0
He will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.	0
We are proposing a budget that will shrink the bloated federal bureaucracy -- and I mean bloated -- while protecting our national security.	0
You see what we're doing with our military -- bigger, better, stronger than ever before.	0
You see what's happening.	0
[Applause]	0
And you're already seeing the results.	0
Our budget calls for one of the single largest increases in defense spending history in this country.	1
[Applause]	1
We believe -- especially the people in Tennessee, I know you people so well --	1
[Applause]	1
-- in peace through strength.	1
That's what we're going to have.	0
And we are taking steps to make sure that our allies pay their fair share.	0
They have to pay.	0
[Applause]	0
We've begun a dramatic effort to eliminate job-killing federal regulations like nobody has ever seen before -- slash, slash.	0
We're going to protect the environment, we're going to protect people's safeties, but, let me tell you, the regulation business has become a terrible business, and we're going to bring it down to where it should be.	0
[Applause]	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
Okay, let's go.	0
One person -- and they'll be the story tomorrow -- did you hear there was a protestor?	0
[Applause]	0
We're going to put our miners back to work.	0
We're going to put our auto industry back to work.	0
Already because of this new business climate, we are creating jobs that are starting to pour back into our country like we haven't seen in many, many decades.	0
[Applause]	0
In the first two job reports since I took the oath of office, we've already added nearly half a million new jobs, and believe me, it's just beginning.	0
[Applause]	0
I've already authorized the construction of the long-stalled and delayed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.	0
[Applause]	0
A lot of jobs.	0
I've also directed that new pipelines must be constructed with American steel.	0
[Applause]	0
They want to build them here, they use our steel.	0
We believe in two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.	0
[Applause]	0
On trade, I've kept my promise to the American people, and withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership disaster.	0
[Applause]	0
Tennessee has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since the institution of NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever in history.	0
Our nation has lost over 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization -- 60,000.	0
Think of that.	0
More than that.	0
We're not going to let it happen anymore.	0
From now on, we are going to defend the American worker and our great American companies.	0
[Applause]	0
And if America does what it says, and if your President does what I've been telling you, there is nobody anywhere in the world that can even come close to us, folks.	0
Not even close.	0
[Applause]	0
If a company wants to leave America, fire their workers, and then ship their new products back into our country, there will be consequences.	0
[Applause]	0
That's what we have borders for.	0
And by the way, aren't our borders getting extremely strong?	0
[Applause]	0
Very strong.	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
Don't even think about it.	0
We will build the wall.	0
Don't even think about it.	0
[Applause]	0
In fact, as you probably read, we went out to bid.	0
We had hundreds of bidders.	0
Everybody wants to build our wall.	0
[Applause]	0
Usually, that means we're going to get a good price.	0
We're going to get a good price, believe me.	0
[Applause]	0
We're going to build the wall.	0
Some of the fake news said, I don't think Donald Trump wants to build the wall.	0
Can you imagine if I said we're not going to build a wall?	0
Fake news.	0
Fake, fake news.	0
Fake news, folks.	0
A lot of fake.	0
No, the wall is way ahead of schedule in terms of where we are.	0
It's under design, and you're going to see some very good things happening.	0
But the border by itself right now is doing very well.	0
It's becoming very strong.	0
General Kelly has done a great job -- General Kelly.	0
My administration is also following through on our promise to secure, protect, and defend that border within our United States.	0
Our southern border will be protected always.	0
It will have the wall.	0
Drugs will stop pouring in and poisoning our youth, and that will happen very, very soon.	0
You're already seeing what's going on.	0
The drugs are pouring into our country, folks.	0
They are poisoning our youth and plenty of others, and we're going to stop it.	0
We're not going to playing games.	0
Not going to be playing games.	0
[Applause]	0
Following my executive action -- and don't forget, we've only been here for like -- what?	0
-- 50 days -- we've already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our Southern border; 61 percent since Inauguration Day -- 61 percent.	1
Think about it.	0
And now people are saying, we're not going to go there anymore because we can't get in.	0
So it's going to get better and better.	0
We got to stop those drugs, though.	0
We got to stop those drugs.	0
During the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws.	0
These American victims were ignored by the media.	0
They were ignored by Washington.	0
But they were not ignored by me, and they're not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer.	0
Not going to happen.	0
[Applause]	0
As we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens.	0
One by one -- you're reading about it, right?	0
They're being thrown out of our country.	0
They're being thrown into prisons.	0
And we will not let them back in.	0
[Applause]	0
We're also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism.	0
[Applause]	0
We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino -- hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts.	0
Right now we have investigations going on all over -- hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons.	0
We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS.	0
For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur.	0
[Applause]	0
But let me give you the bad news.	0
We don't like bad news, right?	0
I don't want to hear -- and I'll turn it into good.	0
But let me give you the bad, the sad news.	0
Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii -- part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court -- and I have to be nice; otherwise I'll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts.	0
I'll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world -- I will be criticized -- I'll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.	0
I would never want to do that.	0
A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.	0
Booo --	0
The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.	0
This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit's -- in my opinion -- flawed ruling.	0
This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.	0
The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems -- or she -- or she.	0
Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she.	0
[Applause]	0
When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.	0
So we have a lot of lawyers here.	0
We also have a lot of smart people here.	0
Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration -- and you know what I'm talking about, right?	0
Can I read this to you?	0
Listen to this.	0
Now, we're all smart people.	0
We're all good students -- some are bad students, but even if you're a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you.	0
Ready?	0
So here's the statute -- which they don't even want to quote when they overrule it.	0
And it was put here for the security of our country.	0
And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.	0
And sometimes we need it very badly for security -- security of our country.	0
It says -- now, listen how easy this is.	0
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he -- see, it wasn't politically correct, because it should say he or she.	0
You know, today they'd say that.	0
Actually, that's the only mistake they made.	0
"as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate."""	0
In other words, if he thinks there's danger out there, he or she -- whoever is President -- can say, I'm sorry, folks, not now, please.	0
We've got enough problems.	0
[Applause]	0
We're talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people.	0
[Applause]	0
Now, I know you people aren't skeptical people because nobody would be that way in Tennessee.	0
Right?	0
Nobody -- not Tennessee.	0
You don't think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you?	0
No.	0
Booo --	0
This ruling makes us look weak -- which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me.	0
[Applause]	0
Just look at our borders.	0
We're going to fight this terrible ruling.	0
We're going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.	0
[Applause]	0
We're going to win.	0
We're going to keep our citizens safe.	0
And regardless, we're going to keep our citizens safe, believe me.	0
[Applause]	0
Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz ---- good lawyer -- just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
[Applause]	0
Remember this, I wasn't thrilled, but the lawyers all said, let's tailor it.	0
This is a watered--down version of the first one.	0
This is a watered--down version.	0
And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first one.	0
[Applause]	0
The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.	0
I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless.	0
[Applause]	0
And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me.	0
Not today, not ever.	0
We're going to win it.	0
We're going to win it.	0
[Applause]	0
We're going to apply common sense.	0
We're going to apply intelligence.	0
And we're never quitting, and we're never going away, and we're never, ever giving up.	0
The best way to keep foreign terrorists -- or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists -- from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place.	0
[Applause]	0
We'll take it, but these are the problems we have.	0
People are screaming, break up the 9th Circuit.	0
And I'll tell you what, that 9th Circuit -- you have to see.	0
Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions.	0
Take a look.	0
And this is what we have to live with.	0
Finally, I want to get to taxes. I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but --	0
[Applause]	0
-- but before I can do that -- I would have loved to have put it first, I'll be honest -- there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare.	0
[Applause]	0
If we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state you're down to practically no insurers.	0
You're going to have nobody.	0
You're going to have nobody.	0
And this is true all over.	0
The insurers are fleeing.	0
The insurers are fleeing.	0
It's a catastrophic situation, and there's nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won't be around for a year or two.	0
It's gone.	0
So it's not like, oh, gee, they have this.	0
Obamacare is gone.	0
Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases.	1
It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs.	0
Remember all of the broken promises?	0
You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.	0
Remember the wise guy -- remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people -- the so--called architect -- the American people are stupid because they approved it?	0
We're going to show them.	0
Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare.	0
[Applause]	0
And remember this -- remember this: If we took, because there's such divisiveness -- and I'm not just talking now, with me.	0
There was with Obama.	0
There was with Bush.	0
The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians.	0
I remember years ago, I'd go to Washington -- I* was always very politically active -- and Republicans and Democrats, they'd fight during the day and they go to dinner at night.	0
Today, there's a level that nobody has seen before.	0
Just remember this: If we submitted the Democrats' plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats.	0
That's the way it is.	0
That's how much divisiveness and other things there are.	0
So it's a problem.	0
But we're going to get it by.	0
So, I've met with so many victims of Obamacare ---- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation.	0
At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw -- the government forcing people to buy a government--approved product.	0
There are very few people -- very few people.	0
Booo --	0
By the way -- watch what happens.	0
Now you just booed Obamacare.	0
They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned -- they're bad people, folks.	0
They're bad people.	0
Booo --	0
Tonight, I'll go home, I'll turn on, I'll say -- listen, I'll turn on that television.	0
My wife will say, darling, it's too bad you got booed.	0
I said, I didn't get booed.	0
This was a -- I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare.	0
Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed.	0
But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it.	0
So we'll see.	0
It's the fake, fake media.	0
We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.	0
[Applause]	0
The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we're going to arbitrate, we're going to all get together and we're going to get something done.	0
Remember this -- if we didn't do it the way we're doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.	0
They won't vote, no matter what we do, they're not going to vote.	0
So we're doing it a different way, a complex way.	0
It's fine.	0
The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three -- it's going to be great.	0
It's going to be great.	0
And then, we get on to tax reductions, which I like.	0
[Applause]	0
The House legislation does so much for you.	0
It gives the states Medicaid flexibility.	0
And some of the states will take over their healthcare.	0
Governor Rick Scott in Florida said, just send me the money -- they run a great plan.	0
We have states that are doing great.	0
It gives great flexibility.	0
Thank you, folks.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
It repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes.	0
It provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs.	0
The bill that I will ultimately sign -- and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we're going to get it done -- we'll get rid of Obamacare and make healthcare better for you and for your family.	0
[Applause]	0
And once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three -- I'm going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process.	0
[Applause]	0
We welcome this healthcare debate and its negotiation, and we're going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day -- unlike the way Obamacare was passed.	0
Remember, folks, if we don't do anything, Obamacare is gone.	0
It's not like, oh, gee, it's going to be wonderful in three years.	0
It's gone.	0
It's gone.	0
It's gone.	0
Not working.	0
It's gone.	0
What we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from Democratic leaders in Congress who broke the system in the first place and who don't believe you should be able to make your own healthcare decisions.	0
[Applause]	0
I am very confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country -- not just on healthcare, but all across our government.	0
We will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine.	0
We will give our children the right to attend the school of their choice, one where they will be taught to love this country and its values.	0
[Applause]	0
We will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses, and very importantly for our workers, we're going to lower taxes.	0
[Applause]	0
And we will fight for the right of every American child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing.	0
[Applause]	0
No matter our background, no matter our income, no matter our geography, we all share the same home.	0
We all salute the same flag.	0
And we all are made by the same God.	0
[Applause]	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
USA!	0
It's time to embrace our glorious American destiny.	0
Anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country.	0
All we have to do is tap into that American pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls.	0
And we found that out very recently in our last election -- a lot of pride.	0
[Applause]	0
We are all Americans, and the future truly belongs to us.	0
The future belongs to all of you.	0
This is your moment.	0
This is your time.	0
This is the hour when history is made.	0
All we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together we will make America strong again.	0
[Applause]	0
We will make America wealthy again.	0
We will make America proud again.	0
We will make America safe again.	0
And we will make America great again.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you.	0
God bless you.	0
Thank you.	0
[Applause]	0
God bless you, everybody.	0
[Applause]	0
Thank you.	0
Let us pray.	0
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed is your name.	0
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.	0
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us.	0
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.	0
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever.	0
Amen.	0
Good afternoon.	0
It is my honor and great pleasure to stand here before you as the First Lady of the United States.	0
The mid— the America we envision is one that works for all Americans, and where all Americans can work and succeed.	0
A nation committed to a greater civility and unity between people from all sides of the political divide.	0
I will always stay true to myself and be truthful to you, no matter what the opposition is saying about me.	0
I will act in the best interest of all of you.	0
I am committed to creating and supporting initiatives geared to my heart, which will have impacts on women and children all around the world.	0
My husband is creating a country of great safety and prosperity.	0
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to introduce the President of the United States, Donald Trump.	0
Thank you, everybody, thank you.	0
I didn't know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful, thank you, thank you.	0
It's so great to be here in Florida.	0
My second home with you.	0
This is a state I truly love.	0
This is a state where we all had great victory together.	0
Thank you.	0
It's now been a month since my inauguration.	0
And I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making America great again.	0
I'm also here to tell you about our plans for the future and they're big and they're bold and It's what our country is all about, believe me.	0
I'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people.	0
This was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country our probably anywhere else.	0
This was a truly great movement And I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you.	0
I promise you that.	0
I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.	0
I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news.	0
The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years.	0
They don't get it.	0
By they're starting to get it.	0
I can tell you that.	0
They've become a big part of the problem.	0
They are part of the corrupt system.	0
Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies.	0
When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it.	0
I will do whatever I can that.	0
They don't get away with it.	0
They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda.	0
In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, “nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper.” “Truth itself,” he said, “becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle,” that was June 14, my birthday, 1807.	0
But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.	0
We are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe.	0
We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.	0
We are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.	0
I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver.	0
I promise that.	0
And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time.	0
The White House is running so smoothly.	0
So smoothly.	0
And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess.	0
That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.	0
We will have strong borders again, and I mean that.	0
You've seen it in television.	0
You've seen it on television.	0
General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job.	0
You're seeing it.	0
The gang members, bad, bad people.	0
I said day one, and they're going out.	0
Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here.	0
Bring them back to where they came from.	0
The fact is, you want great schools for your children.	0
You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families.	0
You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
It will be repealed and replaced.	0
For those people.	0
The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast.	0
Okay?	0
Nothing to complain about.	0
Obamacare remember, it is a disaster.	0
You want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal.	0
We're going to put the miners back to work.	0
The miners go back to work.	0
You want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders.	0
You want fair trade deals and a level playing field.	0
We don't have a level playing field.	0
Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the	0
[inaudible]	0
of our politicians.	0
It's not going to happen any longer.	0
You want lower taxes.	0
Less regulation.	0
Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, “Made in the USA.” You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America.	0
And harder for companies to leave.	0
We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired.	0
We're moving to another country.	0
We're going to make the product.	0
Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful.	0
Not going happen anymore.	0
We're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave.	0
They will never, ever leave.	0
And you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office.	0
They're not leaving.	0
And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers.	0
You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest.	0
You want a government that keeps its promises.	0
A great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it.	0
it's sweeping all across the country.	0
Look at what's happening to the stock market.	0
Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country.	0
It's sweeping across the country.	0
And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days this stock market means, companies, have been hitting new highs.	0
They're going to start highs.	0
It's going to be a new day in America.	0
You're going to be proud again.	0
Jobs are already starting to pour back in.	0
They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time.	0
Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country.	0
In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs.	0
I followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it.	0
We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one.	0
None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand.	0
Get mired in and we can't do anything about it.	0
By the way, NAFTA and so many others.	0
My administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers.	0
We're going to end it.	0
Within a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines.	0
Anywhere from 30-40,000 jobs.	0
And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe?	0
Who makes the pipe?	0
Something this audience understands very well, right?	0
Simple question.	0
The lawyers put this very complex document in front.	0
I said, who makes the pipe?	0
They said, sir, it can be made anywhere.	0
I said not anymore.	0
I put a little clause in the bottom.	0
The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line.	0
We believe in two simple rules.	0
I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger.	0
For the big planes.	0
And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd.	0
Not one.	0
Not one.	0
They won't show the crowd.	0
You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much.	0
And just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One.	0
Can you believe this?	0
I said no way.	0
I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane.	0
I refuse.	0
So I got Boeing and it is actually — a lot of people don't know.	0
The Air Force One project is actually two planes.	0
Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project.	0
I got the generals in who are fantastic.	0
I got Boeing in.	0
I told Boeing it's not good enough.	0
We're still not going to do it.	0
The price is still too high.	0
On the fighter jet.	0
We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.	1
Seven years late, great plane.	0
A great plane.	0
So think of it.	0
They're seven years late.	0
Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget.	1
Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well.	0
And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way.	0
I also got Boeing in.	0
I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer.	0
And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them.	0
They would have signed contracts.	0
So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump.	0
That I can tell you.	0
You might as well know about it.	0
Nobody talks.	0
By the way, that's for fighter jets.	0
One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation.	0
The order for the F-35.	0
You've been reading about it because it was a disaster.	0
Under the last administration.	0
A disaster.	0
And now we have it running beautifully.	0
In fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great.	0
Great guy.	0
When he came over, he said, thank you.	0
I said for what.	0
You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet.	0
Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation.	0
So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good.	0
Okay.	0
That's good.	0
I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right?	0
But we believe in two simple rules.	0
Buy American and hire American.	0
We believe it.	0
We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.	0
And by the way, a new director was just approved.	0
Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time.	0
Incredible people.	0
Scott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency.	0
He'll do so good.	0
He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected.	0
They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly.	0
For the most part, they're going to be accepted.	0
They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary.	0
He will be amazing.	0
We're very happy.	0
That took place yesterday.	0
That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations.	0
It was impossible to navigate for companies.	0
And what did it really mean?	0
Forget about the companies?	0
What did it mean.	0
It meant no jobs.	0
It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here.	0
So we're going to have a whole big situation.	0
We are going to unfreeze all of those companies.	0
They are going to be — they're going have freedom.	0
Be able to build what they want to build.	0
It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before.	0
That's going to happen.	0
That was a big thing.	0
We're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement.	0
We're standing up.	0
And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up.	0
I don't say for me.	0
I'm the messenger folks.	0
I'm the messenger.	0
They stood up for us in this last election.	0
We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military.	0
Basically people they wear uniforms like us.	0
Isn't that nice.	0
I saw this man on TV just now, you.	0
I just saw him on television.	0
He said I love Trump.	0
Let Trump do what he has to do.	0
That's my guy right there.	0
Come here.	0
Come here.	0
No, I just.	0
I'm coming in.	0
That's okay.	0
Let him up.	0
I'm not worried about him.	0
I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss.	0
I'm not worried about anything else.	0
This guy is so great.	0
He was one of many people.	0
They're interviewing people in the line.	0
And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man.	0
Come on up here.	0
Come on up.	0
Guy was great.	0
Hop over the fence.	0
Come on.	0
He can do it.	0
He's in good shape.	0
Look at him.	0
Look at this guy.	0
Come on.	0
This guy is great.	0
Don't worry about him.	0
No, no.	0
Come here.	0
They're going to — come on up.	0
Come here.	0
This guy.	0
So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning.	0
I did sir.	0
Say a couple of words to this crowd.	0
Mr. President, thank you sir.	0
We the people, our movement is the reason why our President of the United States is standing here in front of us today.	0
When President Trump during the election promised all these things that he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us.	0
Thank you so much, sir.	0
A star is born.	0
A star is born.	0
That's fine.	0
I wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right?	0
We know our people.	0
Great guy.	0
And so many others.	0
I see some others.	0
Being interviewed.	0
I see them over here.	0
They started.	0
They came at 4 in the morning.	0
The media will give them no credit.	0
The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd.	0
All the way outside of this — this is a big a hanger as you get.	0
All the way outside.	0
Way back to the fences.	0
Amazing.	0
I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody.	0
I've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them.	0
We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now.	0
It's very unfair what's happening.	0
So we want to cherish our law enforcement.	0
We will always protect those who protect us.	0
We've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities.	0
We're going to make our inner cities safe again.	0
Look at what's going on.	0
Look at what's happening in Chicago.	0
Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths.	0
I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places.	0
Safety is a civil right.	0
And we will fight to make America totally safe again.	0
I've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth.	0
We're stopping it.	0
We're stopping it.	0
We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.	0
And I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country.	0
So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing.	0
And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a — yes, it's very sad.	0
The reason is for protection and safety.	0
So the statute is so plain and so clear.	0
I said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its.	0
If you have a high school education, you can understand it.	0
If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.	0
I was told.	0
I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30-page decision by the appellate court.	0
Three judges.	0
And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television.	0
Everything we do gets a lot of people watching.	0
So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good.	0
When they wrote their decision, as I understand it.	0
Maybe I'm wrong.	0
They didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side.	0
So I thought I would read it.	0
And here's what it says.	0
This is what it says: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States” — okay.	0
So essentially.	0
Whenever somebody comes into the United States.	0
Right.	0
“If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States” — okay.	0
Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama.	1
They weren't even picked.	0
They were picked by Obama.	0
“He may,” so the President may, “by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary” — now, because it should have said he or she, right.	0
They were not politically correct when they drew this.	0
In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it.	0
He or she.	0
I don't think the women care too much about that.	0
Right?	0
I don't think so.	0
By the way, we did very well with women.	0
You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls.	0
When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women.	0
We did very nicely with women.	0
We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with.	0
I guess we had to.	0
That's why we're all here tonight.	0
Right?	0
So and it goes, “for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.” So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country.	0
Right?	0
Unbelievable.	0
Unbelievable.	0
And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk.	0
So unfair.	0
So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days.	0
We don't give up.	0
We never give up.	0
We had a court that I disagree with.	0
I disagree with big league — and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand.	0
They're saying how do you come up with that decision.	0
It cannot be more simple.	0
So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious.	0
So we will do something next week.	0
I think you'll be impressed.	0
Let's see what happens.	0
Here's the bottom line.	0
We've got to keep our country safe.	0
You look at what's happening.	0
We've got to keep our country safe.	0
You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden.	0
Sweden, who would believe this.	0
Sweden.	0
They took in large numbers.	0
They're having problems like they never thought possible.	0
You look at what's happening in Brussels.	0
You look at what's happening all over the world.	0
Take a look at Nice.	0
Take a look at Paris.	0
We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people.	1
There was no documentation.	0
There was no nothing.	0
So we're going to keep our country safe.	0
And we all have heart, by the way.	0
And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones.	0
We're going to have those safe zones.	0
We do owe $20 trillion.	0
Okay.	0
So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones.	0
They've got nothing, but money.	0
We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers.	0
Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people.	0
We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us.	0
We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country.	0
We want people that are going to be great for our country.	0
We don't want people with bad, bad ideas.	0
We don't want that.	0
I've also directed the defense community headed by General, now — you know, he said it, he said it — and now Secretary ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS.	0
I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military.	0
We will pursue peace through strength.	0
Our military is badly depleted.	0
You have planes in the military.	0
Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them.	0
Their so old.	0
We make the best equipment anywhere in the world.	0
We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.	0
And we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home.	0
We love our veterans.	0
We're going to do a great job for our veterans.	0
Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated.	0
These are our great great people.	0
We owe them so much.	0
Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all.	0
Our system and our country has led down our veterans.	0
We are not going to let that go on any further.	0
You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans.	0
Thank you veterans.	0
Who is here?	0
Who is a veteran?	0
We're going to take care of our veterans.	0
We're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable.	0
We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.	0
I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.	0
And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people.	0
I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia.	0
His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.	0
He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges.	0
He's incredible and has an incredible resume.	0
He's respected by all.	0
His education is as good as it can get.	0
His writings are truly amazing.	0
He will be a true, true defender of our constitution.	0
So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly.	0
No wonder they're doing so badly.	0
You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency.	0
That didn't happen.	0
They were supposed to take over the Senate.	0
That didn't happen.	0
And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House.	0
It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics.	0
And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans.	0
So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction.	0
They got to get on with it.	0
My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform.	0
We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone.	0
Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially.	0
We're not going let that happen.	0
Also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy.	0
It's a tragedy.	0
You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%.	0
Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it.	0
Obamacare doesn't work.	0
It's become totally unaffordable.	0
Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable.	0
It doesn't work.	0
And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically: don't do anything.	0
Sit back for two years, let it explode.	0
The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people.	0
We have to fix it.	0
And we will.	0
We need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.	0
You're all part of this incredible movement.	0
This movement that we talk about so much.	0
That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world.	0
It's a movement that is just sweeping.	0
It's sweeping across our country.	0
It's sweeping frankly across the globe.	0
Look at Brexit.	0
Look at Brexit.	0
Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at.	0
People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.	0
The nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth.	0
And now we have spirit like we've never had before.	0
It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens.	0
Erasing national borders does not make people safer.	0
It undermines democracy and trade prosperity.	0
We're giving it away.	0
The so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages.	0
Really they are shrinking.	0
18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs.	0
Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away.	0
We don't fight to win.	0
We fight politically correct wars.	0
We don't win anymore.	0
We don't win at trade.	0
We don't win in any capacity.	0
We don't win anymore.	0
We're going to start winning again.	0
Believe me.	0
And we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages.	0
This will be change for the ages.	0
Change like never before.	0
To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity.	0
We want to secure our borders and protect our workers.	0
To rebuild our military and our infrastructure.	0
To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods.	0
To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities.	0
To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce.	0
To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation.	0
And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation.	0
The tired echoes of yesterday's fights.	0
We're fighting battles that no longer help us.	0
We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.	0
I'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries.	0
They're not paying their bills.	0
They're not paying their bills.	0
They have to help us.	0
No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past.	0
No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure.	0
New circumstances demand new solutions.	0
Americans have fought and won wars together.	0
Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives.	0
Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next.	0
Stretching back to the first day of our American independence.	0
This is our legacy.	0
It belongs to all of you.	0
And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.	0
Now is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts.	0
Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country.	0
We are all brothers and all sisters.	0
We share one home.	0
One destiny and one glorious American flag.	0
We are united together by history and by providence.	0
We will make America strong again.	0
I promise.	0
We will make America proud again.	0
We will make America safe again.	0
And we will make America great again.	0
Greater than ever before.	0
May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America!	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.	0
I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.	0
This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.	0
Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.	0
For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic.	0
None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates.	0
The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.	0
No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.	0
No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome.	0
Let's get right to it.	0
The first topic is the Supreme Court.	0
You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.	0
Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.	0
First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?	0
And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?	0
Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?	0
In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.	0
You have two minutes.	0
Thank you very much, Chris.	0
And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.	0
You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	0
What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?	0
What kind of rights will Americans have?	0
And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	0
For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	0
I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	1
But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.	1
That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.	0
And I look forward to having that opportunity.	0
I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.	0
That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.	0
The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.	0
Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
Mr. Trump, same question.	0
Where do you want to see the court take the country?	0
And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?	0
Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	0
The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	0
Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.	0
Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.	0
And she was forced to apologize.	0
And apologize she did.	0
But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	0
We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.	0
I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	1
But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	0
I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.	0
They will have a conservative bent.	0
They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	0
They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.	0
They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.	0
And I believe that's very, very important.	0
I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.	0
It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	0
And those are the people that I will appoint.	0
Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.	0
I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.	0
First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.	0
"Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."""	0
And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.	0
Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.	0
What's wrong with that?	0
Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	0
I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.	0
I represented upstate New York.	0
I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	0
It goes back to the founding of our country.	0
But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	0
Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.	0
And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	1
I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.	0
There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	0
You mentioned the Heller decision.	0
And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	1
And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	0
So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.	0
Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.	0
The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.	0
How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?	0
You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.	0
Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?	0
Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.	0
I watched.	0
I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.	0
And Justice Scalia was so involved.	0
And it was a well-crafted decision.	0
But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.	0
And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.	0
Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.	0
Were you extremely upset?	0
Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	0
But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.	0
That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	0
And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.	0
The gun lobby's on his side.	0
They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	0
And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	0
But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	0
Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.	0
You support a national right to carry law.	0
Why, sir?	0
Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	0
In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	0
So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	0
I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.	0
And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	0
And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.	0
So I'm very honored by all of that.	0
We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.	0
We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.	0
Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.	0
Right.	0
Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.	0
But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?	0
Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.	0
But I'm asking you specifically.	0
Would you like to...	0
If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.	0
But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.	0
Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?	0
Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.	0
And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	0
I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.	0
And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	0
It is about what's happening right now in America.	0
So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.	0
Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	0
He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	0
I will defend Planned Parenthood.	0
I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.	0
Secretary Clinton…	0
And we have come too far to have that turned back now.	0
And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.	1
And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.	0
I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.	0
You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.	0
You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.	0
Why?	0
Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	0
And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	0
The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.	0
I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	0
I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.	0
So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	0
Mr. Trump, your reaction?	0
And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.	0
Well, I think it's terrible.	0
If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	0
Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.	0
But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	0
And that's not acceptable.	0
Well, that is not what happens in these cases.	0
And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	0
You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	0
This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	0
And I do not believe the government should be making it.	0
You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.	0
I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	0
And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	0
And I will stand up for that right.	0
All right.	0
But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...	0
And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	0
Nobody has that.	0
All right.	0
Let's move on to the subject of immigration.	0
And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.	0
Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.	0
Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall.	0
Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border.	0
Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations.	0
Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship.	0
The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?	0
Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.	0
You have two minutes.	0
Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.	0
We need strong borders.	0
In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.	0
You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	0
They're coming in illegally.	0
Drugs are pouring in through the border.	0
We have no country if we have no border.	0
Hillary wants to give amnesty.	1
She wants to have open borders.	1
The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	0
First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.	0
It means their job is tougher.	0
But they know what's going on.	0
They know it better than anybody.	0
They want strong borders.	0
They feel we have to have strong borders.	0
I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	0
The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.	0
All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.	1
It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	1
It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	0
We have to have strong borders.	0
We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	0
We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	0
We need strong borders.	0
We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	0
Now, I want to build the wall.	0
We need the wall.	0
And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.	0
We stop the drugs.	0
We shore up the border.	0
One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	0
We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.	0
And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.	0
But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.	0
Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.	0
Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?	0
Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.	0
They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.	0
And you're right.	0
I don't want to rip families apart.	0
I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	0
I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.	0
We have 11 million undocumented people.	0
They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	0
He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.	1
Now, here's what that means.	0
It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.	0
And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.	0
I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.	0
I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	0
I have been for border security for years.	0
I voted for border security in the United States Senate.	0
And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.	0
But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	0
Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.	0
When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	0
Didn't even raise it.	0
He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	0
So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	0
And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.	0
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
I want to follow up...	0
Chris, I think it's...	0
OK.	0
I think I should respond to that.	0
First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.	0
Very nice man.	0
We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	0
Believe me.	0
The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.	0
It's a disaster.	0
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	1
Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.	0
But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	0
Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...	0
We are a country of laws.	0
We either have -- and by the way...	0
Now, wait.	0
I'd like to hear from...	0
Well -- well, but she said one thing.	0
I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.	0
I voted for border security, and there are...	0
And the wall.	0
There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	0
There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	0
But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	0
Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.	0
And Donald knows a lot about this.	0
He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.	1
"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	0
I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
President Obama has moved millions of people out.	0
Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.	0
But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	0
They've been deported.	0
She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.	0
As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.	0
We're a country of laws.	0
We either have a border or we don't.	0
Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.	0
But it's very unfair.	0
We have millions of people that did it the right way.	0
They're on line.	0
They're waiting.	0
We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.	0
But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.	0
Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	0
You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	0
I want to...	0
But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	0
Secretary Clinton, I want to...	0
We will not have open borders.	0
That is...	0
Well, let me -- Secretary...	0
That is a rank mischaracterization.	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.	0
And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	0
Ronald Reagan was the last president...	0
Secretary Clinton, excuse me.	0
Secretary Clinton.	0
to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	0
Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote.	0
My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.	0
So that's the question...	0
Thank you.	0
That's the question.	0
Please quiet, everybody.	0
Is that your dream, open borders?	0
Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.	0
You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.	0
And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.	0
I think that would be a great benefit to us.	0
But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.	0
And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.	0
They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.	0
Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.	0
This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.	0
So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?	0
Those are the questions we need answered.	0
We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	0
Well?	0
That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?	0
How did we get on to Putin?	0
Hold on -- hold on, wait.	0
Hold on, folks.	0
Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control.	0
Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.	0
So just to finish on the borders...	0
Yes?	0
She wants open borders.	0
People are going to pour into our country.	0
People are going to come in from Syria.	0
She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.	1
They have no idea where they come from.	0
And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	0
She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	0
So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.	0
Now we can talk about Putin.	0
I don't know Putin.	1
He said nice things about me.	0
If we got along well, that would be good.	0
If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.	0
He has no respect for her.	0
He has no respect for our president.	0
And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	0
And she's playing chicken.	0
Look, Putin...	0
Wait, but...	0
from everything I see, has no respect for this person.	0
Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.	0
No puppet.	0
No puppet.	0
And it's pretty clear...	0
You're the puppet!	0
It's pretty clear you won't admit...	0
No, you're the puppet.	0
that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.	1
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	0
We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.	0
We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	1
I find that deeply disturbing.	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
And I think it's time you take a stand...	0
She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.	0
I am not quoting myself.	0
She has no idea.	0
I am quoting 17...	0
Hillary, you have no idea.	0
17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...	0
And our country has no idea.	0
agencies.	0
Yeah, I doubt it.	0
I doubt it.	0
Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.	0
I find that just absolutely...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
Excuse me.	0
Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
He's outsmarted her every step of the way.	0
I do get to ask some questions.	0
Yes, that's fine.	0
And I would like to ask you this direct question.	0
The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.	0
Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?	0
By Russia or anybody else.	0
You condemn their interference?	0
Of course I condemn.	0
Of course I -- I don't know Putin.	0
I have no idea.	0
I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?	0
I never met Putin.	0
This is not my best friend.	0
But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.	0
Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.	0
Whether it's Syria, you name it.	0
Missiles.	0
"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."	0
The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	0
They create warheads, and we can't.	0
The Russians can't believe it.	0
She has been outsmarted by Putin.	0
And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.	0
They've taken over.	0
We've spent $6 trillion.	0
They've taken over the Middle East.	0
She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.	0
We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic.	0
You got about 45 seconds.	0
And she always will be.	0
I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.	0
This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	0
He's...	0
Wrong.	0
advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	1
He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.	0
But here's the deal.	0
The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.	0
There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	0
And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	0
I have 200 generals...	0
Very quickly.	0
and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.	0
As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.	0
We are spending a fortune doing it.	0
They have the bargain of the century.	0
All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.	0
We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.	0
OK.	0
Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.	0
This is just another lie.	0
Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...	0
There's no quote.	0
You're not going to find a quote from me.	0
about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.	0
That kind...	0
And defend yourselves.	0
of language -- well...	0
And defend yourselves.	0
I didn't say nuclear.	0
And defend yourself.	0
The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.	0
Donald wants to tear up our alliances.	0
I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.	0
I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.	0
That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	0
We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy.	0
And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.	0
You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.	0
Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.	0
You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.	0
Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.	0
Yes.	0
We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.	0
But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not.	0
In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.	0
Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.	0
And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.	0
I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.	1
I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.	0
New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.	0
I want us to do more to help small business.	0
That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.	0
I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	0
And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	0
I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	0
That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.	0
I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.	0
And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	0
Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.	0
So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	0
We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.	0
That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	0
By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.	0
Why?	0
Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.	1
So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	0
The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.	0
Secretary, thank you.	0
Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?	0
Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.	1
Her tax plan is a disaster.	0
And she can say all she wants about college tuition.	0
And I'm a big proponent.	0
We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.	0
But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.	0
We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	0
But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.	0
Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	0
We protect Saudi Arabia.	0
Why aren't they paying?	0
She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.	0
Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	0
Because they weren't paying.	0
Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.	0
And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.	0
All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.	0
They have to pay up.	0
We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	0
And I'm a big fan of NATO.	0
But they have to pay up.	0
She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.	0
Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	0
We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	0
We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	0
We're up to $20 trillion.	0
So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.	0
We're going to have a lot of free trade.	0
We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	0
But we have horrible deals.	0
Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.	0
Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.	0
You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.	0
You go upstate New York.	0
Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	0
We're bringing our jobs back.	0
I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.	0
And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.	0
We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	0
And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.	0
We are going to cut taxes massively.	0
We're going to cut business taxes massively.	0
They're going to start hiring people.	0
We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...	0
Time, Mr. Trump.	0
that's offshore back into the country.	0
We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...	0
Mr. Trump?	0
right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.	0
Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...	0
You can't.	0
the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	0
I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	0
I also will not add a penny to the debt.	0
I have costed out what I'm going to do.	0
He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.	0
Well, he mentioned the debt.	0
We know how to get control of the debt.	0
When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.	0
When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	0
He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.	0
So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.	0
So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.	0
That's the kind of approach that will work.	0
Secretary...	0
Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.	0
It has not worked the way that it has been promised.	0
Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.	0
Correct.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.	0
So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?	0
Well, it's a combination, Chris.	0
And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.	0
I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.	0
I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.	0
I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	0
He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	0
But it was a terrible recession.	0
So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.	0
So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.	0
That is not going to work.	0
That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.	0
We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	0
We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.	0
Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...	0
Over a 10-year period.	0
growth is unrealistic.	0
And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry.	0
They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well.	0
Your response, sir?	0
So I just left some high representatives of India.	0
They're growing at 8 percent.	0
China is growing at 7 percent.	0
And that for them is a catastrophically low number.	0
We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	0
And I think it's going down.	0
Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.	0
A terrible jobs report.	0
In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?	0
Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.	0
The report was so bad.	0
Look, our country is stagnant.	0
We've lost our jobs.	0
We've lost our businesses.	0
We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.	0
Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	0
I've visited so many communities.	0
This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.	0
I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.	0
And they cry when they see what's happened.	0
I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.	0
Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.	0
Boy, did they suffer.	0
That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.	0
Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
And she wants it.	0
She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.	1
She totally lied.	0
She did call it the gold standard.	1
And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	0
I was so honored.	0
I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...	0
And that will be as bad as NAFTA.	0
which is Obamacare.	0
But go ahead, briefly.	0
Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.	0
It didn't meet my test.	0
I've had the same test.	0
Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	0
I'm against it now.	0
I'll be against it after the election.	0
I'll be against it when I'm president.	0
There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.	0
He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	0
But he mentioned China.	0
And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.	0
I have fought against that as a senator.	0
I've stood up against it as secretary of state.	0
Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	0
In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	0
So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.	0
Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	0
We're going to pull the country together.	0
We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	0
That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.	0
And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.	0
Let me ask a simple question.	0
She's been doing this for 30 years.	0
Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?	0
No, I voted.	0
You were very much involved -- excuse me.	0
My turn.	0
You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.	0
Very much.	0
And you do have experience.	0
I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.	0
For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.	0
I wouldn't mind.	0
The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.	0
You don't.	0
Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.	1
How do you miss $6 billion?	0
You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.	1
They don't know.	0
It's gone, $6 billion.	1
If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.	0
Believe me.	0
Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.	0
But I think it's really an important issue.	0
He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.	0
You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	0
And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.	0
He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	1
In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.	0
He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.	0
In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.	0
He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.	0
Give me a break.	0
"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	0
So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	0
Well, I think I did a much better job.	0
I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.	0
I started with a $1 million loan.	0
I agree with that.	0
It's a $1 million loan.	0
But I built a phenomenal company.	0
And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.	0
You would even be proud of it.	0
And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.	0
Take a look at the migration.	0
Take a look at Libya.	0
Take a look at Iraq.	0
She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.	1
She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.	1
And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.	0
And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.	0
She's going to get rid of nobody.	0
All right.	0
We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States.	0
Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it.	0
And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.	1
Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?	0
Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse.	0
Mr. Trump, you go first.	0
Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.	1
Those people -- I don't know those people.	0
I have a feeling how they came.	0
I believe it was her campaign that did it.	0
Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	0
She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.	0
They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	0
I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.	0
And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.	0
I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.	0
These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.	0
And I think it's her campaign.	0
Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	0
And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.	0
And that was now all on tape, started by her.	0
I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.	0
If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.	0
But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.	0
It was lies, and it was fiction.	0
Well...	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.	0
And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	0
Now, what was his response?	0
Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.	0
I did not say that.	0
I did not say that.	0
In fact, he went on to say...	0
Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.	0
Her two minutes.	0
I did not say that.	0
It's her two minutes.	0
"He went on to say, ""Look at her."	0
"I don't think so."""	0
"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""	0
"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."	0
Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.	0
He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.	0
So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.	0
That's who Donald is.	0
I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	0
America is great, because America is good.	0
And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
Nobody.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Nobody has more respect...	0
Please, everybody.	0
And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	0
And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.	0
She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.	0
But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	0
We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	0
One lie.	0
She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.	0
He's going to probably go to jail.	0
This is a four-star general.	0
And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	0
That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.	0
And it's not just about women.	0
He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.	0
So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	0
But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.	1
Wrong.	1
He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	0
"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."""	0
He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	0
So it's not one thing.	0
This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.	0
That is not who America is.	0
And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	0
It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.	0
So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.	0
It's on tape.	0
During the last...	0
The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...	0
OK.	0
but those other charges, as she knows, are false.	0
In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate.	0
I'd like to ask you about them.	0
These are questions that the American people have.	0
Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you.	0
Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.	0
Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee?	0
And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?	0
Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.	0
The State Department has said that.	0
I think that's been proven.	0
But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.	0
You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	0
But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.	1
In partnership with the American Health Association...	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	0
Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion.	0
Well, it is an open discussion.	0
And you...	0
And the specific question went to pay for play.	0
Do you want to talk about that?	0
Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I think that it's been very well...	0
Let's ask Mr. Trump.	0
There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...	0
It's been very well studied.	0
and the high rankings...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Please let me Mr. Trump speak.	0
and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	0
Please let Mr. Trump speak.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
It's a criminal enterprise.	0
Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.	1
You talk about women and women's rights?	0
So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.	0
These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.	1
And yet you take their money.	0
So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	1
Why don't you give back the money?	0
I think it would be a great gesture.	0
Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.	0
And you take a look at the people of Haiti.	0
I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	0
And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.	0
And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.	0
I'm very proud of that.	0
We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.	0
And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	1
I mean, who does that?	0
It just was astonishing.	0
But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	0
The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.	0
Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.	0
The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.	0
We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.	0
And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	0
All right.	0
because it's an important part of the American experience.	0
They don't want you to help them anymore.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I'd like to mention one thing.	0
Trump Foundation, small foundation.	0
People contribute, I contribute.	0
The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	0
I don't get anything.	0
I don't buy boats.	0
I don't buy planes.	0
What happens -- the money goes to them.	0
Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?	0
No, it was -- we put up the American flag.	0
And that's it.	0
They put up the American flag.	0
We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.	0
Right.	0
But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...	0
There was.	0
There was.	0
And, by the way...	0
instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.	0
the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	0
I want to get into one...	0
But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.	0
He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.	1
You can look at our tax returns.	0
We've got them all out there.	0
But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	0
And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.	0
You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	0
So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	0
I find that just astonishing.	0
I want...	0
So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.	0
And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	1
We...	0
Let me just explain.	0
But, no, we heard this...	0
Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.	0
Mr. Trump, we -- OK.	0
You know what she should have done?	0
Folks, we heard this...	0
And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	0
Folks, we heard this...	0
because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	0
Well, you know...	0
You should have changed the law.	0
But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.	0
I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...	0
Made with Chinese steel.	0
But I will tell you, I sat there...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.	0
All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.	0
And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	0
Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic.	0
You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.	0
"Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- ""will absolutely accept the result of this election."""	0
Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing.	0
I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?	0
I will look at it at the time.	0
I'm not looking at anything now.	0
I'll look at it at the time.	0
What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.	0
First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.	0
The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.	0
It's so dishonest.	0
And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.	0
But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.	0
I think they're going to see through it.	0
We'll find out on November 8th.	0
But I think they're going to see through it.	0
But, sir, there's...	0
If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	1
So let me just give you one other thing.	0
So I talk about the corrupt media.	0
I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.	0
She shouldn't be allowed to run.	0
It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	0
She should not be allowed to run.	0
And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	0
But...	0
Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.	0
But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner.	0
Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.	0
Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?	0
What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	0
I'll keep you in suspense.	0
OK?	0
Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	0
You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	0
The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	0
They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	0
He lost the Iowa caucus.	0
He lost the Wisconsin primary.	0
He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	0
Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.	0
There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	1
Should have gotten it.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
This is -- this is a mindset.	0
This is how Donald thinks.	0
And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.	0
OK.	0
So that is not the way our democracy works.	0
We've been around for 240 years.	0
We've had free and fair elections.	0
We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.	0
And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.	0
You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Hold on.	0
Hold on, folks.	0
Hold on, folks.	0
it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	0
And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	0
He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	0
And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.	0
I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.	0
I think it's a disgrace.	0
All right.	0
I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Hold on, folks.	0
This doesn't do any good for anyone.	0
Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.	0
The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun.	0
If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?	0
And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.	0
Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?	0
Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment.	0
You have two minutes.	0
Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	0
But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.	0
I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	0
In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.	0
The goal here is to take back Mosul.	0
It's going to be a hard fight.	0
I've got no illusions about that.	0
And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.	0
I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	0
But we know we've got lots of work to do.	0
Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.	0
So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	0
That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.	0
If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.	0
Mr. Trump, same question.	0
If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?	0
Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	0
We had Mosul.	0
But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.	0
Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	0
The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.	0
About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.	0
Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?	0
We announce we're going after Mosul.	0
I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	0
These people have all left.	0
They've all left.	0
The element of surprise.	0
Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.	0
So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.	0
All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.	0
But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	0
And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	0
They want to look good.	0
He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	0
That's why we have the great migration.	0
But she wanted to look good for the election.	0
So they're going in.	0
But who's going to get Mosul, really?	0
We'll take Mosul eventually.	0
But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.	0
Much, much tougher.	0
Much more dangerous.	0
Going to be more deaths that they thought.	0
But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	0
They say, what do we need this for?	0
So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	0
And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.	0
Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.	0
So we're now going to take Mosul.	0
And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	0
Iran.	0
Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.	0
But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.	0
You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	0
You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	0
Sir, your two minutes are up.	0
The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.	0
Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	1
I said it was a mistake.	1
I've said that years ago.	1
He has consistently denied what is...	1
Wrong.	0
a very clear fact that...	0
Wrong.	0
before the invasion, he supported it.	0
And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.	0
"Google ""Donald Trump Iraq."""	0
And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	0
Wrong.	0
And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.	0
Now, why does that matter?	0
Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.	0
I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	0
But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.	0
Mosul is a Sunni city.	0
Mosul is on the border of Syria.	0
"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice."	0
We need to go after the leadership.	0
But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	0
There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.	0
They've been digging underground.	0
They've been prepared to defend.	0
It's going to be tough fighting.	0
But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.	0
This is what we have to do.	0
I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.	0
You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.	0
Chris, we don't gain anything.	0
He has all the conspiracy theories...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Iran is taking over Iraq.	0
Secretary Clinton, it's...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Iran is taking over Iraq.	0
We don't gain anything.	0
This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.	0
If they did it by surprise...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion.	0
He says...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
We could have gained if they did it by surprise.	0
Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.	0
unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.	0
No, you are the one that's unfit.	0
You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.	0
He said some beauties.	0
And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	0
You do.	0
And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	0
If you think that was good, then you do.	0
Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.	0
Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.	0
I agree with both.	0
Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	0
And he has said...	0
Which is a big mistake.	0
as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.	0
I think he's right.	0
Let's turn to Aleppo.	0
Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo.	0
And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir.	0
You said that Aleppo has basically fallen.	0
In fact, there -- in fact, there are...	0
It's a catastrophe.	0
I mean...	0
It's a catastrophe, but there...	0
it's a mess.	0
There are a quarter of...	0
Have you seen it?	0
Have you seen it?	0
Sir...	0
Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	0
Sir, if I may finish my question...	0
OK, so it hasn't fallen.	0
Take a look at it.	0
Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.	0
That's right.	0
And they are being slaughtered...	0
Yes.	0
because of bad decisions.	0
If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS.	0
In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo.	0
Would you like to clear that up, sir?	0
Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	0
It's a humanitarian nightmare.	0
But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	0
I mean, what do you need, a signed document?	0
Take a look at Aleppo.	0
It is so sad when you see what's happened.	0
And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	0
And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.	0
He -- he aligned with Russia.	0
He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	0
We gave them $150 billion back.	1
We give them $1.7 billion in cash.	0
I mean, cash.	0
Bundles of cash as big as this stage.	0
We gave them $1.7 billion.	0
Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.	0
They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.	0
We don't know who the rebels are.	0
We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	0
We don't know who the rebels are.	0
And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.	0
But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.	0
If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.	0
And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	0
Let me...	0
in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.	0
And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	0
Lots of luck, Hillary.	0
Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	0
Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there.	0
President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.	0
And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia.	0
So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns?	0
Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?	0
Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.	0
I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	0
This would not be done just on the first day.	0
This would take a lot of negotiation.	0
And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.	0
We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	0
So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	0
But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.	0
He's made these claims repeatedly.	0
I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.	0
But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	0
That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.	0
And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	0
That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	0
In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.	0
So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.	0
And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.	0
Folks, I want to get into our final segment.	0
But I just have to...	0
Real quick.	0
It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.	0
We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	0
And right now, they're in 32 countries.	0
OK.	0
We should have -- wait one second.	0
They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.	0
A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.	0
And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	0
We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.	0
They are outplayed.	0
Now, she wasn't there.	0
I assume she had nothing to do with it.	0
But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.	0
Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.	0
Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.	0
Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent.	0
That's the highest since just after World War II.	0
But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.	0
Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.	0
The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?	0
Mr. Trump, you go first.	0
Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.	0
And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	0
But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	0
And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.	0
I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.	0
And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	0
We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.	0
To do that, we're taking back jobs.	0
We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.	0
It's very sad.	0
But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.	0
We used to be there.	0
We've given it up.	0
We've become very, very sloppy.	0
We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	0
You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.	0
But we don't use those people.	0
Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.	0
We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	0
We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	0
We use political hacks.	0
We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.	0
So we have to use our great people.	0
But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	0
And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	0
And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great."	0
"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."	0
You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	0
He was criticizing President Reagan.	0
"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage."	0
But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.	0
I do not add a penny to the national debt.	0
I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.	0
So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.	0
We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	0
And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.	0
In fact, I think just the opposite.	0
We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	0
We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.	0
That's where growth will come from.	0
That's why I want to invest in you.	0
I want to invest in your family.	0
And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.	0
And we just have a big disagreement about this.	0
It may be because of our experiences.	0
You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...	0
Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	0
I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.	0
We've heard this before.	0
And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	0
Time.	0
Thank you, Hillary.	0
Could I just respond?	0
Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...	0
Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.	0
I disagreed with him.	0
We should have been much tougher on trade even then.	0
I've been waiting for years.	0
Nobody does it right.	0
OK.	0
And frankly, now we're going to do it right.	0
All right.	0
The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.	0
Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.	0
So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?	0
I'm cutting taxes.	0
We're going to grow the economy.	0
It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.	0
That's not going to help in the entitlements.	0
No, it's going to totally help you.	0
And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
It's destroying our country.	0
It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.	0
We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	0
If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.	0
But Obamacare has to go.	0
It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.	1
Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.	0
And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	0
Bad health care at the most expensive price.	0
We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money.	0
Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?	0
Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	0
My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	0
But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...	0
Such a nasty woman.	0
by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.	0
I will not cut benefits.	0
I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	0
But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	0
That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.	0
And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.	0
The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.	0
So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	0
What we need to do is go after...	0
Your husband disagrees with you.	0
the long-term health care drivers.	0
We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.	0
I have a plan for doing that.	0
And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	0
This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign.	0
I would like to end it on a positive note.	0
You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.	0
So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president.	0
This is another new mini-segment.	0
Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first.	0
Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	0
We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	0
You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.	0
And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	0
I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	0
That's what my mission will be in the presidency.	0
I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	0
I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.	0
I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	0
Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.	0
Doesn't work that way.	0
But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.	0
"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""	0
We're going to make America great.	0
We have a depleted military.	0
It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	0
We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	0
We don't take care of our veterans.	0
We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	1
That can't happen.	0
Our policemen and women are disrespected.	0
We need law and order, but we need justice, too.	0
Our inner cities are a disaster.	0
You get shot walking to the store.	0
They have no education.	0
They have no jobs.	0
I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.	0
All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.	0
We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.	0
Thank you both.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton -- hold on just a moment, folks.	0
Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.	0
That brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.	0
We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us.	0
Now the decision is up to you.	0
While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away.	0
One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote.	0
It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country.	0
Thank you, and good night.	0
Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders, you can now move to your lecterns while I explain a few ground rules.	0
As moderator, I'll guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups.	0
You'll also get questions from Dana Bash and Errol Louis.	0
You'll each have one minute and 15 seconds to answer questions, 30 seconds for follow- ups.	0
Timing lights will signal when your time is up.	0
Both candidates have agreed to these rules now.	0
Opening statements, you'll each have two minutes.	0
Let's begin with Senator Sanders.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Wolf, thank you very much.	0
CNN, thank you very much.	0
Secretary Clinton, thank you very much.	0
When we began this campaign almost a year ago, we started off at 3 percent in the polls.	0
We were about 70 points behind Secretary Clinton.	0
In the last couple of weeks, there were two polls out there that had us ahead.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Of the last nine caucuses and primaries, we have won eight of them, many of them by landslide victories.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Over the last year, we have received almost 7 million individual campaign contributions, averaging -- guess what -- $27 apiece, more individual campaign contributions than any candidate in American history at this point in a campaign.	0
The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth.	0
And the truth is that this country is not going to move forward in a significant way for working people unless we overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... and unless we have real campaign reform so that billionaires and super PACs cannot buy elections.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
This campaign is also determined to end a rigged economy where the rich get richer and everybody else get poorer, and create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.	0
Thank you.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, first of all, it's great to be here in New York, and I am delighted to...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... have this chance to discuss the issues that are important to our future.	0
I was so honored to serve as a senator from New York for eight years...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... and to work to provide opportunity for all of our citizens to make it possible that we could knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead.	0
And during those eight years, we faced some difficult challenges together.	0
We faced 9/11.	0
We worked hard to rebuild New York.	0
I was particularly concerned about our first responders and others who'd been affected in their health by what they had experienced.	0
We worked hard to bring jobs from Buffalo to Albany and all parts of New York to give more hard-working people a chance to really make the most out of their own talents.	0
And we worked hard to really keep New York values at the center of who we are and what we do together.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And that is -- that is exactly what I want to do as your president.	0
We will celebrate our diversity.	0
We will work together, bringing us back to being united, setting some big, bold, progressive goals for America.	0
That's what I'm offering in this campaign, to build on the work, to build on the value that we share here in New York, to take those to Washington, and to knock down those barriers that in any way hold back not only individual Americans, bur our country from reaching our full potential.	0
That is what my campaign is about.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised.	0
I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.	0
Senator Sanders, in the last week, you've raised questions about Secretary Clinton's qualifications to be president.	0
You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.	0
So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?	0
Well, I've known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?	0
We worked together in the Senate.	0
And I said that in response to the kind of attacks we were getting from the Clinton, uh, campaign.	0
"Washington Post headline says ""Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified"" and that's what the surrogates were saying."	0
Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?	0
Of course she does.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But I do question...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- but I do question her judgment.	0
I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.	0
And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.	0
I don't believe that that is...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.	0
I've been called a lot of things in my life.	0
That was a first.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And then he did say that...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- he had to question my judgment.	0
Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- and...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So, look, we have disagreements on policy.	0
There's no doubt about it.	0
"But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the ""New York Daily News,"" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks."	0
When asked, he could not explain how...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
-- that would be done and...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- when asked...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.	0
I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.	0
Senator...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And let's talk about judgment.	0
Yes!	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I led the opposition to that war.	0
Secretary Clinton voted for that.	0
Well, let's talk about judgment.	0
Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.	0
Where does the money come from?	0
Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?	0
I don't think so.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Well, let me...	0
We have...	0
-- let me just say...	0
-- (INAUDIBLE)...	0
-- let me -- let me say...	0
Madam Secretary, let him finish.	0
OK.	0
Thirdly, we have got to understand that in America, we should be thinking big, not small.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you.	0
We need to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people.	0
So I...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- my (INAUDIBLE).	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Secretary?	0
Well, make -- make no mistake about it, this is not just an attack on me, it's an attack on President Obama.	0
President Obama...	0
(BOOS)	0
You know, let me tell you why.	0
You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why.	0
President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.	0
President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.	0
And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- on Wall Street in many a year.	0
So this is -- this is a phony -- this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.	0
Thank, Secretary.	0
We're going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.	0
Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis.	0
This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans.	0
So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks?	0
Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?	0
Absolutely.	0
You know, this is what I've saying for the past year.	0
No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.	0
I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank.	0
I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.	0
I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.	0
There are two sections there.	0
If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.	0
Let's look at what is at stake here.	0
We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.	0
I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.	0
I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law.	0
We've got to execute under it.	0
So, you're right.	0
I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.	0
The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...	0
...	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up.	0
"You said, quote, ""That's their decision."""	0
Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?	0
First, Dana...	0
when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?	0
That's right.	0
So, let's start off with the basic premise.	0
A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars.	0
What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.	0
Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.	0
Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.	0
But, Senator...	0
The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.	0
But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?	0
Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.	0
You've got to be a certain size.	0
And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off.	0
I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions.	0
What we need is to make sure that they are safe.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Dana, you know -- I love being in Brooklyn.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.	0
Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.	0
That has to be the judgement of the regulators.	0
But, there's another element to this.	0
I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.	0
Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
And hold them accountable as well.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street.	0
Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?	0
Sure.	0
Sure.	0
The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.	0
That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that.	0
Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So the problem response -- the proper response in my view is we should break them up.	0
And that's what my legislation does.	0
Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
It is important -- it's always important.	0
It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.	0
I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.	0
I called them out on their mortgage behavior.	0
I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.	0
When I went to the secretary of state office, the president -- President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.	0
That is the law.	0
Now, this is our ninth debate.	0
In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law.	0
You don't just say, we're upset about this.	0
I'm upset about it.	0
You don't just say, go break them up.	0
You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.	0
Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough.	0
We've got to include the shadow banking sector.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton called them out.	0
Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.	0
And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements?	0
So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.	0
Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference.	0
These banks, in my view, have too much power.	0
They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.	0
If elected president, I will break them up.	0
We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs.	0
So I'd like to ask you, so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You know, first of all -- first of all, there isn't an issue.	0
When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks.	0
I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.	0
I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.	0
Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture.	0
It was a giant insurance company, AIG.	0
It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers.	0
It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.	0
I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...	0
Madam Secretary...	0
... but the fact is he did.	0
And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator Sanders, one second, please.	0
Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Why not release them?	0
I have said, look, there are certain -- there are certain expectations when you run for president.	0
This is a new one.	0
And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it -- because there are speeches for money on the other side.	0
I know that.	0
But I will tell you this, there is -- there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go -- you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns.	0
And I've released 30 years of tax returns.	0
And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton, we're going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, you're running now for the Democratic nomination.	0
Right.	0
And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts.	0
It's not about the Republicans...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You know, let's set the same standard for everybody.	0
When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns.	0
Everybody does it, and then we move forward.	0
Thank you.	0
Well, let me respond.	0
Secretary Clinton, you just heard her, everybody else does it, she'll do it.	0
I will do it.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents.	0
There were no speeches.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And second of all, of course we will release our taxes.	0
Jane does our taxes.	0
We've been a little bit busy lately.	0
You'll excuse us.	0
But we will...	0
Senator...	0
We will get them out.	0
Senator...	0
Well, you know, there are a lot of copy machines around.	0
Senator, when are you -- when are you -- you've been asked for weeks and weeks to release your tax returns.	0
Well, I think we got one that's coming out tomorrow.	0
Which one?	0
Last year's.	0
2014?	0
Yes.	0
What about 2013, all the other ones?	0
You'll get them, yes.	0
Yeah, look, I don't want to get anybody very excited.	0
They are very boring tax returns.	0
No big money from speeches, no major investments.	0
Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.	1
And that's what that will show.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?	0
Yes.	0
And what about the earlier ones? What's the problem...	0
Yes.	0
What's taking so long?	0
Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them.	0
And she's been out on the campaign trail.	0
We will get them out.	0
We'll get them out very shortly.	0
It's not a big deal.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator, Senator, you've slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States.	0
Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses.	0
"He says you are, quote, ""uninformed on this issue"" and disconnected from reality."	0
Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?	0
Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And this is -- this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country.	0
This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary.	0
That's his -- that's his compensation.	0
This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and -- and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs.	0
He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
All right.	0
Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?	0
First of all, the word contempt is not right.	0
There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Verizon happens not to be one of them.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who's the head of General Electric, he doesn't like me, well, that's fine.	0
He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits.	0
(BOOS)	0
But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class.	0
So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America's middle class and poor?	0
Well, for a start, we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those.	0
That has got to change.	0
Thank you.	0
Secretary...	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
-- Secretary Clinton?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach.	0
And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.	0
I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.	0
I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business.	0
And that's exactly what I will do.	0
When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.	0
So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting -- more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America.	0
And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.	0
I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...	0
Senator...	0
-- in the 1990s, we got 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.	0
Thank you.	0
Let's do that again in America.	0
Senator, how do you...	0
I'm going to respond...	0
I'll have you respond in a moment.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Stand by.	0
Well, look...	0
Secretary Clinton... (CROSSTALK)	0
You will respond in a moment, but I have to follow-up with Secretary Clinton.	0
You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour.	0
But you do not support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.	0
As president...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- if a Democratic Congress put a $15 minimum wage bill on your desk, would you sign it?	0
Well, of course I would.	0
And I have supported...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- I have supported the fight for 15.	0
I am proud to have the endorsement of most of the unions that have led the fight for 15.	0
I was proud to stand on the stage with Governor Cuomo, with SEIU and others who have been leading this battle and I will work as hard as I can to raise the minimum wage.	0
I always have.	0
I supported that when I was in the Senate.	0
Well, look...	0
But what I have also said is that we've got to be smart about it, just the way Governor Cuomo was here in New York.	0
If you look at it, we moved more quickly to $15 in New York City, more deliberately toward $12, $12.50 upstate then to $15.	0
That is exactly my position.	0
It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.	0
Thank you.	0
Go as quickly as...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
-- to get to $15.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You know, wait a minute...	0
(INAUDIBLE).	0
-- wait a minute.	0
(INAUDIBLE).	0
-- wait, wait...	0
That's just not accurate.	0
Well...	0
Come on, I have stood on the debate stage...	0
-- well and I...	0
-- with Senator Sanders eight...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
-- times.	0
Excuse me.	0
I have said the...	0
Well...	0
Exact same thing.	0
Secretary, Senator, please.	0
If we can...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
-- raise it to $15 in New York...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
-- or Los Angeles or Seattle...	0
Secretary, the viewers...	0
-- let's do it.	0
If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you.	0
OK.	0
So please...	0
I will...	0
-- don't talk over each other.	0
I believe I was...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Go ahead.	0
-- responding.	0
All right?	0
When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15.	1
Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12.	1
There's a difference.	0
And, by the way, what has happened is history has outpaced Secretary Clinton, because all over this country, people are standing up and they're saying $12 is not good enough, we need $15 an hour.	0
OK.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Go ahead, Secretary.	0
Secretary?	0
And suddenly...	0
Secretary, go ahead.	0
To suddenly...	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you very much.	0
To suddenly announce now that you're for $15, I don't think is quite accurate.	0
All right.	0
Secretary?	0
All right.	0
I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15.	0
I supported those on the front lines of the fight for -- it happens to be true.	0
I also -- I supported the $15 effort in L.A.	0
I supported in Seattle.	0
I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.	0
The minimum wage at the national level right now is $7.25, right?	0
We want to raise it higher than it ever has been, but we also have to recognize some states and some cities will go higher, and I support that.	0
I have taken my cue from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who has said we will set a national level of $12 and then urge any place that can go above it to go above it.	0
Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference.	0
Thirty-five million people will get a raise.	0
One in four working mothers will get a raise.	0
I want to get something done.	0
And I think setting the goal to get to $12 is the way to go, encouraging others to get to $15.	0
But, of course, if we have a Democratic Congress, we will go to $15.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator, go ahead.	0
Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people.	0
I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Now, in fact -- in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage.	0
That's good.	0
I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And ultimately what we have got to determine is after massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent, when millions of our people are working longer hours for low wages...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
I think we have got to be clear, not equivocate, $15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible.	0
Thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We're going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America.	0
"Secretary Clinton, you've said that Vermont, Senator Sanders' home state, has, quote, ""the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York."""	0
But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont.	0
Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York's gun violence?	0
No, of course not.	0
Of course not.	0
This is -- this is a serious difference between us.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And what I want to start by saying -- it's not a laughing matter -- 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year.	0
I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.	0
So, yes, we have a problem in America.	0
We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby.	0
We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And what we have here is a big difference.	0
Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.	0
He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.	0
Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield.	0
He said they didn't deserve their day in court.	0
I could not disagree more.	0
And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That has this kind of special protection.	0
We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree.	0
We've got to hold Wall Street accountable...	0
...	0
Thank you...	0
... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America?	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
Senator?	0
Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question.	0
You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible.	0
You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence.	0
You made the point what she said was totally absurd.	0
I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence.	0
She said no.	0
But, go ahead.	0
Then why did she put out that statement?	0
I put it out...	0
...	0
Excuse me, I think I'm responding now.	0
Please, go ahead sir.	0
A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.	0
Here is the fact on guns.	0
Let's talk about guns.	0
That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook -- what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.	0
Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont.	0
I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what?	0
We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.	0
I've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you.	0
(CHEERING)	0
Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?	0
Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.	0
They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.	0
But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.	0
He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.	0
And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said.	0
He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.	0
So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.	1
Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.	0
Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this.	0
You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.	0
The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology.	0
Do you?	0
What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.	0
Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.	0
But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in.	0
They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.	0
So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?	0
No, I don't think I owe them an apology.	0
They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today.	0
They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.	0
Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.	1
This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.	0
And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.	0
And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.	0
What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.	0
New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.	0
Thank you.	0
The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
Senator, go ahead.	0
Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.	0
Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.	0
It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.	0
Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?	0
Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.	0
And you mentioned some of them.	0
The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.	0
So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.	0
On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.	0
I think that sentences got much too long.	0
The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.	0
So we have a problem.	0
And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.	0
So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.	0
So that's how I see it.	0
And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.	0
"Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, ""I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake."""	0
"Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadn't heard it then, quote, ""it's clearly insufficient."""	0
Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?	0
Well, look, I supported the crime bill.	0
My husband has apologized.	0
He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders...	0
But what about you, Senator?	0
... voted for it.	0
I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.	0
I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.	0
That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make.	0
And I also want people...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... especially I want -- I want white people -- I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism.	0
It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill.	0
Why did you call him out?	0
Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right.	0
We had a crime bill.	0
I voted for it.	0
It had the Violence Against Women Act in it.	0
When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence.	0
This took us a good step forward.	0
We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook.	0
This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.	0
But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system.	0
We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.	0
And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.	0
And that means, for a start -- and we don't talk about this.	0
The media doesn't talk about it -- you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed.	0
You know what I think?	0
Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I'll tell you what else.	0
And I'll tell you what else I think.	0
And that is, we have got -- and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it.	0
We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs.	0
Too many lives...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period.	0
And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Let's -- let's get Secretary Clinton's response.	0
Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said.	0
I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.	0
And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York.	0
We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.	0
That's why I want a good teacher in a good school for every child, regardless of the ZIP Code that child lives in...	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.	0
Your time's up, Secretary Clinton.	0
Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this.	0
So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration.	0
To fulfill that promise, you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners.	0
How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?	0
We're going to work with state governments all over this country.	0
And you know what?	0
In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.	0
With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities.	0
On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support.	0
We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
We have to take a quick commercial break.	0
We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
Welcome back.	0
Let's turn to another critically important issue.	0
Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.	0
Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.	0
You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.	0
What are his lies?	0
Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.	0
And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.	0
But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.	0
And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.	0
"And everyone who's looked at this independently, ""The Washington Post"" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge."	0
So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.	0
Best we can tell from the reports that are done.	0
But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.	0
And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.	0
Thank you.	0
We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.	0
It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers.	0
I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country.	0
But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Now, that's not saying -- and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount.	0
That's true.	0
But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.	0
Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
And, it is not good enough.	0
You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it.	0
That was what 9/11 was about.	0
We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances.	0
There's going to be international conflict.	0
(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...	0
... Thank you...	0
... Including a tax on carbon.	0
Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond.	0
Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.	0
Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough.	0
You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...	0
... Thank you...	0
(APPLAUSE CHEERING)	0
... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism...	0
... Go ahead, Senator...	0
... Let's talk about that.	0
When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world.	0
(CHEERING)	0
The issue here -- of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there.	0
We've got to get beyond paper right now.	0
We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday.	0
(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.	0
Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land.	0
That's not Secretary Clinton's position.	0
Thank you.	0
Let us support a tax on carbon...	0
... Secretary Clinton...	0
... Not Secretary Clinton's position.	0
... Go ahead and respond.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant.	0
He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And, you know, I am getting a little bit -- I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
Now, it's easy -- it's easy to diagnose the problem.	0
It's harder to do something about the problem.	0
And...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
We'll continue on this.	0
Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead with your question.	0
Wolf.	0
Wolf.	0
We're going to continue on this.	0
Errol, go ahead.	0
OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described.	0
Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas.	0
Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.	0
Why have you changed your view on fracking?	0
No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.	0
And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.	0
So we did say natural gas is a bridge.	0
We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.	0
That's why I've set big goals.	0
I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
All right, Senator?	0
All right, here is -- here is a real difference.	0
This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Not right now.	0
Not on climate change.	0
Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world.	0
Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And that means -- and I would ask you to respond.	0
Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.	0
I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed.	0
I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.	0
That's exactly what I have proposed.	0
OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton.	0
And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator Sanders, you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security.	0
Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.	0
Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator...	0
Are you for a tax on carbon or not?	0
I have a question for you.	0
You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security.	0
You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking.	0
You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S.	0
But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?	0
No, they wouldn't.	0
Look, here's where we are.	0
Let me reiterate.	0
We have a global crisis.	0
Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course.	0
Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation.	0
It is absolutely true.	0
There will be some people who lose their job.	0
And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers.	0
It is not their fault...	0
It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.	0
But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency -- urgently and boldly.	0
What does that mean?	0
Senator -- senator, jobs...	0
Yes?	0
-- jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up...	0
Well, you don't phase...	0
-- that difference?	0
-- it all out tomorrow.	0
And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow.	0
But this is what you do do.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program -- and I had introduced -- introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops.	0
We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country.	0
(CHEERING)	0
Saving -- rebuilding our rail system.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Our mass transit system.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war -- you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism.	0
That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.	0
Thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Lead the world.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Let's turn to another critically important issue...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- the issue of national security and foreign policy.	0
Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed.	0
You were his secretary of State.	0
Aren't you also responsible for that?	0
Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise.	0
And here's what we did.	0
We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.	0
I was very proud of that.	0
We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.	0
We also worked to help them set up their government.	0
We sent a lot of American experts there.	0
We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.	0
They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.	0
And so we were caught in a very difficult position.	0
They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.	0
And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.	0
And we can't walk away from that.	0
We need to be working with European and Arab partners...	0
Thank you.	0
-- with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.	0
The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.	0
And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them	0
Senator, go ahead.	0
"According to ""The New York Times."	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?	0
"The New York Times"" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change."	0
And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Look...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs.	0
No debate about that.	0
But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.	0
Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold.	0
And I think if you studied the whole history of...	0
Yes.	0
-- American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.	0
Secretary, we're going to let you respond.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Yes, well, I...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- I...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- I -- I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.	0
Senator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.	0
No.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
We went to the United Nations -- yes, he did.	0
We went to the United Nations Security Council.	0
We got support from the Security Council.	0
And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.	0
This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.	0
And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.	0
Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator, go ahead.	0
Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer.	0
What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?	0
Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy.	0
But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after.	0
Totally different issue.	0
Well, that isn't...	0
Second of all -- second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria...	0
Senator, let her respond to that, then we'll get to that.	0
Go ahead, Secretary.	0
There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.	0
So, yes, it was unanimous.	0
That's exactly right, including you.	0
And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.	0
The decision was the president's.	0
Did I do the due diligence?	0
Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?	0
Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president?	0
Yes, I did.	0
That's what a secretary of state does.	0
But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.	0
And the president made that decision.	0
And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
Go ahead, Senator.	0
If you listen, you know -- two points.	0
Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again.	0
But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.	0
Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.	0
Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.	0
Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.	0
Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.	0
The president said no.	0
Now, that's how it works.	0
People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.	0
So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.	0
And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.	0
Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.	0
"Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO."""	0
Do you still feel that way?	0
Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.	0
Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.	0
Yes, I do.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share.	0
So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?	0
Well, you got to ask -- you got to ask Trump.	0
All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.	0
So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.	0
You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden.	0
Nothing wrong with that.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
I support our continuing involvement in NATO.	0
And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.	0
There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.	0
But there's a larger question here.	0
NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.	0
It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.	0
So...	0
But, Madam Secretary...	0
... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.	0
That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined.	0
If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?	0
I will stay in NATO.	0
I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.	0
Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.	0
Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan.	0
They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.	0
That meant a lot.	0
And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.	0
With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.	0
Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
Senator, let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel.	0
"Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, ""disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life."""	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?	0
Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack.	0
That is not a debate.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But -- but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that.	0
Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism.	0
But we had in the Gaza area -- not a very large area -- some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.	0
Free Palestine!	0
Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
And, let me say something else.	0
As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run -- and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
So what is not to say -- to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%.	0
You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated.	0
I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.	0
That does not make me anti-Israel.	0
That paves the way, I think...	0
Thank you, Senator...	0
...to an approach that works in the Middle East.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
Thank you.	0
Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?	0
I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.	0
I did it in concert with...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.	0
I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks.	0
They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.	0
And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.	0
So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.	0
You have a right to defend yourself.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That does not mean -- that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions.	0
And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.	0
It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...	0
Thank you...	0
... just let me finish.	0
The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.	0
And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
Thank you, Senator, go ahead -- go ahead, Senator.	0
I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country.	0
That is not the issue.	0
And, you evaded the answer.	0
You evaded the question.	0
The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism.	0
That's not the debate.	0
Was their response disproportionate?	0
I believe that it was, you have not answered that.	0
(CHEERING)	0
I will certainly be willing to answer it.	0
I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.	0
(AUDIENCE REACTION)	0
I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible.	0
It would be great -- remember, Israel left Gaza.	0
They took out all the Israelis.	0
They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.	0
And what happened?	0
Hamas took over Gaza.	0
So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
Senator.	0
I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC.	0
I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people.	0
Almost none in that speech.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.	0
That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.	0
Well, if I -- I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.	0
And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.	0
There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me.	0
Three long meetings.	0
And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.	0
I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.	0
And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
A final word, Senator, go ahead.	0
There comes a time -- there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Well...	0
Secretary.	0
... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders.	0
Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.	0
If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.	0
Senator, go ahead.	0
You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians.	0
And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.	0
All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided.	0
There are two sides to the issue.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
We have to take another quick, quick break.	0
But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York.	0
That is coming up right after this.	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.	0
We're here in Brooklyn.	0
Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans.	0
Senator Sanders, you're promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges.	0
The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt.	0
How is this fiscally responsible?	0
Well, first of all, I disagree with that study.	0
There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.	0
For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French.	0
My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs.	0
Public colleges and universities tuition free?	0
Damn right.	0
That is exactly what we should be doing.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I'd pay for that -- I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.	0
Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent.	0
The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Secretary, go ahead and respond.	0
Well, again -- again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years.	0
Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare.	0
And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.	0
And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable.	0
We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families.	0
There's no doubt about that.	0
But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... are actually going to work.	0
And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out -- remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years.	0
He changed in the middle of this campaign.	0
He put out another plan.	0
People have been analyzing the new plan.	0
And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals.	0
In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor.	0
A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.	0
The same for free college.	0
The free college offer -- you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print.	0
You read the fine print, and here's what it says.	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
The fine print says this, that it will -- the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors...	0
Senator, go ahead.	0
Thank you.	0
... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.	0
I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.	0
Secretary please.	0
We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.	0
I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know?	0
It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country.	0
They're doing OK.	0
They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people.	0
We can do the same.	0
In terms of public colleges and universities, please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing.	0
Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime?	0
For trying to get an education.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
So, yes, we are going to pay for it...	0
Well...	0
Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, go ahead.	0
We have -- we have a difference of opinion.	0
We both want to get to universal health care coverage.	0
I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress.	0
So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody...	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
... let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.	0
Secretary, let's talk about Social Security, another critically important issue.	0
Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits.	0
Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500?	0
Yes or no, would you lift the cap?	0
I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
That is one way.	0
If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.	0
But there are other ways.	0
We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people.	0
We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.	0
But here's the real issue, because I -- I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it.	0
I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security.	0
I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.	0
But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now.	0
And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.	0
And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security...	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
-- system and that will be my highest priority.	0
Senator?	0
Go ahead, Senator.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
An interesting comment, but you didn't answer the question.	0
I did.	0
If that's the way we're...	0
No, you didn't.	0
My legi...	0
-- yes, I did.	0
Can I answer...	0
I did answer the...	0
-- may I please...	0
Well, don't -- don't put words...	0
-- can I have... (CROSSTALK)	0
-- into my mouth and say something...	0
-- do I not?	0
-- that's not accurate.	0
Go ahead, Senator.	0
All right.	0
Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes (INAUDIBLE)...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Now, we've got -- here is the issue.	0
Your answer has been the same year after year.	0
In fact, the idea that I'm bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn't my idea.	0
It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008, the exact same idea.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher -- it's at 118 -- and starting at 250 and going on up.	0
If you do that, you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.	0
You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year.	0
What's wrong with that?	0
Are you prepared to support it?	0
I have supported it.	0
You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator.	0
You have sup...	0
I think it's important...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- to point out that...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- you know, we're -- we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
Think about what the other side wants to do.	0
They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.	0
They still want to privatize it.	1
In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.	1
All right, so...	0
So, yes, we both want to make sure...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Look, Wolf...	0
-- Social Security (INAUDIBLE)...	0
-- I am very glad that...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
-- and well-funded...	0
I am very glad to...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Senator, go ahead.	0
-- campaign of challenging, if I hear you correctly, Madam Secretary, you are now coming out finally in favor of lifting the cap on taxable income...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- and extending and expanding Social Security.	0
If that is the case, welcome on board.	0
I'm glad you're here.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
No.	0
Thank you.	0
Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We are going...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- we are...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- we are going...	0
Secretary...	0
I -- as he said, I've said the same thing for years.	0
I didn't say anything different tonight.	0
We are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
There is still something called Congress.	0
Now, I happen to support Democrats and I want to get Democrats to take back the majority in the United States Senate...	0
Errol...	0
-- so a lot of -- a lot of what we're talking about can actually be implemented...	0
Errol, hold on a second.	0
-- when I am president.	0
Secretary...	0
Go ahead.	0
Hold on, Errol...	0
-- I'm still...	0
-- Errol.	0
Hold on.	0
I've got to admit...	0
Go ahead, Senator.	0
-- maybe I'm a little bit confused.	0
Are you or are you not supporting legislation to lift the cap on taxable income and expand Social Security for 58 years and increase benefits...	0
I am...	0
-- yes or no?	0
I have said yes, we are going to pick the best way or combination...	0
Oh, you -- ah.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(BOOS)	0
OK.	0
-- or combination of ways...	0
(BOOS)	0
-- you know...	0
(BOOS)	0
-- it -- it's all -- it's always a little bit, uh, challenging because, you know, if Senator Sanders doesn't agree with how you are approaching something, then you are a member of the establishment.	0
Well, let me say then...	0
Well, look...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- let me say this...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
-- we are going to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
We've got some good ideas to do it.	0
Let's get a Congress elected...	0
Thank you.	0
-- that will actually agree...	0
Well, thank you...	0
-- with us in doing it.	0
Errol, go ahead.	0
OK, Secretary Clinton, I've got a question for you from a reader...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Let me interject here.	0
"-- of the ""New York Daily News."""	0
Yes, Secretary Clinton...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
-- you are a member of the establishment.	0
-- this was a reader...	0
(INAUDIBLE).	0
"-- of ""The Daily News"" who sent us a..."	0
(CHEERING)	0
-- a question for you.	0
Just a second, Senator.	0
Hannah Green (ph) wants to know your position, Secretary Clinton, regarding President Obama's nomination of Merrick Gaarland to the Supreme m Court.	0
President Obama said earlier this week that he would not withdraw the nomination, even after the presidential election.	0
If elected, would you ask the president to withdraw the nomination?	0
I am not going to contradict the president's strategy on this.	0
And I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals.	0
I fully support the president.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I believe that the president -- the president is on the right side of both the Constitution and history.	0
And the Senate needs to immediately begin to respond.	0
So I'm going to support the president.	0
When I am president, I will take stock of where we are and move from there.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
Well, there is no question.	0
I mean, it really is an outrage.	0
And it just continues, the seven-and-a-half years of unbelievable obstructionism we have seen from these right-wing Republicans.	0
I mean, a third-grader in America understands the president of the United States has the right to nominate individuals to the U.S. Supreme Court.	0
Apparently everybody understands that except the Republicans in Congress.	0
So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?	0
Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate.	0
But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think -- I think this.	0
I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined.	0
You know, there is no doubt that the only people that I would ever appoint to the Supreme Court are people who believe that Roe V. Wade is settled law and Citizens United needs to be overturned.	0
And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake.	0
We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth.	0
We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question.	1
(APPLAUSE)	0
And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women's rights.	0
We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished.	0
And we are never asked about this.	0
And to be complete in my concern, Senator Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction.	0
I don't think it's a distraction.	0
It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.	0
Senator Sanders, your response.	0
You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose, who will take on those governors right now who are discriminating outrageously against the LGBT community, who comes from a state which led the effort for gay marriage in this country, proudly so.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Who not only thinks we are not going to -- not defund Planned Parenthood, we've got to expand funding for Planned Parenthood.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders, you've spoken a lot tonight about your votes in Congress.	0
You have been in Congress for over a quarter of the century, and there as an independent, not a Democrat.	0
Now you're seeking the Democratic nomination, but Secretary Clinton has suggested that she's not even sure you are a Democrat.	0
Are you?	0
Well, why would I be running for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States?	0
But here is a good point.	0
You know, in virtually all of the general election match-up polls between Trump and Secretary Clinton and Trump and Bernie Sanders, in almost all of those polls, I do better than Secretary Clinton both in the CNN poll I was 20 points ahead of Trump.	0
I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points.	0
And you know why?	0
Because in fact a whole lot of people -- this may be a shock to the secretary, but there a whole lot of independents in this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Senator Sanders...	0
And we are not going to win the White House based on just long-term Democratic votes.	0
We have got to reach out to independents and I think I am well qualified to do that.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I am in this race as a Democrat.	0
I have raised millions of dollars for my colleagues in the United States Senate to help them get elected.	0
I will do everything I can to open the Democratic party to the young people who are flocking into our political campaign.	0
(CHEERING)	0
On that very subject, on that very subject, Secretary Clinton mentions electing a Democratic congress several times.	0
She says that she raised $15 million for the Democratic party in the first three months of this year.	0
You don't appear to have raised any money for the party.	0
Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you.	0
Why aren't you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead?	0
The truth is, and you can speak to my colleagues, we have raised millions of dollars to the DSCC.	0
I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that's just not accurate.	0
But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And, I think the future of the Democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors.	0
I think that the way we are doing it in this campaign...	0
...	0
Thank you Senator.	0
$27 a contribution...	0
...	0
Senator, your time is up...	0
SANDERS; not being dependent on Wall Street, or big money, that is the future of the Democratic Party that I want to see.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
Thank you, Senator Sanders.	0
Secretary Clinton.	0
Let us talk about where we are in this race.	0
I've gotten more votes than anybody running.	0
9.6 million at the last count.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
That is 2.3 million more than Senator Sanders.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
I think you have to look at the facts.	0
And, the facts are that I'm putting together a very broad-based, inclusive coalition from the South to the North, from the East to the West, with African-American, Latinos, women, union households, working people and I am very proud of the campaign we are running.	0
It is a campaign that will not only capture the Democratic nomination, but a campaign that will defeat whoever the Republican end up nominating.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
Thank you, Madam Secretary.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)	0
And, I want to say -- I also want to say that I do -- I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process.	0
I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders.	0
We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.	0
But, let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the Democratic party when the nomination process has been completed...	0
... Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
And, I know something about that...	0
... Secretary Clinton...	0
Thank you so much.	0
Because, when I went to the very end of the 2008 campaign with then Senator Obama...	0
...Secretary Clinton, you're out of time...	0
... We did unify the party, and we did elect a Democratic president...	0
...Senator Sanders, on that note....	0
... Let me, if I may just briefly say something...	0
...	0
Senator Sanders, I want to ask you a question about this, and you can incorporate that into your response.	0
Three months now between now and the Democratic convention.	0
Your campaign manager says that you will absolutely take the fight to the floor if neither you nor Secretary Clinton clinches the nomination with pledged delegates alone.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Do you vow to take this fight to Philadelphia no matter what?	0
I think we're going to win this nomination to tell you the truth.	0
(CHEERING)	0
Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true.	0
Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South.	0
No question about it.	0
We got murdered there.	0
That is the most conservative part of this great country.	0
That's the fact.	0
But you know what?	0
We're out of the Deep South now.	0
And we're moving up.	0
We got here.	0
We're going to California.	0
We got a number of large states there.	0
And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination, and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Now, let me say this...	0
Secretary Clinton, go ahead.	0
I think it's -- I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates.	0
And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me.	0
And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter.	0
I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.	0
So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday.	0
I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California.	0
And when we end up with the number of delegates we need, we will unite the party and have a unified convention...	0
Senator, go ahead.	0
... that we'll go onto the general election with.	0
The reason -- the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people -- and I'm not just talking about very young.	0
You know, the older you get, the younger young gets -- 45 or younger -- is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And people understand, you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests.	0
So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
... many of whom previously had given up.	0
Thank you, Senator, very much.	0
The candidates, they will make their final pitches to New York voters right after this.	0
Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.	0
It's time for the candidates' closing statements.	0
Each candidate will have two minutes.	0
Senator Sanders, you're first.	0
I grew up in Brooklyn, New York...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
... the son of an immigrant who came to this country from Poland at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket, never made a whole lot of money, but was a very proud American, because this country gave him and my mom the opportunity to send their kids to college.	0
I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life.	0
And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country.	0
I just don't accept that.	0
What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.	0
And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That is what the political revolution is about.	0
That is what this campaign is about.	0
And with your help, we're going to win here in New York.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Thank you.	0
I am very grateful for the fact that the people of New York gave me the great honor of serving as your senator.	0
You took a chance on me in 2000, and then you re-elected me with one of the biggest margins we've had in our state in 2006.	0
During those years, we worked closely together.	0
I tried to have your back, and time and time again, you had mine.	0
We took on the challenges of 9/11 together.	0
We got the money to rebuild New York.	0
We came to the aid of our brave first responders, construction workers, and others who endangered their own health by helping to save lives and search for survivors.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We worked to create jobs -- despite the disastrous policies of George W. Bush -- across New York.	0
And we stood up time and time again against all kinds of vested powerful interests.	0
I'm asking for your support again in the primary on Tuesday to continue that work together, to take what we did in New York and to take those New York values to the White House, and put them to work on behalf of all of our people, to knock down the barriers that stand in the way.	0
You know, of course we have economic barriers.	0
I've been fighting against those trying to even the odds most of my adult life.	0
But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.	0
So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday.	0
I'll work my heart out for you again.	0
And together, we won't just make promises we can't keep.	0
We'll deliver results that will improve the lives of the people in New York and in America.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
That's what we'll do together.	0
Thank you, New York.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you, Secretary.	0
Thank you very much, Senator.	0
I want to thank the candidates for a really terrific debate.	0
Thanks also to Dana Bash and Errol Louis, as well as NY1, the Democratic National Committee, and everyone here at the Duggal Greenhouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.	0
Stay with CNN now for complete coverage of the New York primary next Tuesday.	0
Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign, live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.	0
I'm Megyn Kelly...	0
[ applause ]	0
... along with my co-moderators, Brett Baier and Chris Wallace.	0
Tonight...	0
[ applause ]	0
Nice.	0
Tonight, thousands of people here in the Q, along with millions of voters at home will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate, answering the questions you want answered.	0
Less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican party's nomination.	0
[ applause ]	0
Tonight's candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls.	0
Just a few hours ago, you heard from the candidates ranked 11th through 17.	0
And now, the prime-time event, the top 10.	0
Also of note, Fox News is partnering for tonight's debate with Facebook.	0
For the past several weeks, we've been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook.	0
Nearly 6 million of you, 6 million, viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions: some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight.	0
As for the candidates who will be answering those questions?	0
Here they are.	0
Positioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls, in the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump.	0
[ applause ]	0
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.	0
[ applause ]	0
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.	0
[ applause ]	0
Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.	0
[ applause ]	0
Neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson.	0
[ applause ]	0
Texas Senator Ted Cruz.	0
[ applause ]	0
Florida Senator Marco Rubio.	0
[ applause ]	0
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.	0
[ applause ]	0
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.	0
[	0
applause ] And your very own governor of Ohio...	0
[ applause ]	0
... John Kasich.	0
[ applause ]	0
Brett -- Brett, I think you would call that a home field advantage.	0
It might be.	0
It might be.	0
We'll see.	0
Is this in the rules?	0
An objection's coming.	0
It might be.	0
The rules for tonight are simple.	0
One minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups.	0
And if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this.	0
Pleasant, no?	0
We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned.	0
And while we expect them...	0
[ applause ]	0
... we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidate.	0
So, we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Somewhere there, we'll find a balance tonight.	0
Without further ado, let's begin.	0
Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions.	0
So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one.	0
Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person.	0
Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now -- raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight.	0
Mr. Trump.	0
[ booing ]	0
Mr. Trump to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary debate stage.	0
I fully understand.	0
The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.	0
I fully understand.	0
And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton.	0
You can't say tonight that you can make that pledge?	0
I cannot say.	0
I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do.	0
I can totally make that pledge.	0
If I'm the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent.	0
But -- and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.	0
We want to win, and we will win.	0
But I want to win as the Republican.	0
I want to run as the Republican nominee.	0
So tonight, you can't say if another one of these...	0
This is what's wrong!	0
OK.	0
I mean, this is what's wrong.	0
He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, he's already...	0
Dr. Paul.	0
Hey, look, look!	0
He's already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK?	0
So if he doesn't run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent...	0
OK.	0
...but I'd say that he's already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politicians.	0
Well, I've given him plenty of money.	0
Just to be clear, you can't make a -- we're gonna -- we're going to move on.	0
You're not gonna make the pledge tonight?	0
I will not make the pledge at this time.	0
OK. Alright.	0
[ laughter and boing ]	0
Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson.	0
You are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn.	0
Your critics say that your inexperience shows.	0
You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.	0
Aren't these basic mistakes, and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president?	0
Well, I could take issue with -- with all of those things, but we don't have time.	0
But I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly.	0
So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that's what will get us on the right track now, as well.	0
"Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this: ""There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd."""	0
Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.	0
Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight.	0
Let me begin by saying this: I'm not new to the political process; I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate.	0
I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition.	0
It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's gonna be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight.	0
Here's what this election better be about: This election better be about the future, not the past.	0
It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.	0
This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed.	0
You know, the largest retailer in the country and the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store?	0
And these changes have been disruptive.	0
They have changed people's lives.	0
The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.	0
If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck?	0
I was raised paycheck to paycheck.	0
How is she -- how is she gonna lecture me -- how is she gonna lecture me about student loans?	0
I owed over $100,000 just four years ago.	0
If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush, you have insisted that you're your own man.	0
You say you have a life experience uniquely your own.	0
Not your father's, not your brother's.	0
"But there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, ""the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office."""	0
So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?	0
Absolutely, I do, and I'm gonna run hard, run with heart, and run to win.	0
I'm gonna have to earn this.	0
Maybe the barrier -- the bar's even higher for me.	0
That's fine.	0
I've got a record in Florida.	0
I'm proud of my dad, and I'm certainly proud of my brother.	0
In Florida, they called me Jeb, because I earned it.	0
I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion.	0
We were -- we had -- we balanced every budget.	0
We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves.	0
We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating.	0
They keep -- they called me Veto Corleone.	0
Because I vetoed 2,500 separate line-items in the budget.	0
[ applause ]	0
I am my own man.	0
I governed as a conservative, and I govern effectively.	0
And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created.	0
We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter.	0
However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women.	0
"You've called women you don't like ""fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals."""	0
[ laughter ]	0
Your Twitter account...	0
Only Rosie O'Donnell.	0
[ laughter ]	0
No, it wasn't.	0
[	0
applause ] Your Twitter account...	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.	0
Yes, I'm sure it was.	0
Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks.	0
You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.	0
Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?	0
I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct.	0
[ applause ]	0
I've been challenged by so many people, and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness.	0
And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either.	0
This country is in big trouble.	0
We don't win anymore.	0
We lose to China.	0
We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border.	0
We lose to everybody.	0
And frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it's fun, it's kidding.	0
We have a good time.	0
What I say is what I say.	0
And honestly Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry.	0
I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me.	0
But I wouldn't do that.	0
[ applause ]	0
But you know what, we -- we need strength, we need energy, we need quickness and we need brain in this country to turn it around.	0
That, I can tell you right now.	0
Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party.	0
He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don't reach out to minorities.	0
You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress.	0
You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently.	0
[ applause ]	0
How can you win in 2016 when you're such a divisive figure?	0
Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth.	0
[ applause ]	0
If you're looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get -- to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain't your guy.	0
There is a reason...	0
[ applause ]	0
.... that we have $18 trillion in debt.	0
Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections.	0
We got a Republican House, we've got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments.	0
I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Christie, you're not exactly the darling of conservatives.	0
You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state.	0
On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy.	0
This -- this may be why.	0
Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades.	0
The state's 44th in private sector growth.	0
You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country.	0
So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different?	0
If you think it's bad now, you should've seen it when I got there.	0
[ laught and applause ]	0
The fact is -- the fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.	0
In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56 percent.	0
And in the eight years before I become governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times.	0
In the eight years before I became Governor, spending was increased 56 percent, and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey.	0
Zero.	0
For eight years.	0
So, what did we do?	0
We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget.	0
We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases.	0
In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor.	0
We cut business taxes $2.3 billion, and we cut regulation by one-third of what my predecessor put in place.	0
And, what's happened since?	0
A hundred ninety-two thousand private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor.	0
We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud we've brought our state back.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Walker, you've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.	0
You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you're on the record as having objected to it.	0
Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?	0
Well, I'm pro-life, I've always been pro-life, and I've got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that...	0
[ applause ]	0
...in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there, and I've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother.	0
That's been consistently proven.	0
Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out...	0
[ applause ]	0
...I've got a position that's in line with everyday America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues.	0
You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage.	0
You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother.	0
Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don't, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016?	0
Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment.	0
That's a long and difficult process.	0
I've actually taken the position that's bolder than that.	0
A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if that's a huge game changer.	0
I think it's time to do something even more bold.	0
I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception.	0
The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on.	0
And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law.	0
It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like they're parts to a Buick.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks.	0
You later said that that statement, you could have said it better.	0
"But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, ""Everything they've talked about in foreign policy, they've been wrong for the last 20 years."""	0
Why are you so quick to blame your own party?	0
First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism.	0
Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity.	0
But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS?	0
I've got a proposal.	0
I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS.	0
[ applause ]	0
I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS.	0
ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees.	0
It's a disgrace.	0
We've got to stop -- we shouldn't fund our enemies, for goodness sakes.	0
So, we didn't create ISIS -- ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.	0
You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor.	0
Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won't use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?	0
Well, first of all...	0
[ applause ]	0
...	0
first of all, Megyn, you should know that -- that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times.	0
Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what?	0
To treat the mentally ill.	0
Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons.	0
It costs $22,500 a year...	0
[ applause ]	0
...	0
to keep them in prison.	0
I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life.	0
Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted.	0
Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems.	0
We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is -- is threatening their very families.	0
So we're treating them and getting them on their feet.	0
And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet.	0
And do you know what?	0
Everybody has a right to their God-given purpose.	0
And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country.	0
And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black.	0
We've cut $5 billion in taxes...	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
...and we've grown 350,000 jobs.	0
[ applause ]	0
Gentlemen, we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration.	0
Governor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue.	0
I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants.	0
And here's what you said.	0
They broke the law, but it's not a felony, it's an act of love.	0
It's an act of commitment to your family.	0
Do you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?	0
I do.	0
I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option.	0
They want to provide for their family.	0
But we need to control our border.	0
It's not -- it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in.	0
So I -- I've written a book about this and yet this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that -- that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E-Verify, we need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay.	0
We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security.	0
We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country.	0
It is ridiculous and tragic...	0
[ applause ]	0
...that people are dying because of the fact that -- that local governments are not following the federal law.	0
There's much to do.	0
And I think rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama has done now for six long years, the next president -- and I hope to be that president -- will fix this once and for all so that we can turn this into a driver for high sustained economic growth.	0
And there should be a path to earned legal status...	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
...	0
for those that are here.	0
Not -- not amnesty, earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals -- rapists, drug dealers, across the border.	0
"Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, ""extraordinarily ugly."""	0
I'd like you -- you're right next to him -- tell us -- talk to him directly and say how you respond to that and -- and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but you have evidence you have refused or declined to share.	0
Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?	0
So, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris.	0
You wouldn't even be talking about it.	0
[ applause ]	0
This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement.	0
And I said, Mexico is sending.	0
Except the reporters, because they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn't cover my statement the way I said it.	0
The fact is, since then, many killings ,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in.	0
And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly.	0
And I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally.	0
But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds -- I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border?	0
Thirty seconds.	0
Border Patrol, I was at the border last week.	0
Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening.	0
Because our leaders are stupid.	0
Our politicians are stupid.	0
And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning.	0
And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them.	0
They don't want to take care of them.	0
Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them?	0
And that's what is happening whether you like it or not.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
All right.	0
Obviously there's a lot more to talk about this.	0
We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook.	0
[ video clip begins ]	0
What will be your plan on making immigration easier for those that want to do it legally?	0
What specific steps would you take to contain the growth of ISIS?	0
I'd like to know what the candidates are going to do so that I feel safe in my own country again.	0
[ video clip ends ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night.	0
We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration.	0
We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there.	0
So let's continue the conversation.	0
Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump.	0
But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said.	0
When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?	0
Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're really going to learn it.	0
Here is the thing about Donald Trump.	0
Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country.	0
He is.	0
He's hitting a nerve.	0
People are frustrated.	0
They're fed up.	0
They don't think the government is working for them.	0
And for people who want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake.	0
Now, he's got his solutions.	0
Some of us have other solutions.	0
You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington.	0
Hasn't been done since.	0
I was a military reformer.	0
I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.	0
Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration?	0
But the point is that we all have solutions.	0
Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built.	0
They want to see an end to illegal immigration.	0
They want to see it, and we all do.	0
But we all have different ways of getting there.	0
And you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.	0
All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you.	0
Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?	0
Let me set the record straight on a couple of things.	0
The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico.	0
They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.	0
Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.	0
I also believe we need a fence.	0
The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too.	0
And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration.	0
But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said.	0
People are frustrated.	0
This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration.	0
There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of.	0
We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.	0
And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates.	0
The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States.	0
And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in.	0
And they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally.	0
[ applause ]	0
And so these are important issues, and we should address it.	0
It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.	0
Governor Walker.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.	0
Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about, and that you've changed your mind.	0
Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?	0
Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I acknowledged that.	0
I said I actually listened to the American people.	0
And I think people across America want a leader who's actually going to listen to them.	0
I talked to border state governors and other elected officials.	0
I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country.	0
Most importantly, I listened to the people of America.	0
I believe we need to secure the border.	0
I've been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there.	0
There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it.	0
Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, some 1,400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal.	0
"Doug Bettencourt sent this question, ""will you support Kate Steinle's Law,"" which would impose a mandatory five-year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country?"	0
And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law?	0
Chris, absolutely yes.	0
And not only will I support it...	0
[ applause ]	0
...I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation.	0
I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law.	0
You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid.	0
It's not a question of stupidity.	0
It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws.	0
That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.	0
President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country.	0
There's 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country.	0
If they come legally, great.	0
But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking.	0
A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty.	0
I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.	0
Alright, gentlemen, we're gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.	0
Governor Christie.	0
You've said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA's collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack.	0
Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?	0
Yes, I do.	0
And I'll tell you why: because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who has gone before the federal -- the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after September 11th.	0
I was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush on September 10th, 2001, and the world changed enormously the next day, and that happened in my state.	0
This is not theoretical to me.	0
I went to the funerals.	0
We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day.	0
My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning.	0
When you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it, for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland.	0
And I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people.	0
We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way.	0
As president, that is exactly what I'll do.	0
Megyn, may I respond?	0
[ applause ]	0
May I respond?	0
Go ahead, sir.	0
I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans.	0
The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over!	0
John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.	0
[ applause ]	0
And -- and, Megyn?	0
Megyn, that's a -- that, you know, that's a completely ridiculous answer.	0
I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people.	0
How are you supposed to know, Megyn?	0
Use the Fourth Amendment!	0
What are you supposed to...	0
Use the Fourth Amendment!	0
...how are you supposed to -- no, I'll tell you how you, look...	0
Get a warrant!	0
Let me tell you something, you go...	0
Get a judge to sign the warrant!	0
When you -- you know, senator...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Governor Christie, make your point.	0
Listen, senator, you know, when you're sitting in a subcommittee, just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that.	0
[ applause ]	0
When you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure...	0
See, here's the problem.	0
...is to make sure that you use the system the way it's supposed to work.	0
Here's the problem, governor.	0
Here's the problem, governor.	0
You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights.	0
Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge.	0
I'm talking about searches without warrants...	0
There is no...	0
...indiscriminately, of all Americans' records, and that's what I fought to end.	0
I don't trust President Obama with our records.	0
I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.	0
[ applause ]	0
Go ahead, governor.	0
And you know -- you know, Senator Paul?	0
Senator Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11th.	0
Those are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do -- and those had nothing to do with politics, unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate, then putting them on the Internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign...	0
Alright.	0
...and while still putting our country at risk.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Alright, we've gotta cut it off there.	0
We have plenty more we want to get to.	0
That was an interesting exchange, thank you for that.	0
You know what, Megyn, can I...	0
Well, I want to move on, because I have -- we're gonna get to you, governor, but I -- I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner.	0
His name is Alex Chalgren, and he has the following question:	0
[ video clip begins ]	0
: My question is, how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS -- ISIL and its growing influence in the U.S., if they were to become president?	0
[ video clip ends ]	0
Senator Cruz, I wanna talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and -- and -- the -- the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight.	0
"You asked the chairman of the joint chiefs a question: ""What would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days?"""	0
"He told you ""IISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide."""	0
And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis.	0
How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?	0
Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth.	0
"We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, ""radical Islamic terrorism""."	0
[ applause ]	0
When I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution.	0
We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization.	0
That, with all due respect, is nonsense.	0
It's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs.	0
What we need is a commander in chief who makes -- clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.	0
You don't see it as...	0
[ applause ]	0
...an ideological problem -- an ideological problem in addition to a military one?	0
[ applause ]	0
Megyn, of course it's an ideological problem, that's one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans.	0
[ applause ]	0
Yes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist.	0
"He said, ""Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions--"""	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President al-Sisi did, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush, for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now...	0
...I remember...	0
...we would've invaded Iraq...	0
...I remember, Megyn.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there.	0
"You finally said, ""No."""	0
To the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake?	0
Knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when -- when we invaded, it was a mistake.	0
I wouldn't have gone in, however, for the people that did lose their lives, and the families that suffer because of it -- I know this full well because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them.	0
Every one of them that I could find to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them, and it was really hard to do.	0
And, every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife, of their husband did not die in vain.	0
So, why it was difficult for me to do it was based on that.	0
Here's the lesson that we should take from this, which relates to this whole subject.	0
Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq.	0
He left, and when he left Al Qaida was done for.	0
ISIS was created because	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana.	0
To honor the people that died, we need to -- we need to --- stop the -- Iran agreement, for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world.	0
Which Arab country not already in the U.S. led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner?	0
I don't know about additional ones.	0
We need to focus on the ones we have.	0
You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we've had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important.	0
You look at the Saudis -- in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them what's the greatest challenge in the world today?	0
Set aside the Iran deal.	0
They said it's the disengagement of America.	0
We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine -- America's a great country.	0
We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.	0
Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror.	0
As president, would you bring back water boarding?	0
Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have a lot for you, don't worry.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
Fear not, you may rue that request.	0
Alright.	0
You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting what we're going to do.	0
[ applause ]	0
We. .	0
.uh. .	0
.we've gotten into this -- this mindset of fighting politically correct wars.	0
There is no such thing as a politically correct war.	0
[ applause ]	0
And, the left, of course, will say Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention.	0
Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars.	0
And -- and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars.	0
And I've talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people.	0
And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out.	0
And if we don't tie their hands behind their back, they will do it...	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
...extremely effectively.	0
[ applause ]	0
Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government.	0
Mr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster.	0
A complete disaster, yes.	0
Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced.	0
Correct.	0
Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care.	0
You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system.	1
Why were you for that then and why aren't you for it now?	0
First of all, I'd like to just go back to one.	0
In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East.	0
And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it.	0
And that's exactly what happened.	0
But on ObamaCare...	0
And the Middle East became totally destabilized.	0
So I just want to say.	0
As far as single payer, it works in Canada.	0
It works incredibly well in Scotland.	0
It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here.	0
What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state.	0
I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees.	0
And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder.	0
Nobody can bid.	0
You know why?	0
Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage.	0
But they have total control of the politicians.	0
They're making a fortune.	0
Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have...	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
...yourself great plans.	0
And then we have to take care of the people that can't take care of themselves.	0
And I will do that through a different system.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Mr. Trump, hold up one second.	0
I've got a news flash...	0
All right, now, hold on, Senator Paul...	0
News flash, the Republican Party's been fighting against a single-payer system...	0
OK.	0
-- for a decade.	0
So I think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single-payer system.	0
I'm not -- I'm not are -- I don't think you heard me.	0
You're having a hard time tonight.	0
All right, let me...	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, it's not just your past support for single- payer health care.	0
You've also supported a host of other liberal policies.	0
Use -- you've also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi.	0
You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors.	0
"And you said recently, quote, ""When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do."""	0
You'd better believe it.	0
So what specifically did...	0
That's true.	0
-- they do?	0
If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.	0
Not me.	0
Not me.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But you're welcome to give me a check, Donald if you'd like.	0
Many of them.	0
Actually, to be clear...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...he supported Charlie Crist.	0
Not much.	0
Hey, Charlie...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
But I...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Donald, if you...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I have good...	0
-- this campaign, I hope you will give to me.	0
Good.	0
OK.	0
Sounds good.	0
Sounds good to me, Governor.	0
I will tell you that our system is broken.	0
I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman.	0
I give to everybody.	0
When they call, I give.	0
And do you know what?	0
When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.	0
So what did you get?	0
And that's a broken system.	0
What did you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi?	0
Well, I'll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding.	0
You know why?	0
She didn't have a choice because I gave.	0
I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good.	0
I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world.	0
It was.	0
But...[	0

We're going to -- we're going to move on.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
We'll come back to you, Governor Walker.	0
Just one second on this, though.	0
We -- we spent a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and ---and pitting us back and forth.	0
Let's be clear, we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject, because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she and the president	0
[ inaudible ]	0

We have many questions to come.	0
It's true.	0
Many questions to come.	0
[ applause ]	0
"Governor Huckabee, on Facebook, John Pietricone asked this, ""Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education?"""	0
Now, broadly...	0
[ applause ]	0
...broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives.	0
But year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government.	0
But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn't happen.	0
In fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians.	0
So the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?	0
It's not too big to shrink.	0
But the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington axis of power that has controlled the political climate.	0
The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants.	0
And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger.	0
Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party.	0
Wasn't even the legislature.	0
It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for.	0
And the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution.	0
This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it's the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
And I'm still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the FairTax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people's income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.	0
Dr. Carson...	0
Bret, Bret, Bret...	0
Dr. Carson, do you agree with that?	0
What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system.	0
And the one that I've advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy.	0
And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn't matter how much you made.	0
If you've had a bumper crop, you don't owe me triple tithes.	0
And if you've had no crops at all, you don't owe me no tithes.	0
So there must be something inherently fair about that.	0
And that's why I've advocated a proportional tax system.	0
You make $10 billion, you pay a billion.	0
You make $10, you pay one.	0
And everybody gets treated the same way.	0
And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes, and...	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
Governor Bush?	0
And I have a lot more to say about it.	0
We're going to come back to you, Dr. Carson.	0
Governor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math.	0
A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose a federal involvement in education.	0
They say it should all be handled locally.	0
"President Obama's secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, ""fringe group of critics."""	0
Do you think that's accurate?	0
No, I don't.	0
And I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content.	0
It is clearly a state responsibility.	0
I'm for higher standards...	0
[ applause ]	0
...measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion.	0
And I know how to do this because as governor of the state of Florida I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program, in the country and the third statewide voucher program in the country.	0
And we had rising student achievement across the board, because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go.	0
And Florida's low income kids had the greatest gains inside the country.	0
Our graduation rate improved by 50 percent.	0
That's what I'm for.	0
Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?	0
Well, first off, I too believe in curriculum reform.	0
It is critically important in the 21st Century.	0
We do need curriculum reform.	0
And it should happen at the state and local level.	0
That's. . .	0
that's. . .	0
that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature, or their governor and get it changed.	0
Here's the problem with Common Core.	0
The Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied.	0
They will not stop with it being a suggestion.	0
They will turn it into a mandate.	0
In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is, you will not get federal money unless do you things the way we want you to do it.	0
And they will use Common Core or any other requirements that exists nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.	0
[ applause ]	0
And do you agree with your old friend?	0
He is definitely my friend.	0
And I think the states ought to create these standards.	0
And if states want to opt out of Common Core, fine.	0
Just make sure your standards are high.	0
Because today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world other than a couple rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30 percent are college- and/or career-ready.	1
If we are going to compete in this world we're in today, there is no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything.	0
Children are going to suffer and families' hearts are going to be broken that their kids won't be able to get a job in the 21st Century.	0

It's just before 10:00 p.m. on the East Coast.	0
Welcome back to Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and the very first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential campaign.	0
Ten candidates on the stage, selected based on their standing in five national polls.	0
And tonight they are facing off, answering the questions you want asked.	0
We hope.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Gentlemen, we're obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we're also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects.	0
This is the first of the many rounds, and it's about somebody whose name probably hasn't been mentioned enough so far tonight.	0
Governor Kasich, let me start with you.	0
Whoever the Republican nominee --	0
[ applause ]	0
Whoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton.	0
You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is.	0
She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class.	0
That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities.	0
She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past.	0
How will you, if you're the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?	0
Let's start off with my father being a mailman.	0
So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom have trouble, you know, making ends meet.	0
But I think she will come in a narrow way.	0
The nominee of this party, if they're going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth.	0
Which is balancing budgets.	0
You know, we were talking about it.	0
People were saying, could we do it?	0
I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus.	0
Economic growth is the key.	0
Economic growth is the key to everything.	0
But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who don't seem to ever think that they get a fair deal.	0
And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they don't have a chance to move up.	0
You know, America is a miracle country.	0
"And we have to restore the sense that the ""Amiracle"" will apply to you."	0
Each and every one of the people in this country who's watching tonight, lift everybody,	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again.	0
It will be and can be done.	0
I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we're only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson.	0
Basically, same question to you.	0
If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq?	0
If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive -- the secular progressive movement.	0
And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots.	0
Well, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid.	0
[ applause ]	0
And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems.	0
You know, you look at the -- the national debt and how it's being driven up.	0
If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person.	0
And that's what she's doing.	0
[ applause ]	0
Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government.	0
And Governor Bush, I'm going to start with you.	0
You have made a bold promise in your announcement.	0
You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president.	0
That many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together.	0
And four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War.	0
So question, how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?	0
We've done it 27 times since World War II.	0
I think we need to lift our spirits and have high, lofty expectations for this great country of ours.	0
The new normal of two percent that the left is saying you can't do anything about is so dangerous for our country.	0
There's 6 million people living in poverty today, more than when Barack Obama got elected.	0
6.5 million people are working part-time, most of whom want to work full-time.	0
We've created rules and taxes on top of every aspiration of people, and the net result is we're not growing fast, income's not growing.	0
A four percent growth strategy means you fix a convoluted tax code.	0
You get in and you change every aspect of regulations that are job killers.	0
You get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn't suppress wages and kill jobs.	0
[ applause ]	0
You embrace the energy revolution in our country.	0
This president and Hillary Clinton, who can't even say she's for the XL pipeline even after she's left?	0
Give me a break.	0
Of course we're for it.	0
We should be for these things to create high sustained economic growth.	0
And frankly,	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
fixing our immigration system and turning it into an economic driver is part of this as well.	0
We can do this.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Walker.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Walker, when you ran for governor of Wisconsin back in 2010, you promised that you would create 250,000 jobs in your first term, first four years.	0
In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth.	0
Now you're running for president, and you're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream.	0
Given your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?	0
Well, the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high, not aimed low.	0
Before I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent.	0
It's now down to 4.6 percent.	0
We've more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession.	0
And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally.	0
You know, people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington.	0
One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C..	0
I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs.	0
And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in -- reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place an all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code.	0
That's what I'll do as president, just like I did in Wisconsin.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Christie, I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns, and that is entitlement reform.	0
You say that you -- to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age -- have to raise the retirement age, and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare, and you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying.	0
Governor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that.	0
Is he lying?	0
No, he's not lying, he's just wrong.	0
I mean, so, there's a difference -- I'm the only guy on this stage who's put out a detailed, 12 point plan on entitlement reform and here's why -- because 71% of federal spending right now is on entitlements, and debt service, 71%.	0
And we have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29%, and no time on the 71%, and that makes no sense.	0
Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security.	0
Yes, we'd raise the retirement age two years, and phase it in over 25 years, that means we'd raise it one month a year for 25 years when we're all living longer, and living better lives.	0
Secondly, we would means test Social Security for those who are making over $200,000 dollars a year in retirement income, and have $4 to $5 million dollars in liquid assets saved.	0
They don't need that Social Security check.	0
Social Security is meant to be -- to make sure that no one who's worked hard, and played by the rules, and paid into the system grows old in poverty in America.	0
If we don't deal with this problem, it will bankrupt our country, or lead to massive tax increases, neither one that we want in this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Huckabee?	0
You say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a FairTax, which is a broad tax on consumption.	0
Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need?	0
Well, let's all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million.	0
A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security.	0
Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government.	0
The government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not.	0
And, if person goes to 65, they're going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck.	0
Now, here's the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up?	0
Is it the recipients, or is it the government?	0
And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.	0
It's always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think it's fundamentally lying to the people and stealing from them, and we shouldn't be doing it.	0
[ applause ]	0
Chris...	0
...Thirty seconds.	0
Yeah, sure.	0
And, I don't disagree with ending Congress' retirement program.	0
I'm a governor, I don't have a retirement program in my state, and I don't disagree with that.	0
But, here's the news to the American people, he's complaining about the lying and stealing.	0
The lying and stealing has already occurred.	0
The trust fund is filled with IOU's.	0
"We can't fix the problem just by ending Congress's retirement, that's worth about, ""this"" much."	0
We need to go at the fundamental problem, and the fundamental problem is that this system is broken.	0
It has been stolen from.	0
We have been lied to,	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
and we need a strong leader to tell the truth and fix...	0
...Alright, this is it.	0
Thirty Seconds, finally.	0
Well, you ask about how we fund it.	0
One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage.	0
The people who get wages is declining dramatically.	0
Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and -- and capital gains.	0
The FairTax transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
that are freeloading off the system now.	0
[ applause ]	0
That's why it ought to be a transformed system.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Enough.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump.	0
[ off mike ]	0
Sounds like somebody's a little R-rated.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy, I want to ask you about your business records.	0
From corporations, Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century.	0
"...In 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this: ""I've used the laws of the country to my advantage."""	0
But at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars.	0
Question sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation's business?	0
Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera.	0
I have never gone bankrupt, by the way.	0
I have never.	0
But out of hundreds of deals...	0
No, but the concept sir...	0
Excuse me.	0
Excuse me.	0
... that's your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt.	0
Excuse me, what am I saying?	0
Out of hundreds of deals that I've done, hundreds, on four occasions I've taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people.	0
I'm not going to name their names because I'm not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the law.	0
The difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it.	0
"When I use it, they say, ""Trump, Trump, Trump."""	0
The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion.	0
I have a great, great company.	0
I employ thousands of people.	0
And I'm very proud of the job I did.	0
Again Chris, hundreds and hundreds of deals.	0
Four times, I've taken advantage of the laws.	0
And frankly, so has everybody else in my position.	0
Well sir, let's just talk about the latest example...	0
[ applause ]	0
...which is Trump Entertainment Resorts, which went bankrupt in 2009.	0
In that case alone, lenders to your company lost over $1 billion and more than 1,100 people were laid off.	0
Well, I...	0
Is that the way that you'd run the country?	0
Let me just tell you about the lenders.	0
First of all, these lenders aren't babies.	0
These are total killers.	0
These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK?	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
You know, I mean you're living in a world of the make-believe, Chris, you want to know the truth.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt.	0
Every company, Chris can tell you, every company virtually in Atlantic City went bankrupt.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Every company.	0
And let me just tell you.	0
I had the good sense, and I've gotten a lot of credit in the financial pages, seven years ago I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City, and I'm very proud of it.	0
I want to tell you that.	0
Very, very proud of it.	0
So...	0
And by the way, this country right now owes $19 trillion.	0
And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio.	0
Senator Rubio, more than 3,000 people sent us questions about the economy and jobs on Facebook.	0
And here is a video question from Tania Cioloko from Philadelphia.	0
Here she is.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
Please describe one action you would do to make the economic environment more favorable for small businesses and entrepreneurs and anyone dreaming of opening their own business.	0
[ close video clip ]	0
That's a great question.	0
Senator, how do you answer Tania?	0
That's a great question.	0
First of all, it begins by having leaders that recognize that the economy we live in today is dramatically different from the one we had five years ago.	0
It's an economy that now has placed us in global competition with dozens of other countries around the world.	0
Now, the big companies that have connections with Washington, they can affect policies to help them, but the small companies like the one Tania is talking about, they're the ones that are struggling.	0
The first thing we need to do is we need to even out the tax code for small businesses so that we lower their tax rate to 25 percent, just as we need to lower it for all businesses.	0
We need to have a regulatory budget in America that limits the amount of regulations on our economy.	0
We need to repeal and replace Obamacare and we need to improve higher education so that people can have access to the skills they need for 21st century jobs.	0
And last but not least, we need to repeal Dodd-Frank.	0
It is eviscerating small businesses and small banks.	0
[ applause ]	0
20 — over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out over the — since Dodd-Frank has passed.	0
We need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank.	0
We need to make America fair again for all businesses, but especially those being run by small business owners.	0
Senator Rubio, thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Gentlemen, another question for a few of you.	0
"Yesterday, just yesterday, President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal, calling them knee-jerk partisans, adding that hardliners in Iran who chant ""death to America"" were, quote, ""making common cause with the Republican caucus."""	0
Here's what two of your opponents on the 5 p.m. debate stage said about Iran.	0
[ video clip begins ]	0
I will tell you one thing: I would whole lot rather had Carly Fiorina over there doing our negotiation than John Kerry.	0
Maybe we would've gotten a deal where we didn't give everything away.	0
But the issue for us is to have a Congress that stands up and says not only no, but hell no, to this money going to a regime that is going to use it for terror...	0
[ video clip ends ]	0
[ video clip begins ]	0
When America does not lead, the world is a dangerous and a tragic place.	0
This is a bad deal.	0
Obama broke every rule of negotiation.	0
Yes, our allies are not perfect, but Iran is at the heart of most of the evil that is going on in the Middle East through their proxy.	0
[ video clip ends ]	0
Now, I wanna ask a few of you this.	0
First, Governor Walker.	0
You've said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one.	0
If this deal is undone, what then?	0
Well, first off, let's remember.	0
I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage.	0
Iran is not a place we should be doing business with.	0
To me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same.	0
This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS.	0
It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader who's gonna stand up and do something about it.	0
It's yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one?	0
I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it.	0
I don't think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I don't immediately discount negotiations.	0
I'm a Reagan conservative.	0
Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets.	0
But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early.	0
If there's going to be a negotiation, you're going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply.	0
"And I asked this question to John Kerry, I said ""do you believe they're trustworthy?"""	0
"and he said ""No."""	0
"And I said, ""well, how are we gonna get them to comply?"""	0
I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.	0
Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said?	0
"Ronald Reagan said ""trust, but verify."""	0
"President Obama is ""trust, but vilify."""	0
He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him.	0
And the reason we disagree with him has nothing to do with party.	0

It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gonna be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing.	0
We didn't even get four hostages out.	0
We got nothing, and Iran gets everything they want.	0
We said we would have anywhere, anytime negotiations and inspections, we gave that up.	0
We said that we would make sure that they didn't have any nuclear capacity, we gave that up.	0
The president can't tell us what we got.	0
I'll tell you what the world got.	0
"The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didn't, as the Soviets, say ""we might defend ourselves in a war."""	0
"What the Iranians have said is, ""we will wipe Israel off the face of the map, and we will bring death to America."""	0
When someone points a gun at your head	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously, and we need to take that seriously.	0
Thank you, gentlemen.	0
Well, the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign continues from Cleveland after a short time-out.	0
Stick around.	0
Social issues, next.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Senator Rubio, you favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans.	0
Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous.	0
He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings.	0
If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?	0
Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record.	0
I would go on to add that I believe all--	0
You don't favor a rape and incest exception?	0
I have never said that.	0
And I have never advocated that.	0
What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.	0
In fact, I think that law already exists.	0
It is called the Constitution of the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
And let me go further.	0
I believe that every single human being is entitled to the protection of our laws, whether they can vote or not.	0
Whether they can speak or not.	0
Whether they can hire a lawyer or not.	0
Whether they have a birth certificate or not.	0
And I think future generations will look back at this history of our country and call us barbarians for murdering millions of babies who we never gave them a chance to live.	0
[ applause ]	0
"Mr. Trump, in 1999, you said you were, quote, ""very pro- choice."""	0
Even supporting partial-birth abortion.	0
You favored an assault weapons ban as well.	0
In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat.	0
Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on the stage things like clowns and puppets.	0
When did you actually become a Republican?	0
[ catcalls ]	0
I don't think they like me very much.	0
I'll tell you what.	0
I've evolved on many issues over the years.	0
And you know who else has?	0
Is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues.	0
And I am pro-life.	0
And if you look at the question, I was in business.	0
They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice.	0
And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion.	0
I hate the concept of abortion.	0
And then since then, I've very much evolved.	0
And what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted.	0
And it wasn't aborted.	0
And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child.	0
And I saw that.	0
And I saw other instances.	0
And I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.	0
As far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place, New York City, which is virtually, I mean, it is almost exclusively Democrat.	0
And I have really started to see some of the negatives -- as an example, and I have a lot of liking for this man, but the last number of months of	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
his brother's administration were a catastrophe.	0
And unfortunately, those few months gave us President Obama.	0
And you can't be happy about that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush, I want to ask you, on the subject of name calling of your fellow candidates, a story appeared today quoting an anonymous GOP donor who said you called Mr. Trump a clown, a buffoon, something else that cannot be repeated on television.	0
None of which is true.	0
Is it true?	0
No.	0
It's not true.	0
But I have said that Mr. Trump's language is divisive.	0
I want to win.	0
I want one of these people here or the ones at 5:00, to be the next president of the United States.	0
We're not going on win by doing what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do each and every day.	0
Dividing the country.	0
Saying, creating a grievance kind of environment.	0
We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message.	0
I have that message because I was a governor of a state that saw people lifted up, because we had high sustained economic growth.	0
Our economy grew at double the rate of the nation.	0
We created 1.3 million jobs.	0
We led the nation seven out of those eight years.	0
We were only one of two states that went to AAA bond rating.	0
I cut taxes, $19 billion.	0
If you do that and apply conservative principles the right way, you create an environment where everybody rises up.	0
That's how we're going to win.	0
Campaigning in places to give people hope that their life is better because too many people are suffering today in America.	0
Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.	0
First of all, Jeb, I am very happy that you denied that, and I appreciate that very much.	0
He is a true gentleman.	0
He really is.	0
One thing he did say, and I mean that.	0
The one thing he did say about me, however, was my tone.	0
And I also understand that.	0
But when you have people that are cutting Christians' heads off, when you have a world that the border and at so many places, that it is medieval times, we've never -- it almost has to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror, we don't have time for tone.	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
We have to go out and get the job done.	0
[ applause ]	0
The subject of gay marriage and religious liberty.	0
Governor Kasich, if you had a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-sex marriage?	0
Well, look, I'm an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage.	0
But I've also said the court has ruled --	0
How would you -- how would you explain it to a child?	0
Wait, Megyn, the court has ruled, and I said we'll accept it.	0
And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay.	0
Because somebody doesn't think the way I do, doesn't mean that I can't care about them or can't love them.	0
So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them.	0
Because you know what?	0
[ applause ]	0
That's what we're taught when we have strong faith.	0
[ applause ]	0
So the issues like that, issues like that are planted to divide us.	0
I think the simple fact of the matter is, and this is where I would agree with Jeb, and I've been saying it all along, we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan.	0
So, look, I'm going to love my daughters, I'm going to love them no matter what they do.	0
Because, you know what,	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
God gives me unconditional love.	0
I'm going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.	0
Senator Paul, in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling on same sex marriage, Carol Fox on Facebook want to know the following.	0
Quote: what will you do to ensure Christians are not prosecuted for speaking out against gay marriage and will Christians be forced to conduct business that conflicts with their religious beliefs?	0
Look, I don't want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington.	0
And if people have an opinion, it's a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them.	0
One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers.	0
When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that's when it's time to resist.	0
Governor Walker, many in the Black Lives Matter movement, and beyond, believe that overly-aggressive police officers targeting young African Americans is the civil rights issue of our time.	0
Do you agree?	0
And if so, how do you plan to address it?	0
And if not, why not?	0
Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing -- it's something you've had a guest on who's a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, who's talked to me about this many times in the past -- it's about training.	0
It's about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force.	0
And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement.	0
And for the very few that don't, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.	0
Thank you.	0
Coming up more of our debate, including questions about President Obama's foreign policy and these guys and their better ideas.	0
Coming up.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to Cleveland.	0
Our next topic is foreign policy.	0
Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.	0
His name is General Qassem Soleimani, he's blamed for hundreds of U.S. troop's deaths in Iraq, and Afghanistan.	0
His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran.	0
So, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?	0
I would be so different from what you have right now.	0
Like, the polar opposite.	0
We have a president who doesn't have a clue.	0
I would say he's incompetent, but I don't want to do that because that's not nice.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But if you look at the deals we make, whether it's the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods -- and by the way, before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system.	0
You look at Sgt.	0
Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get five of the big, great killers leaders that they want.	0
We have people in Washington that don't know what they're doing.	0
Now...	0
[ applause; scream from audience ]	0
I agree.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, with Iran, we're making a deal, you would say, we want him.	0
We want out our prisoners.	0
We want all these things, and we don't get anything.	0
We're giving them $150 billion dollars plus, they are going to be -- I'll tell you what, if Iran was a stock, you folks should go out and buy it right now because you'll quadruple -- this, what's happening	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
in Iran, is a disgrace, and it's going to lead to destruction in large portions of the world.	0
[ applause ]	0
Another new development today, Senior Defense officials tell Fox they strongly suspect Russia was behind the cyber attack on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs office...	0
...Please.	0
...email.	0
This comes in the wake of the Director of National Intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans.	0
Senator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed acts of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?	0
Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years we've seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy.	0
Leading from behind is a disaster.	0
We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger.	0
Radical Islam is on the rise, Iran's on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia -- General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces.	0
He's directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani.	0
The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the Joint Chiefs.	0
We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility...	0
[ applause ]	0
It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.	0
[ applause ]	0
"Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, ""that's a redline for us,"" and that there would be enormous consequences."	0
One year later, with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime.	0
As president, would you have used military force there?	0
Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies.	0
Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940.	0
In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel.	0
Our generals are retiring because they don't want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing.	0
Our -- our friends can't trust us anymore.	0
You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state.	0
They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them.	0
We won't even give them offensive weapons.	0
You know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally.	0
You know, in a situation like that, of course Obama's not going to be able to do anything.	0
I would shore up our military first, because if you don't get the military right, nothing else is going to work.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?	0
Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, it's sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton's e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
And -- and that has put our national security at risk.	0
If I am president, he won't think about that.	0
You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets.	0
When you find mush, you push.	0
When you find steel, you stop.	0
Under Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years.	0
We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies.	0
I would send weapons to Ukraine.	0
I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic.	0
[ applause ]	0
We find steel.	0
Governor -- Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing.	0
Women are moving into combat roles.	0
Don't Ask, Don't Tell has obviously been dropped.	0
And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.	0
As commander in chief, how would you handle that?	0
The military is not a social experiment.	0
The purpose of the military is kill people and break things.	0
[ applause ]	0
It's not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse.	0
The purpose is to protect America.	0
I'm not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer.	0
We've reduced the military by 25 percent...	0
[ applause ]	0
... under President Obama.	0
The disaster is that we've forgotten why we have a military.	0
The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether it's in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it.	0
We've not done that because we've decimated our military.	0
We're flying B-52s.	0
The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962.	0
A lot of the B-52s we're flying, we've only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me.	0
And that's pretty scary.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
Senator Paul, the first budget you proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel.	0
You have since changed your view on that issue.	0
What made you change your mind.	0
Well, let's be clear, I'm the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances.	0
I've put pencil to paper...	0
I do.	0
... and I've said -- and I've said I would cut spending, and I've said exactly where.	0
Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us.	0
[ applause ]	0
I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag.	0
Israel is not one of those.	0
But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when they're independent.	0
My position is exactly the same.	0
We shouldn't borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why don't we start with eliminating aid to our enemies.	0
OK.	0
But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?	0
I still say exactly what my original opinion is.	0
Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone?	0
Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally.	0
And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we don't have.	0
We do not project power from bankruptcy court.	0
We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.	0
[ applause ]	0
It's got to stop somewhere.	0
Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer?	0
Well, listen.	0
You know, if we want to deal with these issues, we have to deal with them in a way that makes sense.	0
I agree with what Dr. Carson said earlier.	0
The first thing we need to do to make America stronger is to strengthen our military, and I put out a really specific plan: no less than 500,000 active duty soldiers in the Army.	0
No less than 185,000 active duty marines in the Marine Corps.	0
Bring us to a 350 ship Navy again, and modernize the Ohio class of submarines, and bring our Air Force back to 2,600 aircraft that are ready to go.	0
Those are the kind of things that are going to send a clear message around the world.	0
Those are the things that we need to start working on immediately to make our country stronger and make it better.	0
Those are the things that we need to be able to be doing.	0
And as we move towards dealing with foreign aid, I don't disagree with Senator Paul's position that we shouldn't be funding our enemies.	0
But I absolutely believe that Israel is a priority to be able to fund and keep them strong and safe after eight years of this administration.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor, thank you.	0
Brett, can I -- Brett, can I jump in on this one?	0
Senator, we're going to finish up with some more questions, thank you.	0
We have to stand you by, because after the break, we're going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and . . .	0
God.	0
Stay tuned for that.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back.	0
In our final moments here together, we're going to allow the candidates to offer their final thoughts.	0
"But first, we want to ask them an interesting closing question from Chase Norton on Facebook, who wants to know this of the candidates: ""I want to know if any of them have received a word from God on what they should do and take care of first."""	0
Senator Cruz, start from you.	0
Any word from God?	0
Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures.	0
And God speaks through the Bible.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'm the son of a pastor and evangelist and I've described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic.	0
He wasn't a Christian.	0
And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old.	0
And someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church.	0
And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around.	0
And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me.	0
[ applause ]	0
"I would also note that the scripture tells us, ""you shall know them by their fruit."""	0
"We see lots of ""campaign conservatives."""	0
But if we're going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative.	0
There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage.	0
And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career.	0
And I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, same question.	0
Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman.	0
His father was a coal miner.	0
My mother's mother could barely speak English.	0
And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
I do believe in miracles.	0
You know, I've had a lot of elections.	0
But my elections are really not about campaigns.	0
I tell my people that these are about a movement.	0
And a movement to do what?	0
To restore common sense.	0
A movement to do things like provide economic growth.	0
And a movement not to let anybody be behind.	0
You know, today the country is divided.	0
You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities.	0
We've got to unite our country again, because we're stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided.	0
And we've got to listen to other people's voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that I've read in my lifetime, the Lord'is not picking us.	0
But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong.	0
He wants America to succeed.	0
And he wants America to lead.	0
And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Governor Walker, same question.	0
Well, thanks, Megyn.	0
I'm certainly an imperfect man.	0
And it's only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I've been redeemed from my sins.	0
So I know that God doesn't call me to do a specific thing, God hasn't given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day.	0
What God calls us to do is follow his will.	0
And ultimately that's what I'm going to try to do.	0
And I hope people've seen it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing.	0
It wasn't just how I took on those political battles.	0
It was ultimately how I acted.	0
Not responding in kind.	0
Not lashing out.	0
But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, I want to ask you the same question.	0
But I do want to mention, a woman just came here to the stage and asked, what about the veterans?	0
I want to hear more about what these candidates are going to do for our nation's veterans.	0
So I put the question to you about God and the veterans, which you may find to be related.	0
Well, first, let me say I think God has blessed us.	0
He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates.	0
The Democrats can't even find one.	0
[	0
laughter ]	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
And I believe God has blessed our country.	0
This country has been extraordinarily blessed.	0
And we have honored that blessing.	0
And that's why God has continued to bless us.	0
And he has blessed us with young men and women willing to risk their lives and sometimes die in uniform for the safety and security of our people.	0
Unfortunately today we have a VA that does not do enough for them.	0
I am proud that last year we helped change the law.	0
We changed the law to give the power to the VA secretary the ability to fire any executive that isn't doing their job.	0
And it is outrageous they've only fired one person to date.	0
When I'm president of the United States, we're going to have a VA that cares more about our veterans than about the bureaucrats who work at the VA.	0
[ cheering and applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role, but also, one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now.	0
And what, if anything, you can do -- you would do as the next president to help heal that divide.	0
Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide.	0
You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people.	0
And this does not need to be done.	0
What we need to think about instead -- you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why don't I talk about race that often.	0
I said it's because I'm a neurosurgeon.	0
And she thought that was a strange response.	0
And you say -- I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, I'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are.	0
The skin doesn't make them who they are.	0
The hair doesn't make them who they are.	0
And it's time for us to move beyond that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Because...	0
[ applause ]	0
...our strength as a nation comes in our unity.	0
We are the United States of America, not the divided states.	0
And those who want to destroy us are trying to divide us, and we shouldn't let them do it.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now each candidate will make a closing statement.	0
You'll all have 30 seconds to make a closing statement for this debate.	0
We'll start with Ohio Governor John Kasich.	0
You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do.	0
I want to tell you what I've done.	0
I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years.	0
I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world.	0
No.	0
2.	0
I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon.	0
We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes.	0
I spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works.	0
And now I'm the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
of dying.	0
And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Christie?	0
Well, thank you, Megyn.	0
Listen, I was born into a middle class family in New Jersey.	0
My dad came home from serving in the Army after having lost his father, worked in the Breyers ice cream plant in Newark, New Jersey.	0
Was the first person to graduate from college.	0
He put himself through college at night.	0
My mom was a secretary.	0
I was appointed United States attorney on September 10, 2001.	0
And I spent the next seven years of my career fighting terrorism and putting terrorists in jail.	0
I'm a conservative, pro-life governor in a state where it is really tough to be both.	0
A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets.	0
We fought	0
[ timer sounds ]	0
the teacher's union.	0
This president has had weak leadership, which has led to bad choices.	0
We have got to stop worrying about being loved and start worrying about being respected.	0
And that's exactly how I'll lead our country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Paul, closing statement.	0
I'm a different kind of Republican.	0
I've introduced a five-year balanced budget.	0
I've introduced the largest tax cut in our history.	0
I stood for ten and a half hours on the Senate floor to defend your right to be left alone.	0
[ applause ]	0
But I've also gone to Chicago.	0
I've gone to Detroit.	0
I've been to Ferguson, I've been to Baltimore, because I want our party to be bigger, better and bolder, and I'm the only one that leads Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama.	0
I'm a different kind of Republican.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Marco Rubio.	0
Thank you.	0
You know, both of my parents were born into poor families on the island of Cuba.	0
They came to America because it was the only place where people like them could have a chance.	0
Here in this country, they never made it big, but the very purpose of their life was to give us the chance to do all the things they never could.	0
My father was a bartender.	0
And the journey from the back of that bar to this stage tonight, to me, that is the essence of the American dream.	0
It is what makes our nation different.	0
And I'm running for president because I want that to still be possible for the people trying to do that now.	0
I run for president because I believe that we can't just save the American dream; we can expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before.	0
And that's why I'm asking for your vote.	0
So we can make America greater than it has ever been.	0
And make of this century a new American century.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Senator Ted Cruz.	0
If I'm elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office.	0
The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama.	0
[ applause ]	0
The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations.	0
[ applause ]	0
The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start (sic) persecuting religious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.	0
[ applause ]	0
I will keep my word.	0
My father fled Cuba, and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it's like to lose it.	0
Dr. Carson, closing statement.	0
Well, I haven't said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that.	0
I'm the only one to separate Siamese twins...	0
[ laughter ]	0
The -- the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mother's womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But I -- but I'm very hopeful that I'm not the only one who's willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day.	0
Every one of us must fight for it, because we're fighting for our children and the next generation.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Mike Huckabee, closing statement.	0
It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who's very high in the polls, that doesn't have a clue about how to govern.	0
A person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead, and, of course, I'm talking about Hillary Clinton.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I think America...	0
Thank you.	0
...is in trouble, but it's not beyond repair.	0
But it's going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country, and who believes that once again we can be one nation, under God.	0
I'll be my best to do that, and thank you for your support.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Scott Walker.	0
Thanks.	0
I'm guy with a wife and two kids, and Harley.	0
"One article called me ""aggressively normal."""	0
I ran for governor because I was worried about my kids' future.	0
Then, I took on the big government union bosses, and we won.	0
They tried to recall me, and we won.	0
They target us again, and we won.	0
We balanced the budget, cut taxes, and turned our state around with big, bold reforms.	0
It wasn't too late for Wisconsin, and it's not too late for America.	0
That's why I ask for your vote.	0
Governor Bush, closing statement, sir.	0
Here's what I believe.	0
I believe we're at the verge of the greatest time to be alive in this world.	0
But Washington is holding us back.	0
How we tax, how we regulate.	0
We're not embracing the energy revolution in our midst, a broken immigration system that has been politicized rather than turning it into an economic driver.	0
We're not protecting and preserving our entitlement system or reforming for the next generation.	0
All these things languish while we have politicians in Washington using these as wedge issues.	0
Here's my commitment to you, because I did it as Florida.	0
We can fix these things.	0
We can grow economically and restore America's leadership in the world, so that everybody has a chance to rise up.	0
I humbly ask for your vote, whenever you're gonna get to vote, whenever the primary is.	0
Thank you all very much.	0
Mr. Trump, closing statement, sir.	0
Our country is in serious trouble.	0
We don't win anymore.	0
We don't beat China in trade.	0
We don't beat Japan, with their millions and millions of cars coming into this country, in trade.	0
We can't beat Mexico, at the border or in trade.	0
We can't do anything right.	0
Our military has to be strengthened.	0
Our vets have to be taken care of.	0
We have to end Obamacare, and we have to make our country great again, and I will do that.	0
Thank you.	0
Gentlemen, thank you.	0
It's over!	0
That's it.	0
Are you relieved?	0
You were nervous before, they -- they don't look relieved.	0
"They look ""get me outta here."""	0
Thank you all very much, and that will do it for the first Republican primary debate night of the 2016 presidential race.	0
Our thanks to the candidates, who will now be joined by their families on stage.	0
Welcome to all of you who are joining us.	0
We’re here with the three remaining Republican candidates.	0
In the audience tonight Republican and some independents, all of whom say they are voting in next week’s Republican primary.	0
Some have already made their decisions on a candidate, others still undecided.	0
They came up with the questions you’ll hear tonight.	0
We reviewed them to make sure the questions don’t overlap.	0
I’m going to ask a few questions as well, but tonight this town hall is a chance for voters to hear at length from the candidates.	0
So, let’s get right to it.	0
Joining us right now, the U.S.	0
Senator from Texas.	0
Please welcome Ted Cruz.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Welcome.	0
Thank you, good to be with you.	0
Congratulations on a big endorsement from the governor of the state, Scott Walker.	0
Obviously a great thing for your campaign.	0
We’re going to hear a lot of questions tonight from the voters on the issues.	0
I want to just start by talking to you about a couple of issues of the day.	0
As you know, you talked a little bit today, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski (ph), charged today with Simple Battery.	0
If he was your campaign manager, would you ask him to resign?	0
Of course.	0
Look, it shouldn’t be complicated that members of the campaign staff should not be physically assaulting the press.	0
I mean, that shouldn’t be a complicated decision.	0
He says he’s innocent of all the charges.	0
Well…	0
…  Do you believe it was assault?	0
He has just been charged.	0
I know that the reporter alleged that she was physically assaulted.	0
That I will say, it’s consistent with the pattern of the Trump campaign.	0
Do you think it says something about the campaign itself?	0
About the leadership?	0
The culture of the campaign has been a campaign built on attacks, on insults, and I think there is no place in politics for insults, for personal attacks, for going to the gutter, and there should be no place for physical violence either.	0
I want to ask you about the path ahead for you.	0
you need 85 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination.	0
Not impossible, but highly improbable.	0
Will you admit tonight that a contested convention is your best bet to get the nomination?	0
Not remotely because…	0
Do you think you can get 85 percent?	0
Absolutely, and our path going forward is to get 1,237.	0
Most of the races coming up are either winner-take-all, or winner-take-most.	0
But, you’ve only gotten 30 percent of the delegates so far.	0
We’re half over.	0
Well…	0
…  How do you go from 30 percent to 85 percent?	0
I’ll tell you, the way you do that — it’s the situation.	0
If two guys are hiking in the woods, and a bear start chasing, and you know the old joke that the fellow sits down and starts to put on his running shoes?	0
And the guy turns to his friend and says, “What are you doing?	0
You can’t outrun the bear.”	0
And, the guy says, “I don’t have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you.”	0
That principal is the same thing going forward, if we continue to beat Donald Trump — you know, we just had a few days ago in Utah a massive victory against Donald Trump and we got all of the delegates in Utah.	0
If we continue to beat Donald Trump going forward most of the states are winner-take-all or winner-take-most, and we get North of 80 percent of the delegates simply by beating Donald Trump going forward.	0
But Donald Trump is still way out in front of you.	0
He won Louisiana.	0
You got more delegates out of Louisiana, which he is obviously upset about, but I mean, 85 percent in the remaining races, that’s more than you’ve ever gotten anywhere.	0
Look, but you don’t have to win 85 percent, Anderson.	0
The way it works, you have to win the races going forward but when you win, you get most or all the delegates.	0
And here’s the dynamic that has played out.	0
A year ago there were 17 candidates.	0
It was a fantastic, diverse, dynamic field.	0
The field has narrowed now.	0
And what Donald benefits from is division because Donald has had pretty consistently a floor of about 20 to 25 percent.	0
But he has got a hard ceiling of about 35 to 40 percent that he has a real hard time breaking.	0
And so when there are two or three or four other candidates and they divide the vote, he can win state after state with 30, 35 percent, even 40 percent.	0
Head to head, Donald has an incredibly difficult time breaking 50 percent.	0
The Kasich campaign has made an effort to reach out to your campaign to strike some sort of a pact in order to defeat Donald Trump.	0
Wouldn’t that make sense?	0
Apparently all the reports are so far you’ve not responded.	0
Well, it makes no sense at all.	0
John Kasich has no path to win it.	0
We are competing to win.	0
We’re not competing to stop Trump.	0
We’re competing to win the nomination.	0
John Kasich went 0 for 27.	0
He lost 27 states in a row.	0
He admits though it’s going to go to a contested convention, that’s where he says he can win.	0
Look, I understand, except that it’s against the rules for John Kasich to be on the ballot.	0
The rules provide that in order to be even on the ballot, if no one has 1,237, you have to have won at least 8 states.	0
Now, there are only two candidates who are going to meet that threshold, Donald Trump and me.	0
And so our preferred option is win 1,237 delegates before the convention.	0
We are working hard to do that.	0
And I’ll mention Wisconsin is going to be critical in that.	0
But the second option, which is entirely possible, we could get to a convention where nobody has 1,237 delegates, and we come in with a ton of delegates, Donald Trump comes in with a ton of delegates.	0
And if that happens, then it becomes a battle for the delegates, but the only two names on the ballot are going to be Donald Trump and me.	0
On the rules, those are the only two people that can be voted on.	0
And I think in that situation, we’re in a very strong position to earn the 1,237 votes from the delegates who are elected by the people.	0
I want to talk about some policy here.	0
In the wake of the horrible attacks that we saw in Brussels, you proposed securing our borders, crushing ISIS, stopping refugees.	0
But you also suggested that law enforcement “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” John Kasich said about that proposal: “So what we want to do is start policing Muslim neighborhoods, create more divisions, start policing neighborhoods in here La Crosse?	0
This is politics trying to appeal to people’s base instincts and fears.”	0
Is that what you’re doing?	0
Look, what I believe we should do is we need a commander-in-chief who is actually focused on keeping this country safe.	0
You know, we saw…	0
What does it mean, though, “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods”?	0
How do you decide what neighborhoods — what’s a Muslim neighborhood?	0
Let me answer your question.	0
We had a terror attack in Brussels last week.	0
It was a horrific attack.	0
President Obama could barely be bothered to stop his baseball game with communist dictators to say anything about it.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And when he did, he followed this bizarre pattern that he has followed for year after year after year where he refuses to say the words “radical Islamic” terrorism.	1
Instead what he does, what he did after the Paris terror attack, what he did after San Bernardino, is he goes on television and he lectures Americans about Islamophobia.	0
Enough is enough.	0
How about a president that actually stands up and defends this country?	0
We need a commander-in-chief…	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
So what does that mean, patrol Muslim neighborhoods?	0
What it means is that we target the enemy.	0
Now, there is a difference between Islam and Islamism.	0
Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage violent jihad, to murder or to forcibly convert all infidels.	0
And by infidels, they mean every one of the rest of us.	0
Islamism is our enemy.	0
And when President Obama and Hillary Clinton and the modern Democratic Party play this politically correct game of denying it, it means they don’t fight it effectively.	0
So, for example, let’s talk about the consequences of it.	0
Obama and Hillary both advocate bringing tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America.	0
Right, so you want to stop that, but you did talk about patrolling Muslim neighborhoods.	0
Sure, absolutely.	0
And a lot of folks — you kept saying that worked in New York, but political correctness made the police stop that.	0
Yes.	0
New York Police have pushed back on that.	0
Chief Bratton said that’s just complete bunk.	0
And I want to read you what, in fact — I mean, the guy who ran that program that you say was such a big success says it didn’t lead to any prosecutions, there were no leads from it.	0
Listen, you are right that after I called for increased vigilance protecting us that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and New York’s Mayor Bill de Blasio all attacked me.	0
I wear that as a badge of pride.	0
I will not apologize to anyone…	0
… Bill Bratton, worked for Rudy Giuliani…	0
I understand that the Commissioner who works for Bill de Blasio has a political imperative.	0
de Blasio is a left-wing radical.	0
The commander who oversaw the very program that you claim was as success in New York testified under oath that it didn’t lead to any investigations in the six years.	0
Anderson, in New York, this was a successful program….	0
…  In what way?	0
It was set up under Mayor Michael Bloomberg to monitor and to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization, and to stop radical Islamic terrorism plots before it occurs…	0
…  Can you name one case…	0
There are a number of cases.	0
It identified a bookstore that was a locus for radicalization and allowed law enforcement to after that bookstore, and what happened was when Mayor Bill de Blasio got elected he gave in to political correctness and shut the unit down.	0
Listen, if you want to stop radical Islamic terrorism, the answer isn’t to go hang out in random neighborhoods.	0
It is instead to focus on communities where radicalization is a risk.	0
And, I’ll tell you what Europe has done.	0
Europe has followed the path that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to put us on.	0
That the tragedies, these terror attacks in Europe are a result of failed immigration policies where they’ve allowed vast numbers of Islamic terrorists to come into Europe, and they’re in communities that are isolated.	0
They’re called “No-Go” communities where the law enforcement doesn’t engage in those communities.	0
One in Brussels, Molenbeek, has been a particular incubator for radical Islamic terrorism.	0
Many of these terrorist plots trace back to Molenbeek.	0
My plan is very simple, America should not make the mistakes of Europe.	0
We should not disengage.	0
We should have law enforcement actively engage to stop radicalization before it stops — and, I recognize that the media and the Democrats hate it when someone actually describes who the enemy is.	0
I’ll tell ya’, as President, every single day I will wake up fighting radical Islamic terrorism and working to defeat it.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Turning back to the campaign.	0
It’s obviously been a very rough and tumble week between you and Donald Trump.	0
A salacious story about you was published in “National Enquirer”.	0
You say Donald Trump, the people around him, were responsible for planting that story.	0
Do you have any proof of that?	0
Sure.	0
There’s the story, on its face, quoted on the record, Roger Stone.	0
Former advisor to…	0
…  Roger Stone has been Donald Trump’s Chief Political adviser.	0
He planned and ran his presidential campaign, and he’s been his hatchet man.	0
He spent 40 years as a hatchet man.	0
But, not only that, the head of the “National Enquirer”, a guy named David Pecker, is good friends with Donald Trump.	0
But you don’t know it for a fact that Donald Trump planted that story?	0
Of course I do.	0
When his good friend — you know, the “National Enquirer”, in its history, has never endorsed a presidential candidate until Donald Trump?	0
And, now, David Pecker — look, Donald Trump suggested David Pecker, the head of the “National Enquirer”, should take over “Time” Magazine.	0
Who in their right mind should suggest the head of the “National Enquirer” should take over “Time” magazine?	0
You’ve been very tough recently, but early on the campaign it seemed like you made a political calculation not to go after him.	0
Just last week on a radio program, you said that essentially those candidates who did go after him early on were road kill, you needed to build your base.	0
Back in December you tweeted, “The establishment’s only hope, Trump and me in a cage match, sorry to disappoint, Donald Trump is terrific.”	0
That was after he’d already made fun of Carly Fiorina’s face, after he’d gone after Megyn Kelly.	0
At that point in December, did you really believe Donald Trump was terrific?	0
Look, what I knew was that the media was engaged in a love fest.	0
Giving Donald Trump $2 billion dollars in premium (ph)…	0
…  Sounds like you were engaged in a love fest.	0
Let’s be clear, how many hours of free media do CNN, and FOX, and every other station — you let him call in, and for a year — $2 billion dollars of free media…	1
…  Well, I got to say, we’ve asked you for interviews pretty much every day, and you’ve declined every offer on my program…	0
… Well, Anderson….	0
…  So, you can come on any time…	0
…  I want to point out I’ve been inviting Donald Trump for several days to come and make this a debate.	0
He’s coming later, and he’s terrified to make it a debate because he doesn’t want to actually stand and have his record challenged.	0
But, when you called him terrific back in December, did you really believe that, or was that political calculation?	0
Let me make a point.	0
There has been a distinction that I have followed throughout, which is that I keep the focus on issues and substance, so I’m happy to draw distinction with Donald Trump on the issues, whether it is economic policy — that he doesn’t have a policy to bring jobs back to America, whether it is national security where is advocating for a far too weak foreign policy that leaves us vulnerable.	0
What I’m not interested in doing is what Donald’s pattern has been, which is the personal attacks.	0
It’s going to the gutter, it’s attacking family members.	0
None of that has any place in politics.	0
We ought to be discussing tax policy, we ought to be discussing national security.	0
We ought to be discussing substance…	0
…  Let’s do that now…	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
…  Not engaging in mudslinging…	0
… Let’s go to our first member of the audience.	0
This is Thomas Dougherty (ph).	0
He’s a student from Brookfield (ph) who says he’s still making up his mind.	0
So you could pick up a vote here.	0
Thomas, welcome.	0
Great.	0
Hey, Thomas.	0
Hi, Senator Cruz.	0
My question for you is, how and why does your religion play a part in your political decision-making?	0
Don’t you think it should be more of a moral belief and not something that can interfere with your decision-making when you’re making decisions for all religions in the United States?	0
Well, Thomas, thank you for that question.	0
Listen, with Me, as with many people in America, my faith is an integral part of who I am.	0
I’m a Christian, and I’m not embarrassed to say that.	0
I’m not going to hide that and treat it like it’s something you can’t admit publicly and acknowledge.	0
It’s an important part of who you are.	0
But I also think those in politics have an obligation not to wear their faith on their sleeve.	0
There have been far too many politicians that run around behaving like they’re holier than thou.	0
And I’ll tell you, my attitude as a voter when some politician stands up and says, I’m running because God told me to vote — to run, my reaction as a voter is, great, when God tells me to vote for you, we’ll be on the same page.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And so, listen, I’m not asking you to vote for me because of my personal faith with Jesus Christ.	0
I’m asking you to vote for me because I’ve spent a lifetime fighting to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, fighting to defend the American free enterprise system, and we need a leader who will stand up every day and protect the rights of everyone, whether they’re Christians  or Jews or Muslims or anyone else.	0
The bill of rights protects all Americans.	0
It protects atheists.	0
That’s the beauty of the bill of rights, is that we have the freedom to seek out god, to worship and to live according to our faith and our conscience, and I think the Constitution and Bill of Rights is a unifying principle that can bring us together across faiths, across races, across ethnicity.	0
And we need to come together behind the unifying principles that built America.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you for your question.	0
I want you to meet — this is Tim Matson (ph).	0
His son, Jordan, traveled to Jordan in 2014, fought alongside Kurdish forces that were taking on ISIS.	0
Tim says he is undecided.	0
Tim, welcome.	0
Senator, when Jordan left for Syria, I was furious with him.	0
I couldn’t understand how he could do this.	0
But then I followed his steps on the internet, and I saw the mass murders and beheadings, sometimes of young children, and I understood.	0
Now I know we can’t be police of the world, but there’s lines that have been crossed that no civilized nation should ignore.	0
And we have a nation that’s often said, never again, but there again, here we are.	0
So as commander in chief, will you send an overwhelming force with unrestricted use of power to obliterate ISIS and send a message to those who want to do evil upon the innocents of their fate (ph) if they do this?	0
Well, Tim, thank you for that question.	0
And thank you for your son, Jordan, serving, and thank you for his sacrifice.	0
You know, the question of when to commit U.S. armed forces to combat is the most serious decision any president can make.	0
And I believe the decision to use military force should be keyed to the vital national security interest of this country.	0
Far too often we’ve seen in the last seven years where President Obama has not focused on our national security interests.	0
So, for example, we saw in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi, the dictator there, was a bad man.	0
He had a horrible human rights record.	0
He had been a state sponsor of terrorists.	0
But Gadhafi in his latter years had actually shaped up his conduct pretty dramatically in response to U.S. strength and had become an active participant working with America stopping radical Islamic terrorists — tracking them down, apprehending them, handing them over to us.	0
And what President Obama and Hillary Clinton did is they ended up joining with and leading many world forces in toppling Gadhafi, ultimately killing Gadhafi.	0
And the consequence in Libya is that country was handed over to radical Islamic terrorists.	0
It’s become a war zone of battling war lords.	0
And…	0
The question is about U.S. troops, though, U.S. forces on the ground to defeat ISIS.	0
I understand.	0
And I’m answering the question, Anderson.	0
Thank you.	0
That was an enormous mistake.	0
And the reason they made the mistake is they weren’t focused on U.S. national security interests.	0
They were in the interests of promoting democracy, and toppling a government that ends up handing it over to radical Islamic terrorists is a much worse outcome.	0
We saw a similar thing in Egypt, where Obama and Hillary both cheered the toppling of Hosni Mubarak, the head of Egypt.	0
Egypt was handed over to the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Morsi.	0
The Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization.	0
That was profoundly harmful for U.S. national security interests.	0
Thankfully president el-Sisi is now in charge of Egypt.	0
Now with regard to Syria, Assad is a monster.	0
I agree with you.	0
He’s a horrible man.	0
He has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own citizens.	0
He has murdered women.	0
He has murdered children.	0
He has used chemical weapons against them.	0
But the problem is, if we simply topple Assad, the most likely outcome is that ISIS takes over Syria.	0
And handing Syria over to ISIS, to radical Islamic terrorists who are waging war with us is a mistake.	0
So your question of what we should do, our focus, I believe, in Syria should not be on toppling Assad.	0
Our focus should be on utterly and completely destroying ISIS, because ISIS is our enemy and ISIS has declared war on America and they pose a direct threat to our national security interests.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
In order to topple ISIS, would you be — I mean, his question is sending an overwhelming ground force.	0
Would you be willing to send U.S. troops on the ground?	0
Not just Special Forces as is currently being done.	0
Look, I will do whatever is necessary militarily to defeat ISIS.	0
Now, defeating ISIS is going to have a lot of components.	0
One of the most important components is overwhelming air power.	0
You’ve talked about carpet bombing and just recently you said “carpet bomb them into oblivion.” Lieutenant General Charles Brown Jr., who is the commander of U.S. Air Forces, Central Command,  said carpet bombing is not effective for the operation that we’re actually executing because we’re using precision-guided munitions on a regular basis and, in fact, carpet bombing civilian areas is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.	0
Nobody has talked about targeting civilian areas.	0
What I have suggested we should do is use overwhelming air power.	0
And let me — let’s talk some specifics and some facts.	0
What does carpet bombing mean?	0
I’m trying to answer your question, Anderson.	0
OK.  Just for a fact, ISIS is in many civilian areas.	0
Let’s talk specific facts.	0
The first Persian Gulf War, a little over 25 years ago, we were launching roughly 1,100 air attacks a day.	0
We were using overwhelming airpower.	0
It’s one of the great strengths of the tremendous American military is our air superiority is second to none.	0
Right now, today, Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.	0
Right, but…	0
Compare the — but hold on, let me make my point, please, sir.	0
If you compare those two numbers, 1,100 air attacks a day, we did that for 37 days, and then our troops went in and in a day-and-a-half mopped up what was left of the Iraqi army.	0
Eleven hundred air attacks a day does crushing debilitating damage.	0
Fifteen to 30 a day is photo-op foreign policy.	0
But I’ve talked to commanders who actually did the air campaign who said, look, it’s easy when you’re trying to take out — not easy, but it’s one thing when you are trying take out a government’s military, you can bomb their military-industrial complex, you can bomb factories, you can bomb their centers of command and control, you can bomb barracks.	0
ISIS is a completely different kind of enemy.	0
But you can use all of those tools.	0
So you can take out their command and control headquarters.	0
You can take out their communication.	0
You can take out their means of transportation, ingress and egress.	0
You can take out their oil fields.	0
You can take out their oil refining capacity.	0
You can take out their infrastructure.	0
You can target their troops and their troop movements.	0
And we’re not doing that right now.	0
Overwhelming airpower is the first step, now it’s not the only step, but overwhelming airpower is the first step.	0
The next step is arming the Kurds.	0
The Kurds, the Peshmerga, fighting forces of the Kurds are very, very effective fighters.	0
They’re longtime allies of America.	0
They’re fighting ISIS right now.	0
ISIS is using U.S. military equipment that they seized in Iraq.	0
The Kurds are using outmoded equipment and the Obama administration refuses to arm them because of political reasons.	0
That doesn’t make sense.	0
We ought to be arming the Kurds and let them kill ISIS.	0
And then beyond that the question of Special Forces and ground troops.	0
We should do whatever is necessary to win, but I’ll tell you what I won’t do is I will not send our troops into combat the way Barack Obama is doing with rules of engagement so strict that they cannot fight, they cannot win, and they cannot defeat the enemy.	0
If we’re going to use our troops, we’re going to defeat the enemy.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I want to go to our next questioner.	0
This is Shannon O’Connell.	0
She works in health care.	0
She’s an independent voter.	0
She says she is still undecided.	0
Shannon, welcome.	0
Hi, Shannon.	0
Thank you.	0
My question is more personal in nature.	0
What would you regard as your greatest personal failure and what did you learn from it?	0
You know, those are always — whether in political campaign or a job interview, those are always tricky questions.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
You know, any time you go for a job interview, you sit down and you’re like, OK, what’s your greatest weakness?	0
And, like, the classic answer people give at a job interview, you know, my greatest weakness is I just work too hard.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I’m just such a disciplined employee, I just put my work in front of everything else.	0
Look, there are pros and cons to it.	0
What I will say is I’m a pretty driven guy.	0
That has pros and cons.	0
I have always been a very driven guy.	0
… I’m just such a disciplined employee, I just put my work in front of everything else.	0
Look, there are pros and cons to it.	0
What I will say is I’m a pretty driven guy.	0
That has pros and cons.	0
I have always been a very driven guy.	0
I believe passionately in free-market principles and the Constitution.	0
My whole life — I mean, when I was a teenager, I studied and memorized a shortened mnemonic (ph) version of the Constitution and traveled around as part of a non-profit organization in Houston speaking about the Constitution, speaking about free-market principles.	0
And, you know, a lot of that, I think the reason that I’m so driven on this front has to do with my family background.	0
My father was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, and when my dad came to America, he had nothing, and it really is — it’s an amazing thing when you grow up in the house with someone who’s fled oppression, because I remember when I was a little kid, we’d be watching TV, and there was an urgency to politics.	0
It wasn’t, oh, that’s interesting, a couple of candidates.	0
It was, having principled men and women in office is how you protect yourself from tyranny.	0
Now, I’ll confess, growing up in a Cuban-American household, you’re raised where there are two families — there are two parties.	0
The Republicans and the Communists.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And anyone who is Cuban-American will understand I’m not kidding really with that.	0
Now, I was really saddened to see Barack Obama go and pal around with the Castros and pose under a Che Guevera picture.	0
I mean, it drove that point home.	0
But as a kid, that gives you an urgency.	0
And so at times, listen, I’m hard charging.	0
That means I’ve stepped on some toes.	0
That means I’ve been focused very hard on fighting those fights, and maybe I should have pulled back in some circumstances.	0
So it is a strength and a weakness.	0
But I will say this, I am someone who what you see is what you get.	0
You know what I’m going to do in office.	0
It’s what I’ve done every day.	0
It’s what I believe.	0
It’s what I’ve spent my life fighting for.	0
And I think we’re at a time where we need a president who we know what he will do, and we know we can trust them to follow through on what they’re saying.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Thank you for your question.	0
This is William Wake (ph).	0
He’s got one of the toughest jobs I think there is.	0
He’s a middle school social studies teacher.	0
He says he’s leaning toward voting for you.	0
William?	0
Senator Cruz…	0
Follow your instincts, William.	0
Yes, right.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
My students will often ask me, you know, they’ll say, have you seen or heard what the candidates are saying?	0
And oftentimes it’s not about substance.	0
It’s about, you know, what name we’ve been calling each other.	0
So I guess my question is, is it a good example to set for our youth of America, and should we stay on substance instead of calls each other names?	0
Yes.	0
Well, William, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you for the difference you make teaching kids and teaching in middle school.	0
I mean, middle school is obviously just a really pivotal age.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I worry about that question, what lesson to our kids take watching this?	0
You know, Heidi and I, our girls are 5 and 7.	0
And they’re watching presidential candidates insulting each other, yelling, cursing, attacking family members.	0
I mean, it’s gotten really ugly, and just when you don’t think it can get any uglier, it gets uglier.	0
I think that has no place in politics, and my view — I have no ability to control what another candidate does.	0
But what I can control is my approach.	0
I’ll tell you the promise that I made to the people who joined our campaign from the beginning, the supporters who were with us from the beginning.	0
I said, listen, I can’t promise we’re going to win, I think we will, but I can promise you two things.	0
One, we’re going to work every day with a joyful spirit, we’re going to work every day and put everything weave into this campaign., and number two, we’re going to do so with integrity.	0
We’re not going to go into the gutter.	0
We’re not going to attack people personally.	0
We’re not going to malign their character.	0
We’re going to focus on issues and substance.	0
Now in the course of the campaign, there have been a bunch of candidates engaging in personal insults.	0
I’ve worked very, very hard to stay out of that and say, I’m not going into the gutter.	0
If you attack me personally, I’m not going to respond in kind.	0
Now, if you want to talk about your tax plan, I’ll compare my tax plan to your tax plan.	0
That should be the bread and butter of politics.	0
And it is my hope that at the end of the day that that is the approach that prevails.	0
I think it’s what the people of Wisconsin want.	0
I think it’s what the people of America want.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Over here we have Jason Vorpel (ph).	0
He’s a dairy farmer from Random Lake, Wisconsin.	0
He says he’s voting for you, Senator Cruz — Jason.	0
Thank you, Jason.	0
I am a dairy farmer here in Wisconsin, and dairy farming in my family goes back to the 1800s when my great-great grandparents starting farming with six cows.	0
Today we have 2,800 cows.	0
Wow.	0
And it’s a 24-hour operation.	0
We offer a competitive wage and offer full benefits to all our employees.	0
Most farms in the dairy industry cannot find American-born workers to milk the cows and take care of them.	0
The only ones willing to do this hard work are Latino immigrants who, if we didn’t have them for eight hours, there would be a crisis across the country in our industry.	0
What is the short-term solution to keep our current labor force intact?	0
And what is the long-term solution moving forward?	0
Right.	0
Well, thank you for sharing your experience as a dairy farmer, and, you know, there are farmers across this country who are really hurting.	0
And farmers are hurting from a lot of things.	0
They’re hurting from a federal government whose policies have been making it harder and harder for farmers to survive.	0
They’re hurting from an EPA who is imposing massive burdens on farms.	0
For example, the Waters of the United States Rule where the EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations.	0
And I think we need a president, we need an administration that takes the burdens off farmers so that it is easier to do your job which is incredibly important.	0
Now, when it comes to labor, I understand the need to have labor and that it can be hard to have agricultural labor.	0
You know, I’ll tell you, though, one of the consequences of our immigration system right now, when we’ve got 12 million people who are here illegally, that has an effect of driving down wages for Americans across this country.	0
There was a very interesting article, it was about, oh, a month, maybe six weeks ago in The Wall Street Journal, it was focusing on Arizona.	0
You’ll recall several years ago Arizona put in place really tough laws on illegal immigration.	0
And they were criticized loudly for putting those laws in place.	0
And it was interesting, this Wall Street Journal article, because it talked about what happened in the wake of that law, which is a great many of the illegal immigrants left.	0
They left the state and went elsewhere.	0
And it actually quoted a farmer, and that’s the reason I’m bringing up this example, it quoted a farmer, a fellow in Arizona who was growing peppers.	0
And he complained, he said, listen, all people that we had picking peppers, they left.	0
And he said, I didn’t know what to do.	0
I didn’t  know that we were going to be able to pick our peppers.	0
And what it described that he did is he actually went and invented a new tool to help pick the peppers.	0
And then he went down to the local community college and he ended up hiring Americans coming out of the community college.	0
He had to pay them more.	0
He paid them about $15 an hour.	0
But he continues picking his peppers except he’s doing so in a situation where what has happened in Arizona, the public expenditures have plummeted.	0
Arizona is spending hundreds of millions of dollars less on prisons, on education, on hospitals, for those here illegally.	0
That means that’s hundreds of millions of dollars available to take care of U.S. citizens.	0
And also unemployment has gone down and median wages for Americans have gone up in the construction industry, carpenters.	0
We’re seeing wages going up.	0
And I think the view — our immigration laws should benefit American workers.	0
That should be the focus of immigration laws.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And so what I intend to do as president is, number one, we’re going to secure the border.	0
We’re going to end illegal immigration.	0
We know how to do it.	0
And what’s missing is the political will to get it done.	0
The difference is I will get it done.	0
But beyond that, when it comes to legal immigration, listen, I think on immigration the principles are really simple.	0
Legal, good.	0
Illegal, bad.	0
It’s amazing how many — how many folks in politics, how many folks in the media have trouble understanding that.	0
I’m reminded, you guys remember former Congressman Sonny Bono from “Sonny & Cher”?	0
Years ago Sonny Bono was asked, what’s your view on illegal immigration?	0
He said, well, it’s illegal, isn’t it?	0
We’re going to solve this problem by securing the border and ending illegal immigration.	0
And once we do that, that’s going to drive up wages for Americans across this country.	0
And in the agriculture world, I think the first option should be trying to find American workers.	0
Now that may mean wages come up.	0
It may mean that we have to use more tools.	0
We’ve seen in Arizona that has happened.	0
And beyond that, our legal immigration system, if there are needs in the labor force and American workers not available to do it, that’s where legal immigration should come in.	0
But it should be in a situation where you’re vetting the people rather than just having people come in that we don’t know who they are, and we don’t know their criminal history, we don’t know their background.	0
It should be through the legal system targeted in a way that protects American workers.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We’re going to have more with Senator Cruz in just a moment.	0
We’re going to take a short break.	0
Also ahead tonight in Milwaukee, John Kasich and Donald Trump.	0
But more with Ted Cruz coming up next.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And welcome back.	0
We’re here at the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee, taking voter questions for Senator Ted Cruz.	0
John Kasich, Donald Trump coming up.	0
But more voter questions now for Senator Cruz.	0
I want to start, though — more than six months ago, you pledged to support the Republican nominee.	0
When things started getting rough with Donald Trump, you said you were going to stick with that pledge because you’d given your word.	0
I saw in an interview with my colleague, Sunlen Serfaty – I think it was just yesterday.	0
You’re said you’re not in a habit of supporting people who attack your wife and attack your family.	0
Do you still stand by the pledge to support whoever the nominee, even if it’s Donald Trump?	0
Well, Anderson, as you mentioned, what I said is true.	0
I’m not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family.	0
I think that is going beyond the line.	0
I think our wives, I think our kids should be off limits.	0
They don’t belong in the attacks.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And, listen, I’m not an easy person to tick off, but when you go after my wife, when you go after my daughters, that does it.	0
And I think — I want this race to stay focused on policy and issues and solutions to the real problems facing America.	0
That’s where I’m going to stay focused.	0
But if other candidates don’t, I think that’s beyond the pale.	0
So I just have to follow-up, if Donald Trump is the GOP nominee, would you support him?	0
Let me tell you my solution to that.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Donald is not going to be the GOP nominee.	0
We’re going to beat him.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I would be remiss if I didn’t follow-up.	0
That’s my greatest failing.	0
That was the question earlier for you.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
My greatest failing is sometimes I don’t follow up, so not to give into that, I mean, I got to ask, I will assume by you saying  you would not support him, that the answer is you would not support him if he is the nominee?	0
I gave you my answer.	0
Listen, I think nominating Donald Trump would be an absolute train wreck.	0
I think it would hand the general election to Hillary Clinton.	0
Poll after poll after poll shows Donald Trump losing 10, 11, 12 points or more.	0
I don’t want to see the White House given over to Hillary Clinton.	0
I don’t want to see us lose the Senate and House, lose the Supreme Court for a generation, lose the Bill of Rights.	0
I think nominating Donald Trump is a disaster, and so the answer to that is not to scream and yell and cry and attack him, the answer to that is to beat him at the ballot box.	0
That’s what we’re working every day to do.	0
It’s what we’re campaigning every day here in Wisconsin to do.	0
This is Benjamin Miller.	0
He’s a student at University of Wisconsin.	0
He says he’s also voting for you next week.	0
Benjamin, welcome.	0
Good evening, senator.	0
Benjamin, welcome.	0
Both Paris and now Brussels have suffered blindside attacks by Islamic terrorists.	0
Although I fear a terrorist attack on the United States, I have a greater fear of the government taking away my constitutional freedoms and privacy in the name of security.	0
Yes.	0
As president, how will you ensure that America is not blindly attacked, while also maintaining the privacy of the American people?	0
Well, Benjamin, thank you for that question, and it’s a very important question.	0
You know, there are some in politics who say it’s an either/or choice.	0
We can either protect America or protect our civil liberties.	0
I don’t accept that choice.	0
I think it is possible to walk and chew gum at the same time.	0
I think it is possible — and the difference — something the Obama administration is not very good at — they’re not very good at distinguishing between bad guys and good guys.	0
So over and over again, the Obama administration’s solution, for example, when it comes to surveillance, was to monitor the phone calls or the e-mails of millions of law-abiding citizens, but because of their political correctness, because they won’t focus on and identify radical Islamic terrorists, they don’t actually target the bad guys.	0
It’s why it’s so important — and you know, it’s interesting, Benjamin, people in the media, sometimes they ask, why does it matter whether Obama will say the words “radical Islamic terrorism?”  It matters because if you don’t identify the problem, you don’t devote — you don’t direct law enforcement and national security resources to stopping it.	0
I’ll give a specific example.	0
My home state of Florida, Fort Hood, Nidal Hassan committed a horrific terrorist attack there.	0
Now, the  Obama administration knew before the attack that Nidal Hassan communicated with Anwar Al Awlaki, a known radical Islamic cleric.	0
They knew that Nidal Hassan had asked about the permissibility of waging jihad and murdering his fellow soldiers.	0
And yet for whatever reason, political correctness or what have you, they didn’t do anything.	0
If we find out that a member of the Armed Services is talking with a radical Islamic cleric and asking about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers, within minutes, MPs should show up at his door and put him in handcuffs.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But they didn’t do that, and Nidal Hassan murdered 14 innocent souls, including an unborn child, yelling “allahu akbar.”  And then the Obama administration in truly a stunning display of political correctness defined that terrorist attack as workplace violence.	0
We need to direct our resources at going after the Nidal Hassans, going after the radical Islamic terrorists, and we can do that at the same time as not infringing the privacy of law-abiding Americans, distinguishing between the bad guys and the good guys.	0
That’s what this administration hadn’t been doing.	0
Thank you for your question.	0
This is Victoria Ostry (ph), a small business owner from Brookefield (ph).	0
She says she is also voting for you next week.	0
Victoria?	0
Hi, Senator Cruz.	0
Hi, Victoria.	0
Women are more than 50 percent of the voting electorate.	0
What have you done, and what are you going to do to convince and persuade women to vote for you?	0
Well, Victoria, thank you for that question, and you’re absolutely right.	0
You know, I will say one of the things I’ve really been blessed in my life is that I have a grown up surrounded by strong women.	0
My mom is someone who I admire immensely.	0
My mom is Irish-Italian.	0
She grew up Wilmington, Delaware.	0
She grew up in a working-class family.	0
Her mom was the second youngest of 17 kids.	0
And, my mom became the first person in her family ever to go to college.	0
And, that was not easy for her because my grandfather, her dad, he was not an easy man.	0
He was a drunk, and he didn’t think women should be educated.	0
And, so my mom stood up to her father.	0
She stood up to him, confronted him and she ended up going Rice.	0
She majored in math in 1956., and then she got hired at Shell as a computer programmer.	0
Now, you want to talk about two industries, computer science and oil and gas, neither one of which were welcoming to women, and my mom was at the intersection of them both.	0
And, I remember my mom used to tell me a lot when I was a kid, she said, she very deliberately didn’t learn how to type.	0
She said, look, it was the 1950s.	0
I understood the world I was living.	0
She didn’t want to be walking down the hall and have some man stop her and say, Sweetheart, would you type this for me?	0
She wanted to be able to respond with a clean conscience and smile and say, I would love to help you out, but I don’t know how to type.	0
(APPLAUSE))	0
I guess you’re going to have to use me as a computer programmer instead.	0
And, whether it’s my mom, who as a pioneer computer programmer — she’s 81 now, she’s been a best friend to me my whole life.	0
She’s an amazing grandmother to our two little girls.	0
Whether it’s my wife, Heidi, who is the daughter of Christian Missionaries, she lived in Africa as a kid several times.	0
She’s someone who has been an incredible businesswoman.	0
She’s strong.	0
Listen, when you’re married to a strong woman professional, you see the nonsense that women deal with in the business environment.	0
You see the garbage they put up with.	0
And, it makes you mad.	0
I’ve been blessed my whole life to be surrounded by strong women.	0
I think women right now are particularly concerned about the direction of this country, are particularly concerned our kids are going to have, what kind of country we’re giving to the next generation.	0
I think women quite rightly are very concerned about safety and security, and a president that’s protecting us from terrorists.	0
And, I believe what protects women — you know, the Democrats love to put everyone in a little pigeon hole, and so this is a woman’s issue, this is a Hispanic issue, this is an African-American issue.	0
Listen, I believe every issue is a woman’s issue, and the focus of my campaign is on three things.	0
It’s on jobs, freedom, and security.	0
Bringing back the opportunity, raising wages, bringing jobs back to America, I think that is resonating powerfully with women, and fighting to protect the Bill of Rights, and equal opportunity for women and men, and everyone.	0
And, I’ll tell you there’s no one I fight harder for than our two little girls, Caroline and Catherine who are the loves of my life, and who can do anything.	0
And, I want to make sure they have a world they can live in where they have the opportunity to do anything.	0
Senator, thank you very much.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I’m going to try and get time for two more questions.	0
I want you to meet Marv Simcakoski, he’s from Stevens Point, he says at this point he’s undecided.	0
Marv, welcome.	0
Thank you both.	0
My son, Jason, was a former Marine who was killed by over-prescription of medication while he was an in-patient at the V.A.	0
facility in Tomo, Wisconsin.	0
Every day you see stories and news about people all over Wisconsin, people from rural areas, big cities, and small towns who are addicted to opioids and heroin.	0
There is bipartisan legislation in front of congress right now named after my son which would, in part, require stronger opiate prescribing guidelines for V.A.	0
providers.	0
Will you support this bipartisan legislation, and do you support requiring stronger opiate prescribing guidelines, not only for the V.A., but for doctors across this country?	0
Well, Marv, thank you for sharing your story, and thank you for your son’s service and his sacrifice.	0
I’m sorry that you lost son, Jason.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And this is a tragedy we’re seeing across the country.	0
We’re seeing veterans coming back struggling with PTSD.	0
Struggling to get their health care needs treated, treated properly.	0
We’re seeing a V.A.	0
that is dysfunctional.	0
A V.A.	0
that is lying.	0
One of the things we need is we need real accountability in the V.A.	0
I give you my word, if I am president, there will be accountability in the V.A.	0
Those that have lied, those that have wrongfully denied care, they will be terminated.	0
And if they broke the law, they will be prosecuted.	0
We also need reform in the V.A.	0
so that veterans have the power to choose their own doctors.	0
Whether they want to choose the V.A.	0
or a private doctor, there’s no reason your son, Jason, couldn’t have gone to the doctor down the street.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Now, I agree with you, we need greater scrutiny, greater involvement preventing opioid abuse.	0
You look at the prevalence of heroin — and I would note this is a tragedy.	0
Roughly 50,000 people a year die of drug overdoses.	0
More people in America die of drug overdoses than die in car crashes.	0
And Marv, I’m sorry to say, you and I are both members of a horrible club because I lost my sister, Miriam, to a drug overdose.	0
And so I’ve seen first hand — and it actually started — it started when she was in a car accident, and she got prescribed painkillers.	0
And she kept on taking the painkillers, and then she started taking strong, and she started taking stronger.	0
And Miriam led a difficult and troubled life.	0
She made a lot of very poor decisions.	0
And then just a few years ago, she took too many pills one night, and her son came in and found her dead.	0
This is an epidemic that is destroying families across America.	0
I’ am sorry for your family’s loss.	0
I’m sorry.	0
My nephew, Joey, her son, someone I’m really proud of.	0
He’s endured his mom’s difficult journey, and he’s working a good job.	0
He’s a responsible — he’s a terrific young man.	0
But we need a federal government that focuses on stopping this drug abuse, whether it is prescription drug abuse or whether it is illegal narcotics like heroin.	0
And one of the most important ways to stop that — you know, unfortunately my sister, Miriam, ended up going down that path, going down the path of crack cocaine and drugs that destroyed her life.	0
One of the ways to prevent that is we need to secure the border.	0
We need to get serious about stopping the incredible flow from Mexican drug cartels that are poisoning our kids.	0
And you have my commitment as president — I’m not going to talk about it.	0
I’m not going to make empty promises.	0
But we are going to devote the full resources of the federal government to finally, finally, finally  secures the border, stopping illegal immigration, but stopping the deluge of drugs that is coming into this country and destroying the lives of people all across this country.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
This is Tim Omer.	0
He says he is leaning in your favor.	0
Tim, welcome.	0
Hey, Tim.	0
Welcome to Wisconsin, Senator.	0
Thank you.	0
As a growing company, our biggest challenge is finding talented and qualified people to fill all the positions that we have open in our company.	0
As president of the United States, what could you do to help us find those talented people, find those quality people, build up the pool of people so that we can fill those positions and continue to grow our business?	0
Tim, tell me what kind of company do you have?	0
We’re Wisconsin cheese.	0
Wisconsin cheese, fabulous!	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I will confess something.	0
And as my wife, Heidi, is my witness, my favorite food in all the world is cheese.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And I am not says that to pander in Wisconsin.	0
But if you wouldn’t point it out here, where would you point it out?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Listen, it is a huge problem we see of a need for a trained workforce and a need for a workforce that’s prepared and wants to work.	0
You know, as I meet with small business owners all across the country, I hear those concerns over and over and over again that it’s hard to get people who are qualified and who want to work and are prepared to work, and that’s a real challenge.	0
And, you know, the key to jobs and job creation is small businesses, is doing what you do.	0
How many employees do you guys have?	0
About 300.	0
About 300.	0
I mean, that’s where job creation comes from.	0
It comes from small businesses.	0
Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses.	0
Now, in terms of getting new and able workers, we need to do several things.	0
Number one, we need to reform education.	0
You know, the step to having well-trained workers is having a strong education program.	0
And if you look at education right now, number one, I think the federal government needs to get the heck out of it.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
It’s one of the reasons I promised on the very first day in office that I’m going to direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And I think what we ought to be doing is abolishing the federal Department of Education and block-granting that money to send it back to Wisconsin.	0
I think the people of Wisconsin know much better what to do with that money.	0
And part of that money, I think, should be directed at school choice programs, and allowing people who are trapped in failing schools to have the option of going to private schools, going to parochial schools, injecting competition in failing schools to empower parents and empower students.	0
I think school choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st Century.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And part of that money as well in Wisconsin ought to be directed to vocational training, ought to be directed to different nontraditional ways where people can earn skills, whether it’s distance learning, whether it is using the Internet, using options where your only option isn’t spending $50,000 a year at a four-year college but expanding the options for people to get education.	0
I think that is a critical piece to improving the environment.	0
And another critical piece is changing our welfare program.	0
You know, our welfare program right now traps people in dependency.	0
Now, my view on welfare is that the social safety net, it should be a trampoline and not a hammock.	0
That the whole purpose of the social safety net should be to get you back on your feet.	0
Everyone falls on hard times, but you’re not helping someone trapping them in dependence.	0
And I’ll tell you, I visited with a fellow who owns a cookie factory.	0
Tell you, between cookies and cheese, you really can have a great party right there.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
But he owns a cookie factory.	0
And he talked to me about where in the 1990s when Congress passed welfare reform, when Congress put in place a strong work requirement for welfare, and you recall the liberals in the media were saying, you’re going to throw people out on the street, people are going to be starving, it’s going to be terrible.	0
It’s one of the most successful public policy reforms we’ve ever seen.	0
Millions of people left welfare and got jobs.	0
This fellow who owns the cookie factory described to me how suddenly they had people lining up to work.	0
Because they weren’t getting paid in perpetuity to stay at home and watch “Gilligan’s Island.” They had to go get a job.	0
And you know what, if you help someone get a job, ultimately that is giving them the dignity of work.	0
I believe every American wants to have that dignity to provide for their families.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
We’ve got to wrap it up.	0
I want to thank Senator Cruz very much for being with us.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
When come back, Donald Trump, as our townhall continues here in downtown Milwaukee.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Good evening.	0
I'm John Dickerson.	0
This holiday weekend, as America honors our first president, we're about to hear from six men who hope to be the 45th.	0
The candidates for the Republican nomination are here in South Carolina for their ninth debate, one week before this state holds the first-in-the-South primary.	0
George Washington wrote that the truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light.	0
We hope to shed some light on the candidates' positions tonight to help voters make up their minds.	0
So gentlemen, please join us on stage.	0
[ applause ]	0
With us tonight — with us tonight are retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.	0
[ applause ]	0
Businessman Donald Trump of New York.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.	0
[ applause ]	0
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida.	0
[ applause ]	0
And Governor John Kasich of Ohio.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, as most of you have heard by now, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died today at the age of 79.	0
He was the longest-serving member of the court, appointed by President Reagan in 1986.	0
Justice Scalia was the court's leading conservative, and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar.	0
Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia.	0
Thank you.	0
We will talk to the candidates about Justice Scalia and the road ahead when the debate begins in a moment.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Before we get started, candidates, here are the rules.	0
When we ask you a question, you will have one minute to answer, and 30 seconds more if we ask a follow-up.	0
If you're attacked by another candidate, you get 30 seconds to respond.	0
And here's how we keep time.	0
After we ask a question, you'll get a green light.	0
The yellow light means you have 30 seconds left to finish your answer, and when time is up, the light turns red.	0
That means please stop talking.	0
If you keep talking, you'll hear this.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
You don't want to hear that.	0
Joining me in the questioning tonight, my CBS News colleague, chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, and Kimberley Strassel, who is on the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal.	0
And you can participate in the debate through our partnership with Twitter.	0
"Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag ""#GOPDebate."""	0
So, let's begin.	0
First, the death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court.	0
Mr. Trump, I want to start with you.	0
You've said that the president shouldn't nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia.	0
If you were president and had a chance, with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldn't it be an abdication, to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?	0
Well, I can say this.	0
If the president, and if I were president now, I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice.	0
I'm sure that, frankly, I'm absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it.	0
I hope that our Senate is going to be able — Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.	0
In times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor — we have some fantastic people.	0
But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism.	0
It's a tremendous blow, frankly, to our country.	0
So, just to be clear on this, Mr. Trump, you're O.K.	0
with the president nominating somebody ...	0
...	0
I think he's going to do it whether or I'm O.K.	0
with it or not.	0
I think it's up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it.	0
It's called delay, delay, delay.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, I want to get your thoughts on this.	0
Justice Scalia was a real believer, obviously, in the strict word of the Constitution.	0
"Now, Harry Reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be, quote, ""shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential constitutional responsibilities."""	0
Where do you come down on this?	0
Well, John, first of all, if I were president, we wouldn't have the divisions in the country we have today.	0
I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia, it's amazing — it's not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia, nine children here today, their father didn't wake up.	0
His wife, sad, but I just wish we hadn't run so fast into politics.	0
Here's my concern about this.	0
The country is so divided right now, and now we're going to see another partisan fight take place.	0
I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody.	0
If you were to nominate somebody, let's have him pick somebody that's going to have unanimous approval, and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination.	0
I don't think that's going to happen, and I would like the president just to, for once here, put the country first.	0
We're going to have an election for president very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.	0
And so I believe the president should not move forward, and I think that we ought to let the next president of the United States decide who is going to run that Supreme Court with a vote by the people of the United...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson.	0
Dr. Carson, you, like others, put out a statement after the death was announced, and you said the president should delay.	0
You've written a book on the Constitution recently.	0
What does the Constitution say about whose duty it is here to act in this kind of a situation?	0
Well, the current Constitution actually doesn't address that particular situation, but the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court, obviously, is a very important part of our governmental system.	0
And when our Constitution was put in place, the average age of death was under 50, and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal.	0
Obviously, that has changed, and it's something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point.	0
But, we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country.	0
I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks.	0
And that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame.	0
And we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land.	0
But, right now, we're not going to get healing with President Obama.	0
That's very United Nations clear.	0
So, I...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
... fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time.	0
Senator Rubio, you're a...	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, you're a lawyer.	0
Quickly, can you address the issue of whether the Constitution tells us who has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices?	0
And then, also, the Senate Republicans last year floated an idea of removing the filibuster for Senate — excuse me, for Supreme Court nominations.	0
You seemed open to that.	0
What's your feeling on that now?	0
Well, let me first talk about Justice Scalia.	0
His loss is tremendous, and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family.	0
He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic.	0
You talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the Constitution, who understood that the Constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment, but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning.	0
Justice Scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic.	0
His dissent, for example, on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work.	0
And, of course, his dissent on Obergefell as well.	0
No.	0
2, I do not believe the president should appoint someone.	0
And it's not unprecedented.	0
In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.	0
And it remind us of this, how important this election is.	0
Someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the Supreme Court, and it will begin by filling this vacancy that's there now.	0
And we need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document.	0
It is to be interpreted as originally meant.	0
Quickly, though, on this question...	0
[ applause ]	0
Very quickly, Senator, on this specific question, though.	0
You were once in favor of dropping the threshold...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
That's not accurate.	0
... majority — you were never in favor of that?	0
No, I've never — there has been, for example, today, according to the changes Harry Reid made, appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority, but not Supreme Court justices.	0
And I think today you see the wisdom of why we don't want that to change.	0
Because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the Senate, Harry Reid and Barack Obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice, like the ones Barack Obama has imposed on us already.	0
O.K.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Bush, I would like to ask you, conservatives for a long time have felt like that their Republican presidents have picked justices that didn't turn out to be real conservatives.	0
Right.	0
Bernie Sanders has said he would have a litmus test.	0
He would make sure that he appointed a justice who was going to overturn Citizens United.	0
If they can have a litmus test for a nominee, what about you?	0
Would you have a litmus test for a nominee?	0
And what would it be?	0
Not on specific issues, not at all.	0
I think the next president — if I'm president, I will appoint people — I'll nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary.	0
The problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the Senate because they didn't have a record.	0
And the problem is that sometimes we're surprised.	0
The simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record, similar to Justice Scalia, that is a lover of liberty, that believes in limited government, that consistently applied that kind of philosophy, that didn't try to legislator from the bench, that was respectful of the Constitution.	0
And then fight and fight, and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes.	0
Of course, the president, by the way, has every right to nominate Supreme Court justices.	0
I'm an Article II guy in the Constitution.	0
We're running for the president of the United States.	0
We want a strong executive for sure.	0
But in return for that, there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination, and there's no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the Senate.	0
Right, so, Senator Cruz, the Constitution...	0
[ applause ]	0
"So, Senator Cruz, the Constitution says the president ""shall appoint with advice and consent from the Senate,"" just to clear that up."	0
So he has the constitutional power.	0
But you don't think he should.	0
Where do you set that date if you're president?	0
Does it begin in election year, in December, November, September?	0
And once you set the date, when you're president, will you abide by that date?	0
Well, we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year.	0
And let me say, Justice Scalia...	0
Just can I — I'm sorry to interrupt, were any appointed in an election year, or is that just there were 80 years...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Eighty years of not confirming.	0
For example, L.B.J.	0
nominated Abe Fortas.	0
Fortas did not get confirmed.	0
He was defeated.	0
But Kennedy was confirmed in '88.	0
No, Kennedy was confirmed in '87...	0
He was appointed in '87.	0
He was appointed in...	0
... confirmed in '88.	0
That's the question, is it appointing or confirming, what's the difference?	0
In this case it's both.	0
But if I could answer the question...	0
Sorry, I just want to get the facts straight for the audience.	0
But I apologize.	0
[ booing and laughter ]	0
Justice Scalia was a legal giant.	0
He was somebody that I knew for 20 years.	0
He was a brilliant man.	0
He was faithful to the Constitution.	0
He changed the arc of American legal history.	0
And I'll tell you, his passing tonight, our prayers are with his family, with his wife, Maureen, who he adored, his nine children, his 36 grandkids.	0
But it underscores the stakes of this election.	0
We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states.	0
We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia's seminal decisions, that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms.	0
"We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans — and the stakes of this election, for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say, ""We're not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee."""	0
And then for the state of South Carolina, one of the most important judgments for the men and women of South Carolina to make is who on this stage has the background, the principle, the character, the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court?	0
That will be what I will do if I'm elected president.	0
All right.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator Cruz.	0
All right, we're going to move on to national security here, and we are going to — I want to read a quote from Secretary Robert Gates, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served for eight year — under eight presidents.	0
"And this is what he said about Republican candidates, quote, ""Part of the concern that I have with the campaign is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the way the world really works."""	0
So, in that spirit, we're going to work tonight to be more specific.	0
Mr. Trump, I want to start with you.	0
You have said as president, you'll get up to speed very quickly.	0
You'll know more quickly as president than any of the experts.	0
So, you've been elected president.	0
It's your first day in the Situation Room.	0
What three questions do you ask your national security experts about the world?	0
What we want to do, when we want to do it, and how hard do we want to hit?	0
Because we are going to have to hit very, very hard to knock out ISIS.	0
We're going to also have to learn who our allies are.	0
We have allies, so-called allies, we're spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people — we have no idea who they are in Syria.	0
Do we want to stay that route, or do we want to go and make something with Russia?	0
I hate to say Iran, but with Russia, because we — and the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated in my entire life.	0
It's a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal.	0
But very important...	0
[ applause ]	0
Not only a disgrace, it's a disgrace and an embarrassment.	0
But very important, who are we fighting with?	0
Who are we fighting for?	0
What are we doing?	0
We have to rebuild our country.	0
"But we have to — I'm the only one on this stage that said: ""Do not go into Iraq."	1
"Do not attack Iraq."""	0
Nobody else on this stage said that.	1
And I said it loud and strong.	0
And I was in the private sector.	0
I wasn't a politician, fortunately.	0
"But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, ""You'll destabilize the Middle East."""	1
That's exactly what happened.	0
I also said, by the way, four years ago, three years ago, attack the oil, take the wealth away, attack the oil and keep the oil.	0
They didn't listen.	0
They just started that a few months ago.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio — just 30 seconds on this question, Senator Rubio.	0
Are those the questions you would ask?	0
No.	0
I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of.	0
No.	0
1 is, what are we doing in the Asia-Pacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States.	0
No.	0
2 is, what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the Sunni-Shia conflict driven by the Shia arc that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East, also the growing threat of ISIS.	0
And the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20 percent of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine.	0
Let me ask you a follow-up, a full, proper question, then.	0
[ applause ]	0
Violent extremists are operating or active in 40 countries.	0
Some 80 countries are in different degrees of instability.	0
And so, that's just the crises overseas.	0
Barack Obama walked into an economic collapse when he came into office.	0
We face international health crises, from Ebola to Zika.	0
So, there is a lot of opportunity for crisis, as you have talked about.	0
What would you point to in your past to show voters that you've been in a crisis and that you've been tested when that inevitable crisis comes when you're president?	0
Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago.	0
One of the hardest decisions you'll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life.	0
So, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members.	0
And it was hard because you looked at the pictures.	0
I saw the same images people saw.	0
I'm the father of children.	0
I saw the images of these little children — been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders, and we were angry.	0
Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.	0
And then I looked at Barack Obama's plan.	0
Barack Obama's plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse.	0
It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.	0
So it was a difficult decision to make, and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it, and I voted against Barack Obama's plan to use force, and it was the right decision.	0
Dr. Carson, I want to ask you a question...	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, you said you've had more 2 a.m. — 2 a.m. phone calls than anybody up on this stage.	0
But when those 2 a.m. phone calls came, you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did, all of that learning.	0
So if you were to be president, though, you wouldn't have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the 2 a.m. phone call comes.	0
So isn't that a liability?	0
No, it isn't.	0
First of all, let me go back to your first question for me.	0
It wasn't phrased as who gets to nominate Supreme Court appointees.	0
Of course that's the president.	0
So I know that there are some left-wing media who would try to make hay on that.	0
Secondly, thank you for including me in the debate.	0
Two questions already.	0
This is great.	0
Now, as far...	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
...as far as those 2 a.m. phone calls are concerned, judgment is what is required.	0
And the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very, very difficult and very unique.	0
One of the things that I was known for is doing things that have not been done before.	0
So no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before.	0
That's where judgment comes in.	0
And that, I think, is a situation that we're in right now, a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation, and it comes in very handy in those situations.	0
Governor Kasich, Russia is being credited...	0
[ applause ]	0
...Russia is being credited with bombing U.S.-backed rebels on behalf of Assad in Aleppo and Syria.	0
They've also moved into the Crimea, eastern Ukraine.	0
You've said you want to punch them in the nose.	0
What does that mean?	0
What are you going to do?	0
First of all — yes.	0
First of all, look, we have to make it clear to Russia what we expect.	0
We don't have to declare an enemy, rattle a sword or threaten, but we need to make it clear what we expect.	0
No.	0
1 is we will arm the folks in Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom.	0
They deserve it.	0
There will be no ifs, ands or buts about it.	0
Secondly, an attack on NATO, trumped up on any excuse of Russian-speaking people, either in the NATO countries or in Finland or Sweden, is going to be an attack on us.	0
And look, I think we have an opportunity as America to put something really great together again.	0
The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Gulf states, they all know they're at risk.	0
We need to look into Europe, we look at France, we look at Germany and the migrants.	0
We look at Belgium, we look at Britain.	0
Everybody now is being threatened by radical Islam.	0
We have an opportunity to lead.	0
You know, the fact of the matter is the world is desperate for our leadership.	0
Sometimes they may — they may make a remark here or there that we don't like, but frankly, the world needs us.	0
And we have an opportunity now to assemble a coalition of the civilized people, those who respect civilization, the rights of women, the rights to protest, to be able to reassert our leadership all across this globe again and make sure this century is going to be the best we've ever seen.	0
Governor...	0
[ applause ]	0
...Governor Bush.	0
Yes.	0
You said defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad.	0
But wouldn't that also put us into conflict with Russia, a country that supports Assad?	0
So doesn't that mean, effectively, Assad's there to stay?	0
No, it doesn't, and that's the problem.	0
The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, thinking that this is a policy that works, this policy of containment with ISIS.	0
It's a complete, unmitigated disaster.	0
And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder, but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees aren't a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists.	0
This is the problem.	0
Donald Trump brought up the fact that he would — he'd want to accommodate Russia.	0
Russia is not taking out ISIS.	0
They're — they're attacking our — our — our team, the team that we've been training and the team that we've been supporting.	0
It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that Russia could be a positive partner in this.	0
They are on the run.	0
They are making — every time we step back, they're on the run.	0
The question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do — what three things would you do.	0
I would restore the military, the sequester needs to be reversed.	0
I would have a strategy to destroy ISIS, and I would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to Iran's ambitions, and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for Iran to do what it's doing, which is to move towards a nuclear weapon.	0
Those three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
... in 2017.	0
Mr. Trump, you're...	0
[ applause ]	0
...Mr. Trump, you were mentioned here.	0
You did say that you could get along very well with Vladimir Putin.	0
You did at one point say let Russia take care of ISIS...	0
...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
called me a genius, I like him so far, I have to tell you.	0
Let me just tell you this.	0
Jeb is so wrong.	0
Jeb is absolutely self — just so you understand, you know what that is?	0
That's Jeb's special interest and lobbyist talking.	0
Look, let me just tell you something, Jeb — Jeb is so wrong.	0
You got to fight ISIS first.	0
You fight ISIS first.	0
Right now you have Russia, you have Iran, you have them with Assad, and you have them with Syria.	0
You have to knock out ISIS.	0
They're chopping off heads.	0
These are animals.	0
You have to knock 'em out.	0
You have to knock them off strong.	0
You decide what to do after, you can't fight two wars at one time.	0
If you listen to him, and you listen to some of the folks that I've been listening to, that's why we've been in the Middle East for 15 years, and we haven't won anything.	0
We've spent $5 trillion dollars in the Middle East with thinking like that.	0
We've spent $5...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...Lindsey Graham, who backs him, had zero on his polls.	0
Let me just say something — we've spent — we've spent.	0
I only tell the truth, lobbyists.	0
We've spent $5 trillion dollars all over the — we have to rebuild our country.	0
We have to rebuild our infrastructure.	0
You listen to that, you're going to be there for another 15...	0
... All right...	0
... You'll end up with World War III...	0
... All right, Governor Bush, please respond.	0
The very basic fact is that Vladimir Putin is not going to be an ally of the United States.	0
The whole world knows this.	0
It's a simple, basic fact.	0
[ applause ]	0
They're not taking out — they're not even attempting to take out ISIS.	0
They're attacking the troops that we're supporting.	0
We need to create a coalition, Sunni-led coalition on the ground with our special operators to destroy ISIS and bring about stability.	0
And you can't do that with Assad in power.	0
He has...	0
... We're supporting troops...	0
... Let me finish...	0
... that we don't even know who they are.	0
...	0
O.K., settle...	0
...	0
This is ridiculous...	0
... We're supporting troops that we don't even know who they are...	0
... All right, Mr. Trump, all right...	0
We have no idea who they are.	0
Gentleman, I think we're going to leave that there.	0
I've got a question for Senator...	0
...	0
This is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows.	0
... Oh, yeah, yeah...	0
...	0
This is a guy who thinks that Hillary Clinton is a great negotiator in Iran...	0
... Let 44 million in New Hampshire, it was practically	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
...	0
This is a man who insults his way to the nomination...	0
... 44 million — give me a break.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... All right, all right, gentlemen, gentlemen, let's leave it there so I can ask a question of Senator Cruz, who's also running for president.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, you talked about the first Gulf War as being a kind of model for your focused and determined effort to go after ISIS.	0
But there were 700,000 ground troops as a part of that, and you don't have a ground component to your plan.	0
Why?	0
Well, we need to focus on what the objective is, you know?	0
Your question about the first three questions you would ask in this Situation Room.	0
I think it is a problem if the president, commander in chief, we've elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on Day 1.	0
If you look at the threats facing this country, the single gravest threat, national security threat, is the threat of a nuclear Iran.	0
That's why I've pledged on Day 1 to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal, and anyone that thinks you can negotiate Khamenei does not understand the nature of Khamenei.	0
When it comes to ISIS, we've got to have a focused objective.	0
One of the problems of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's foreign policy, and, sadly, too many establishment Republicans in Washington, is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country.	0
They focus on nation building, they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy, and it ends up undermining our national security.	0
Now, with regard to ISIS, we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war.	0
They've declared a jihad on us.	0
Now, what do we need...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...to carry that out.	0
We need overwhelming air power, we need to arm the Kurds, who can be our boots on the ground, and if ground troops are necessary, then we should employ them, but it shouldn't be politicians demonstrating political toughness.	0
It should be military expert judgment carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief.	0

Very quickly, 30-second follow-up.	0
You've said that, essentially, the Kurds would be the American ground forces in there.	0
The criticism that experts have on that is that the Kurds only can work within their territory.	0
If they take larger amounts of territory, you have an ethnic war with the Arabs.	0
So the Kurds can't really do as much as you seem to be putting on their backs.	0
We have Kurds in both Iraq and Syria.	0
They are fighting ISIS right now.	0
They are winning victories right now.	0
ISIS is using American military equipment they've seized in Iraq.	0
And the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds, the pesh merga, the fighting forces who have been longtime allies.	0
We ought to be arming them and letting them fight.	0
Now, if we need to embed Special Forces to direct our overwhelming air power, if it is required to use ground troops to defeat ISIS, we should use them, but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage.	0
The first Persian Gulf War, we launched 1,100 air attacks a day.	0
Today, we're launching between 15 and 30.	0
We're not using the tools we have, and it's because the commander in chief is not focused on defeating the enemy.	0
All right.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
[ applause ]	0
...On Monday, George W. Bush will campaign in South Carolina for his brother.	0
As you've said tonight, and you've often said, the Iraq war and your opposition to it was a sign of your good judgment.	0
In 2008, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer, talking about President George W. Bush's conduct of the war, you said you were surprised that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi didn't try to impeach him.	0
"You said, quote: ""Which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing."""	0
"When you were asked what you meant by that and you said: ""For the war, for the war, he lied, he got us into the war with lies."""	0
Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached?	0
First of all, I have to say, as a businessman, I get along with everybody.	0
I have business all over the world.	0
[ booing ]	0
I know so many of the people in the audience.	0
And by the way, I'm a self-funder.	0
I don't have — I have my wife and I have my son.	0
That's all I have.	0
I don't have this.	0
[ applause ]	0
So let me just tell you, I get along with everybody, which is my obligation to my company, to myself, et cetera.	0
Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake.	0
All right?	0
Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took — it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced for president, it took him five days.	0
He went back, it was a mistake, it wasn't a mistake.	0
"It took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, ""It was a mistake."""	0
The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, we don't even have it.	0
Iran has taken over Iraq, with the second-largest oil reserves in the world.	0
Obviously, it was a mistake.	0
So...	0
George Bush made a mistake.	0
We can make mistakes.	0
But that one was a beauty.	0
We should have never been in Iraq.	0
We have destabilized the Middle East.	0
But so I'm going to — so you still think he should be impeached?	0
I think it's my turn, isn't it?	0
You do whatever you want.	0
You call it whatever you want.	0
I want to tell you.	0
They lied.	0
They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none.	0
And they knew there were none.	0
There were no weapons of mass destruction.	0
[ booing ]	0
All right.	0
O.K.	0
All right.	0
Governor Bush — when a member on the stage's brother gets attacked...	0
I've got about five or six...	0
... the brother gets to respond.	0
Do I get to do it five or six times or just once, responding to that?	0
I'm being nice.	0
So here's the deal.	0
I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had.	0
[ applause ]	0
And, frankly, I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me.	0
It's blood sport for him.	0
He enjoys it.	0
And I'm glad he's happy about it.	0
But I am sick and tired...	0
He spent $22 million in...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I am sick and tired of him going after my family.	0
My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind.	0
[ applause ]	0
And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe.	0
And I'm proud of what he did.	0
[ applause ]	0
And he has had the gall to go after my brother.	0
The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign, remember that.	0
[ booing ]	0
He has had the gall to go after my mother.	0
Hold on.	0
Let me finish.	0
He has had the gall to go after my mother.	0
That's not keeping us safe.	0
Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago, looked up, and I saw my mom.	0
My mom is the strongest woman I know.	0
She should be running.	0
This is not about my family or his family.	0
This is about the South Carolina families that need someone to be a commander in chief that can lead.	0
I'm that person.	0
Governor Kasich, would you weigh in on...	0
[ applause ]	0
...Governor Kasich, please weigh in.	0
I've got to tell you, this is just crazy, huh?	0
[ laughter ]	0
This is just nuts, O.K.?	0
Jeez, oh, man.	0
I'm sorry, John.	0
Why is it nuts?	0
Talk about it.	0
Give us your sense of...	0
Oh, well, listen, I think being in Iraq, look, we thought there were weapons of mass destruction.	0
Colin Powell, who is one of the most distinguished generals in modern time, said there were weapons there.	0
[ applause ]	0
But, but, the fact is we got ourselves in the middle of a civil war.	0
The Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, never gotten along.	0
In fact, that country was drawn — the borders of that country were drawn after World War I by Westerners that didn't understand what was happening there.	0
The tragedy of it is that we're still embroiled.	0
And, frankly, if there weren't weapons of mass destruction, we should never have gone.	0
I don't believe the United States should involve itself in civil wars.	0
Civil wars are not in our direct interest, and if you — and look, I served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 by Secretary Rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced.	0
The fact is, is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest.	0
We should not be policemen of the world, but when we go, we mean business.	0
We'll do our job.	0
We'll tell our soldiers, our people in the service, take care of your job and then come home once we've accomplished our goals.	0
That's what we need to do.	0
Thirty seconds, Senator Rubio.	0
I just want to say, at least on behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore.	0
[ applause ]	0
And you can — I think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things, but he kept us safe.	0
And not only did he keep us safe, but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was in violation of U.N. resolutions, in open violation, and the world wouldn't do anything about it, and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.	0
And again, he kept us safe, and I am forever grateful to what he did for this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center — the World — excuse me.	0
I lost hundreds of friends.	0
The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush.	0
He kept us safe?	0
That is not safe.	0
That is not safe, Marco.	0
That is not safe.	0
The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn't kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him.	0
[ applause ]	0
And George Bush — by the way, George Bush had the chance, also, and he didn't listen to the advice of his C.I.A.	0
All right, Dr. Carson, we have a cleansing...	0
Can I just...	0
We have a cleansing...	0
I'm not going to invite Donald Trump to the rally in Charleston on Monday afternoon when my brother is coming to speak.	0
I don't want to go.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I'm rescinding the invitation.	0
I thought you might want to come, but I guess not.	0
All right.	0
Well, Dr. Carson, I have got a question now for you.	0
A moment of pause here.	0
"You have said, Dr. Carson, that — referring to yourself, that people bought into the idea that, quote, ""A nice person can't be tough on terrorists."""	0
You have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military, which could lead to more civilian casualties.	0
So, explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against ISIS?	0
Well, first of all, let me just address the Iraq question.	0
You know, I was not particularly in favor of us going to war in Iraq, primarily because I have studied, you know, the Middle East, recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years.	0
And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators, unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them, you're going to have chaos.	0
Now, fortunately, we were able to stabilize the situation, and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, having said that, in terms of the rules of engagement, I was talking about, you know, Obama has said, you know, we shouldn't bomb tankers, you know, coming out of refineries because there may be people in there, or because the environment may be hurt.	0
You know, that's just asinine thinking.	0
And the fact of the matter is...	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, we — obviously, you're not going to accomplish all of your goals without some collateral damage.	0
You have to be able to assess what is acceptable and what is not.	0
All right, thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
We're going to have to take a commercial break here.	0
Thank you to all the candidates.	0
We'll be right back with CBS News's 2016 debate in Greenville, South Carolina.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
We're back with the Republicans who could be president.	0
The topic now is money and how the candidates would spend it.	0
We'll turn the questioning over to Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal and Major Garrett of CBS News.	0
Kim?	0
Mr. Trump.	0
Yes.	0
You have made a lot of promises and you have also — you're the only candidate who has said he would not touch entitlements.	0
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that your ideas would cost an additional $12 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 10 years and that we would have to have annual economic growth of anywhere from 7.7 percent to 9 percent annually to pay for them.	0
Are you proposing more than you can actually deliver, at least not without big deficits?	0
First of all, the — when you say I'm the only candidate, if you listen to the Democrats, they want to do many things to Social Security, and I want to do them on its own merit.	0
You listen to them, what they want to do to Social Security, none of these folks are getting elected, O.K., whether they can do it or not.	0
I'm going to save Social Security.	0
I'm going to bring jobs back from China.	0
I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan, where they're all — every country throughout the world — now Vietnam, that's the new one.	0
They are taking our jobs.	0
They are taking our wealth.	0
They are taking our base.	0
And you and I have had this discussion.	0
We're going to make our economy strong again.	0
I'm lowering taxes.	0
We have $2.5 trillion offshore.	0
We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5, they have no idea what they're doing or saying, as they've proven very well.	0
We're going to bring that money back.	0
You take a look at what happened just this week.	0
China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange, China, a Chinese company.	0
Carrier is moving to Mexico, air conditioning company.	0
Not only the ones I talk about all the time, Nabisco and Ford and — they're all moving out.	0
We have an economy that last quarter, G.D.P.	0
didn't grow.	0
It was flat.	0
We have to make our economy grow again.	0
We're dying.	0
This country is dying.	0
And our workers are losing their jobs, and you're going...	0
But in terms of...	0
I'm the only one who is going to save Social Security, believe me.	0
O.K.	0
But how would you actually do that?	0
Can I ask you?	0
Because right now, Social Security and Medicare...	0
Because you have tremendous waste.	0
I'll tell you...	0
They take up two-thirds of the federal budget, and they're growing.	0
You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse.	0
That we're taking care of.	0
That we're taking care of.	0
It's tremendous.	0
We have in Social Security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old.	0
Now, you know they don't exist.	0
They don't exist.	0
There's tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and we're going to get it.	0
But we're not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they're supposed to get less.	0
We're bringing our jobs back.	0
We're going to make our economy great again.	0
Senator Cruz.	0
[ applause ]	0
John mentioned this is about dollars and incentives.	0
We also want to talk about economic growth engagements.	0
"You have proposed a consumption tax, you called it the ""back tax."""	0
"Some analysts compare it more to an attributed ""value-added tax."""	0
"From the perspective from economic growth in building wages, how does that work, and how would you address those longstanding conservative concerns that something approaching the ""value-added tax"" would be used to constantly increase those rates to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation, not of growth?"	0
Well, let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands — everyone understands that how — that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy, and we've got to bring jobs back.	0
We've got to get people back to work.	0
We've got to get wages going up again.	0
We've got to get people moving from part-time work to full-time work.	0
We all agree on that, but it's not going to be solved with magic pixie dust.	0
"It's just going to be solved by declaring into the air, ""Let there be jobs."""	0
We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.	0
Now, where do you get economic growth?	0
If you look at cause and effect over our nation's history, every time we lessen the burden of Washington on small-business owners, on job creators, we see incredible economic growth.	0
You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.	0
My tax plan — typical family of four, first $36,000 you earn, you pay nothing in taxes — no income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.	0
Above 10 percent, everyone pays the same simple, flat 10 percent income rate.	0
It's flat and fair.	0
You can fill out your taxes on a postcard, and we abolish the I.R.S.	0
If you want to see the postcard, I've got it on my website.	0
Now, the question — conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time, but especially on this consumption value-added tax system.	0
In Europe, where it exists, it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending, and that's why conservatives have long resisted it.	0
Why and what would you do as president to make sure that doesn't happen?	0
Now, Major, the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT.	0
A VAT in Europe is a sales tax.	0
The business flat tax is not a sales tax, it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business.	0
One of the things that's critical is we're doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax, with abolishing the Obamacare taxes, with abolishing the payroll taxes, which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans, and with abolishing the death tax, which is cruel and unfair.	0
And you asked about economic growth — the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone's income by double digits.	0
That's how you turn the country around, not just hoping and praying for it, but implementing policies that work.	0
O.K., I have a question, a related tax question.	0
Senator Rubio, you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates, 35 percent.	0
"Some economists say, ""It would limit its potential to boost economic growth."""	0
You do that so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the Child Tax Credit.	0
Normally, it's liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy.	0
Why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other side's approach?	0
Well, because I'm influencing social policy — this is their money.	0
This is the money of parents.	0
You don't earn the tax credit unless you're working.	0
That's your money, it doesn't belong to government.	0
Here's what I don't understand.	0
If a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment, they get to write off their taxes.	0
But if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children, they don't?	0
This makes no sense.	0
Parenting is the most important job any of us will ever have.	0
Family formation is the most important thing in society.	0
So what my tax plan does, is it does create, especially for working families, an additional Child Tax Credit.	0
So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the government's money, to invest in their children to go to school, to go to a private school, to buy a new backpack.	0
Let me tell you, if you're a parent that's struggling, then you know that $50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids.	0
I'm going to have a tax plan that is pro-family, because the family is the most important institution in society.	0
You cannot have a strong country without strong families.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, this on is on size of government.	0
In 2013, you pushed through a Medicaid reform in your state over the rejections of many of the Republicans in your state.	0
Total enrollment and overall cost of program have gone well beyond what anyone had expected, including yourself.	0
How can you argue that this overall growth fits in with conservative ambition to significantly cut back on the size of federal welfare programs?	0
Yeah.	0
Well, first of all, those numbers, incorrect.	0
We are — our Medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates, and our Medicaid program in the second year grew at 2.5 percent.	0
And Kimberley, let me tell you, when we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill, then they don't live under a bridge or live in a prison, where they cost $22,500 a year.	0
When we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons, we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons, and we save $22,500 a year.	0
Guess what else?	0
They get their lives back.	0
And the working poor, they're now getting health care.	0
And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses, particularly cancer.	0
So, what I would tell you is, we've gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus.	0
We've cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion.	0
We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private-sector jobs since I've been governor.	0
Our credit is strong.	0
Our pensions are strong.	0
And frankly, we leave no one behind.	0
Economic growth is not an end unto itself.	0
We want everyone to rise, and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get.	0
And that is exactly the program we're driving in Ohio.	0
And, boy, people ought to look at Ohio, because it has got a good formula.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush, a question for you — but if you want to jump in, please.	0
I'd like — can I — can I...	0
Jump in, and then I've got a question for you.	0
Look, I admire the fact that Governor Kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health.	0
I think that's a high priority all across this country, but expanding Obamacare is what we're talking about, and Obamacare's expansion, even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it, is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren.	0
We should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different.	0
[ applause ]	0
When I was — as a private citizen, Florida was confronted with the choice.	0
The governor was supportive of doing what John did.	0
So was the Florida Senate.	0
A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion.	0
I did, and it wasn't expanded there, just as it wasn't expanded in South Carolina under Governor Haley.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Real quickly, jump in, because I have got a question for Governor Bush, but jump in.	0
Yeah, let me say a couple of things.	0
First of all, when Jeb was governor, his first four years as governor, he expand — his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine.	0
O.K.?	0
It's just a fact.	0
Now, with Obamacare, I've not only sued the administration, I did not set up an exchange.	0
And he knows that I'm not for Obamacare, never have been.	0
But here's what's interesting about Medicaid.	0
You know who expanded Medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job?	0
President Ronald Reagan.	0
Now, the fact of the matter is, we expanded to get people on their feet, and once they're on their feet, we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation.	0
Understood, Governor Kasich.	0
That's what we're doing in our state.	0
South Carolina — South Carolinians need to know this, because the Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank him right at the bottom.	0
Yeah, Governor Bush, fine.	0
And Governor Haley is ranked at the top.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Let me get in a question from...	0
No.	0
He mentioned my name.	0
I understand, I understand.	0
Let me finish, though.	0
No, no, no — hey, wait, wait, wait.	0
Just hold, Major, hold, Major.	0
Hold on, Major.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
South Carolinians want to make that, they elect the most conservative governor or candidate that can win.	0
Let me — let's tell you...	0
I have a question on economic growth, Governor Bush.	0
[ applause ]	0
Major — Major, we can't — we've got to — look, I have got to correct the record.	0
And the fact of the matter is, we went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus.	0
We're up 400,000 jobs.	0
Our credit is rock solid.	0
And I don't know...	0
A	0
[ inaudible ]	0
, Governor.	0
Look, the bottom line is the people of this — of this country and this state want to see everybody rise, and they want to see unity, and I don't want to get into all this fighting tonight, because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning.	0
I know, understood.	0
Governor Bush.	0
And I'm going to stay positive about what I want to do from the...	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush, from the perspective, economic growth — viewed from this perspective of economic growth, you have proposed a tax on hedge fund managers.	0
The Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative tax group you're probably aware of, has said no Republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains.	0
And many conservatives wonder if this proposal of yours would undermine not only that philosophy, but undercut your projection of 4 percent economic growth annually under your presidency?	0
Of course not.	0
It won't have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income.	0
In fact, it's not just hedge fund people, but people that are doing — they're in the business of investing other people's money, getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate.	0
They should be paying ordinary income.	0
That's their business.	0
They're grateful to be able to make a lot of money, I'm sure.	0
And what we do is lower the rates.	0
It's not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are, right now, getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn, pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room.	0
That's not a problem at all.	0
What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates, to shift power away from Washington, D.C. That's what I did as governor of the state of Florida, $19 billion dollars of tax cuts, and it stimulated seven out of the eight years.	0
Florida led the nation in job growth.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, before we go to break, could you give us your sense of this conversation about either Medicaid or economic growth through taxation?	0
Well, first of all, let me just mention on the tax issue.	0
Bencarson.com, go read about it, because my tax plan has been praised by Cato, by Wall Street Journal.	0
Forbes said it is the best, the most pro-growth tax plan, and it's based on real fairness for everybody.	0
Starts at the 150 percent poverty level, but even the people below that have to pay something, because everybody has to have skin in the game, and the millions of people can't, you know, talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game.	0
And it deals with corporate tax rate, and makes it the same as everybody else...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...everybody pays exactly the same.	0
Doctor...	0
... And, as far as Medicare and Medicaid, my main goal is to get rid of Obamacare and put the care back in the hands of	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...	0
... Dr. Carson...	0
... Dr. Carson, I'm sorry, we have to go to a commercial.	0
The free market wants what it wants.	0
Back soon with the 2016 Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back.	0
We'll begin the second half of the debate with one of the hottest issues in the Republican campaign, immigration.	0
But before I turn it back to Major Garrett and Kim Strassel, I have one question for Mr. Trump.	0
"Mr. Trump, in the Republican National Committee's Spanish-language response to the State of the Union, Congressman Diaz-Balart said, quote, ""It's essential that we find a legislative solution,"" talking about immigration, ""to offer a permanent and humane solution to those who live in the shadows."	0
"What does that mean to you, ""a humane solution to those who live in the shadows""?"	0
I want everybody taken care of, but we have to take care of our people in this country.	0
We're not taking care of our people.	0
We have no border.	0
We have no control.	0
People are flooding across.	0
We can't have it.	0
We either have a border, and I'm very strongly — I'm not proposing.	0
I will build a wall.	0
I will build a wall.	0
Remember this, the wall will be paid for by Mexico.	0
We are not being treated right.	0
[ applause ]	0
We are not being treated properly.	0
If we don't have borders, if we don't have strength, we don't have a country.	0
People are flowing across.	0
We have to take care of our people.	0
Believe me.	0
Senator Rubio...	0
[ applause ]	0
For the purposes of the lines — lines you would draw legislatively as a president on immigration reform, define amnesty.	0
Well, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that — I've never supported that.	0
I do not support that.	0
I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws.	0
What I think is clear about this issue to begin with is we're not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first, illegal immigration is brought under control.	0
You go back to 1986, when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border.	0
It didn't happen, and as a result, people have lost trust in the federal government.	0
It is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law, but actually prove to people that it's working.	0
They want to see the wall built.	0
They want to see the additional border agents.	0
They want to see E-Verify.	0
They want to see an entry-exit tracking system.	0
Forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas.	0
And only after all of that is in place, then we'll see what the American people are willing to support on this issue.	0
I think the American people will be very reasonable, but responsible, about how you handle someone who has been here a long time, who can pass a background check, who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit.	0
But you can't do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz.	0
Senator Cruz, you have promised to deport illegal aliens.	0
You have also promised to reverse President Obama's executive action that gives temporary amnesty to illegals brought here by their parent as children.	0
As president, you would have the names and addresses of the some 800,000 of those that have registered under that action.	0
Now, you have said that in this country, we shouldn't go door to door, look for illegals, but in this case you would have a list.	0
Would you use it?	0
Well, you know, your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage.	0
You know, in a Republican primary, everyone talks tough on immigration.	0
Everyone is against illegal immigration in a Republican primary.	0
But as voters, we've been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they don't walk the walk.	0
There are sharp differences on amnesty.	0
If you look at the folks on this stage, when Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and establishment Republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan, I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan.	0
[ applause ]	0
So would you — would you use the addresses?	0
Now, that moment...	0
Would you pick them up?	0
"That moment was what Reagan would call ""a time for choosing."""	0
When it comes to deciding which side of the line you're on, the Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan...	0
[ booing ]	0
...apparently supported by the donor class, which is why Washington supported it.	0
The Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan passed the Senate, and it was on the verge of passing the House.	0
House leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the Democrats overruling most of the Republicans.	0
And the question for anyone on illegal immigration is, where were you in that fight?	0
Where did you stand?	0
You are right.	0
There is a difference between Senator Rubio and me on this question.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Rubio, your reply.	0
We're going to have to do this again, O.K.?	0
When that issue was being debated, Ted Cruz, at a committee hearing, very passionately said, I want immigration reform to pass, I want people to be able to come out of the shadows.	0
And he proposed an amendment that would legalized people here.	0
Not only that, he proposed doubling the number of green cards.	0
He proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers.	0
Now his position is different.	0
Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things.	0
So he either wasn't telling the truth then or he isn't telling the truth now, but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true.	0
[ applause ]	0
Major, I get a response to that.	0
Very quickly, Senator Cruz.	0
All right.	0
Senator Cruz.	0
Your response, Senator Cruz.	0
You know, the lines are very, very clear.	0
Marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally.	0
I oppose citizenship.	0
Marco stood on the debate stage and said that.	0
But I would note not only that — Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty.	0
In the state of Florida, as speaker of the house, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.	0
In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.	0
I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.	0
[ applause and booing ]	0
And on the question...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Well, first of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision, because he doesn't speak Spanish.	0
And second of all, the other point that I would make...	0
[ in Spanish ]	0
.	0
Look, this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies.	0
He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa.	0
[ applause ]	0
He lies about Planned Parenthood.	0
He lies about marriage.	0
He's lying about all sorts of things.	0
And now he makes things up.	0
The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it.	0
And they see the truth behind all these issues.	0
And here is the truth, Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country...	0
That is simply...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... and only now does he say...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
That is absolutely false.	0
What he said is knowingly false.	0
And I would note, if you want to assess — if you want to assess...	0
Well, we'll put on our website, marcorubio.com.	0
We're going to...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... who is telling the truth...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
If you want to assess who is telling the truth...	0
[ applause ]	0
...then you should look to Jeff Sessions, who said, without Ted Cruz the Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill would have passed, and Ted was responsible.	0
You should look to Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, that said...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Governor Bush, I want to bring this out to a little wider philosophical aspect, if you will.	0
Thank you.	0
"You have said illegal immigrants, quote, ""broke the law, but it's not a felony,"" still quoting you, ""it's an act of love, it's an act of commitment to your family."""	0
Mr. Trump has, as you are well aware, denounced that statement over and over.	0
Do you still believe it?	0
What does that mean to you?	0
And how does that inform your approach to immigration reform?	0
Great question.	0
I feel like I have to get into my inner Chris Christie, and point out that the reason why I should be president is listening to two senators talk about arcane amendments to bills that didn't pass.	0
[ applause ]	0
This is — this is the problem.	0
We need a leader to fix this problem.	0
And I have a detailed plan to do just that, including controlling the border, dealing with the visa over-stayers, making sure that we have a path to legal status, not to citizenship, for those that come out from the shadows and pay a fine, learn English, don't commit crimes, work and pay taxes.	0
That is the better approach.	0
Fundamentally, do you believe this rhetoric is insufficiently compassionate to this issue?	0
The great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice.	0
They want to come to provide for their families.	0
That doesn't mean it's right.	0
That doesn't mean it's right.	0
We should pick who comes to our country.	0
We should control our border.	0
Coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally.	0
But the motivation, they're not all rapists, as you-know-who said.	0
They're not that.	0
These are people that are coming to provide for their families.	0
And we should show a little more respect for the fact that they're struggling.	0
It doesn't mean we shouldn't be controlling the border.	0
That's exactly what we should be doing.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
Look...	0
[ applause ]	0
...When I announced that I was running for president on June 16th, illegal immigration wasn't even a subject.	0
If I didn't bring it up, we wouldn't even be talking.	0
Now, I don't often agree with Marco, and I don't often agree with Ted, but I can in this case.	0
The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush.	0
They come out of an act of love, whether you like it or not.	0
He is so weak on illegal immigration it's laughable, and everybody knows it.	0
...	0
So, you know...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...This is the standard operating procedure, to disparage me.	0
That's fine...	0
...	0
Spend a little more money on the commercials...	0
...	0
But, if you want to talk about weakness, you want to talk about weakness?	0
It's weak to disparage women.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
I don't know what you're talking about.	0
It's weak to denigrate the disabled.	0
And,it's really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a...	0
...	0
I never called him — I don't call him..	0
... That is outrageous.	0
The guy's an American hero.	0
[ applause ]	0
He also said about language...	0
...	0
The simple fact is I've also laid out my plans on	0
[ inaudible ]	0
immigration...	0
...	0
Language.	0
Two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody, and that's fine.	0
Nobody reports that.	0
He gets up and says that, and then he tells me, oh, my language was a little bit rough...	0
... O.K....	0
... My language.	0
Give me a break...	0
...	0
Governor Kasich, here in South Carolina earlier this week, you said the idea, the concept of deporting 11 million undocumented workers...	0
[	0
inaudible ] Just, for the record	0
[ inaudible ]	0
make sure my mother's listening, if she's watching the debate.	0
I didn't say that I was going to moon somebody...	1
... You did say it, you did say it.	0
Been reported in 10 different news...	0
... We will leave the moon metaphors to be adjudicated later, I assure you.	0
Governor Kasich, you said earlier this week in South Carolina, the concept, the idea of deporting 11 million undocumented workers in this country is nuts.	0
Why is it you are so opposed to that idea?	0
Senator Cruz has said it's a simple application of existing law.	0
The application of that is not inhumane, it is just.	0
Why do you disagree?	0
Before I get to that, this is the ninth or 10th debate.	0
What I've been watching here, this back and forth, and these attacks, some of them are personal.	0
I think we're fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don't stop this.	0
[ applause ]	0
I mean, the fact is — you know what?	0
I would suggest, why don't we take off all the negative ads and all the negative comments down from television and let us just talk about what we're for, and let's sell that, and the Republican Party will be stronger as a result...	0
... What are you for on immigration?	0
... [	0
off mike ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
First of all, I'm for sealing the border, O.K.?	0
And then I'm for a guest worker program.	0
People can come in, work and go back home.	0
We haven't closed the border because special interests, I believe, blocked it.	0
Then, we have 11 and a half million people here.	0
If they have not committed a crime since they've been here, make them pay a fine and some back taxes, and give them a path to legalization, never to citizenship.	0
It is not going to happen that we're going to run around and try to drag 11 and a half million people out of their homes.	0
I'll tell you this.	0
Within the first hundred days, I will send a plan like this to the Congress of the United States, and if I'm president, I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts right now, it will pass.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
That is a reasonable proposal that the people of this country, in my judgment, will support, and so will the bulk of the Congress of the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
Moving subjects.	0
Dr. Carson, this week Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $3.2 billion fine to state and federal authorities for contributing to the mortgage crisis.	0
You have a lot of Democrats out saying that we should be jailing more executives, so two questions.	0
Should financial executives be held legally responsible for financial crisis, and do you think fines like these are an effective way to deter companies from future behavior like that?	0
Well, first of all, please go to my website, bencarson.com, and read my immigration policy, O.K.?	0
Because it actually makes sense.	0
Now, the — as far as these fines are concerned, you know?	0
Here's the big problem.	0
We've got all these government regulators, and all they're doing is running around looking for people to fine.	0
And we've got 645 different federal agencies and sub-agencies.	0
Way, way too many, and they don't have anything else to do.	0
I think what we really need to do is start trimming the regulatory agencies rather than going after the people who are trying to increase the viability, economic viability of our society.	0
Now, that doesn't mean there aren't some people out there who are doing bad things.	0
But I'm not sure that the way to solve that problem is by increasing all the regulatory burden.	0
You know, when you consider how much regulations cost us each year, you know?	0
$2 trillion dollars per family, $24,000 per family, that happens to be the same level as the poverty level...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
... for a family of four.	0
If you want to get rid of poverty, get rid of all the regulations.	0
Senator Cruz, I have a question for you.	0
Speaker Paul Ryan has made a big commitment to trying to lift the 50 million poor out of poverty.	0
"Arthur Brooks, who is the president of the American Enterprise Institute, says, quote, ""If we are not warriors for the poor every day, free enterprise has no matter."""	0
How you have been, in your campaign, a warrior for the poor?	0
I think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the Obama economy had been the most vulnerable.	0
It's been young people.	0
It's been Hispanics.	0
It's been African-Americans.	0
It's been single moms.	0
We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today in any year since 1977.	0
And the sad reality is big government, massive taxes, massive regulation, doesn't work.	0
What we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth, let — small businesses are the heart of the economy.	0
Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses.	0
If we want to lift people out of poverty — you know, I think of these issues from the perspective of my dad.	0
My dad fled Cuba in 1957.	0
He was just 18.	0
He couldn't speak English.	0
He had nothing.	0
He had $100 in his underwear.	0
And he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school.	0
Today, my dad is a pastor.	0
He travels the country preaching the gospel.	0
Now, I think about all of these issues.	0
How would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes?	0
If we had Obamacare in place right now, the odds are very high my father would have been laid off, because it's teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off.	0
If he didn't get laid off, the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28, 29 hours a week.	0
We need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs, and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work.	0
Mr. Trump — Mr. Trump.	0
[ applause ]	0
I was with you in Pendleton, South Carolina, earlier this week at the Rodeo Arena.	0
It was a bit chilly there.	0
You promised the crowd, and they rose to their feet, that if Ford or a company like were to move a factory to Mexico, you would try to stop it or threaten them with a 35 percent tax or tariff on every car sold.	0
Or a tax.	0
Right.	0
So my question is, based on your understanding of the presidency, where do you derive that power?	0
Would you need the consent of Congress to go along?	0
And do you see the presidency as a perch from which you can cajole and/or threaten private industry to do something you think is better for the U.S. economy?	0
I would build consensus with Congress, and Congress would agree with me.	0
I'll give you an example, because I don't like the idea of using executive orders like our president.	0
It is a disaster what he's doing.	0
I would build consensus, but consensus means you have to work hard.	0
You have to cajole.	0
You have to get them into the Oval Office and get them all together, and you have to make deals.	0
Let me just tell you, I mentioned before, China — big Chinese company bought the Chicago Exchange.	0
Kerry is moving — and if you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, O.K.	0
?	0
Well, I'll tell you what.	0
I would go right now to Carrier and I would say I am going to work awfully hard.	0
You're going to make air conditioners now in Mexico.	0
You're going to get all of these 1,400 people that are being laid off — they're laid off.	0
They were crying.	0
They were — it was a very sad situation.	0
You're going to go to Mexico.	0
You're going to make air conditioners in Mexico, you're going to put them across our border with no tax.	0
I'm going to tell them right now, I am going to get consensus from Congress and we're going to tax you when those air conditioners come.	0
So stay where you are or build in the United States, because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Mr. Trump, thank you so much.	0
We're going to take a break for a moment.	0
We'll be back in a moment with the CBS News Republican debate.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
We're back now from Greenville, South Carolina, with the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.	0
Mr. Trump, I have a question for you.	0
Presidents have to, on the one hand, be firm, but also be flexible.	0
You have been flexible and changed your opinion on a number of things, from abortion to Hillary Clinton.	0
But you have said, rightly, that it's just like Ronald Reagan, who changed his mind on things.	0
But at the same time, you're criticizing Senator Cruz for what you say is a change on immigration.	0
He disputes that, of course.	0
So, why is your change of opinion make you like Reagan, and when he changes his opinion, it's a huge character flaw?	0
[ laughter ]	0
John, in life you have flexibility.	0
You do have flexibility.	0
When you're fighting wars, you're going one way, you have a plan.	0
It's a beautiful plan.	0
It can't lose.	0
The enemy makes a change, and all of a sudden you have to change.	0
You have to have flexibility.	0
In Ronald Reagan, though, in terms of what we're talking about, was the great example.	0
He was a somewhat liberal Democrat who became a somewhat, pretty strong conservative.	0
He became — most importantly, he became a great president.	0
He made many of the changes that I've made — I mean, I've seen as I grew up, I've seen, and as I get older and wiser, and I feel that I am a conservative.	0
Now, I also feel I'm a common-sense conservative, because some of the views I don't agree with.	0
And I think a lot of people agree with me, obviously, based on what's happening.	0
Which conservative idea don't you agree with?	0
Well, I think these people always hit me with eminent domain, and frankly, I'm not in love with eminent domain.	0
But eminent domain is something you need very strongly.	0
"When Jeb had said, ""You used eminent domain privately for a parking lot."""	0
It wasn't for a parking lot.	0
The state of New Jersey — too bad Chris Christie is not here, he could tell you — the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people.	0
I mean, it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development.	0
Now, just so you understand, I got hit very hard.	0
It's private, it's private eminent domain.	0
You understand that they took over a stadium in Texas, and they used private eminent domain, but he just found that out after he made the charge.	0
All right.	0
"Governor Bush, I think by ""they,"" he is referring to your brother, these on the hook for your brother."	0
Yeah.	0
Well, Jeb wouldn't have known about it.	0
So, there — so, there is all sorts of intrigue about where I disagree with my brother, there would be one right there.	0
You should not use eminent domain for private purposes.	0
A baseball stadium or a parking lot for a limo...	0
[ laughter ]	0
You shouldn't have used it then, Jeb.	0
But that was his brother.	0
It's very different.	0
Transmission lines, pipe lines, bridges and highways.	0
All of that is proper use of imminent domain.	0
Not to take an elderly woman's home to build a parking lot so that high-rollers can come from New York City to build casinos in Atlantic City.	0
Senator Cruz, you were mentioned in the mix here, your response?	0
You know, flexibility is a good thing, but it shouldn't — you shouldn't be flexible on core principles.	0
I like Donald, he is an amazing entertainer, but his policies for most of his life...	0
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.	0
For most of his life, his policies have been very, very liberal.	0
For most of his life, he has described himself as very pro- choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion.	0
Right now, today, as a candidate, he supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.	0
I disagree with him on that.	0
That's a matter of principle, and I'll tell you...	0
You probably are worse than Jeb Bush.	0
You are single biggest liar.	0
This guy's lied — let me just tell you, this guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa, and he just continues.	0
"Today, we had robo-calls saying, ""Donald Trump is not going to run in South Carolina,"" where I'm leading by a lot."	0
I'm not going to vote for Ted Cruz.	0
This is the same thing he did to Ben Carson.	0
This guy will say anything, nasty guy.	0
Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues.	0
Don, I need to go on...	0
He's a nasty guy.	0
"I will say, it is fairly remarkable to see Donald defending Ben after he called, ""pathological,"" and compared him to a child molester."	0
Both of which were offensive and wrong.	0
But let me say this — you notice Donald didn't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.	0
"And Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record, he screams, ""Liar, liar, liar."""	0
You want to go...	0
Where did I support it?	0
Where did I...	0
You want to go...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Again, where did I support it?	0
If you want to watch the video, go to our website at Tedcruz.org.	0
Hey Ted, where I support it?	0
You can see it out of Donald's own mouth.	0
Where did I support?	0
You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood.	0
You went on...	0
That's a lot of lies.	0
"You said, ""Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it."""	0
It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion.	0
So I'll tell you what...	0
Excuse me.	0
Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with women's health.	0
You see, you and I...	0
But not when it comes to abortion.	0
Don, the reasoned principle matters.	0
The reasoned principle matters, sadly was illustrated by the first questions today.	0
The next president is going to appoint one, two, three, four Supreme Court justices.	0
If Donald Trump is president, he will appoint liberals.	0
If Donald Trump is president, your Second Amendment will gone...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Hold on...	0
You know how I know that?	0
Hold on, gentleman, I'm going to turn this car around.	0
Ted Cruz told your brother that he wanted John Roberts to be on the United States Supreme Court.	0
They both pushed him, he twice approved Obamacare.	0
All right, gentlemen.	0
My name was mentioned twice.	0
Well, hold on.	0
We're going to — gentlemen, we're in danger of driving this into the dirt.	0
Senator Rubio, I'd like you to jump in here...	0
He called me a liar.	0
I understand, you're on deck, governor.	0
Also, he talked about one of my heroes, Ronald Reagan.	0
Ronald Reagan was a liberal maybe in the 1950s.	0
He was a conservative reformed governor for eight years before he became president, and no one should suggest he made an evolution for political purposes.	0
He was a conservative, and he didn't tear down people like Donald Trump is.	0
He tore down the Berlin Wall.	0
O.K., governor.	0
He was a great guy.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, 30 seconds on this one.	0
I did not nominate John Roberts.	0
I would not have nominated John Roberts.	0
You pushed him.	0
You pushed him.	0
I supported...	0
You worked with him and you pushed him.	0
Why do you lie?	0
You need to learn to not interrupt people.	0
Why do you lie?	0
Donald, adults learn...	0
You pushed him.	0
Adults learn not to interrupt people.	0
Yeah, yeah, I know, you're an adult.	0
I did not nominate him.	0
I would not have nominated him.	0
I would've nominated my former boss Liberman, who was Justice Scalia's first law clerk.	0
And you know how I know that Donald's Supreme Court justices will be liberals?	0
Because his entire life, he support liberals from Jimmy Carter, to Hillary Clinton, to John Kerry.	0
In 2004, he contributed to John Kerry.	0
Nobody who cares about judges would contribute to John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid.	0
We're going to switch...	0
That's what Donald Trump does.	0
We're going to switch here to Senator Marco Rubio.	0
Senator Marco Rubio, please weigh in.	0
On anything I want?	0
I thought you had a point?	0
Well, let me talk about poverty.	0
I thought you had a point you wanted to make.	0
I do.	0
That was me.	0
I had something important.	0
You're on deck, sir.	0
The issue of poverty is critical, because for me, poverty is the — is — is free enterprise not reaching people.	0
Today, we have antipoverty programs that don't cure poverty.	0
We don't cure poverty in America.	0
Our antipoverty programs have become, in some instances, a way of life, a lifestyle.	0
Now, we do need antipoverty programs, you can't have free enterprise programs without them, but not as a way of life.	0
And so I have a very specific proposal on this and I don't — in 60 seconds, I can't describe it all, but it basically turns the program over to states.	0
It allows states to design innovative programs that cure poverty, because I think Nikki Haley will do a better job curing poverty than Barack Obama.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator, I wanted to ask you, just going back to immigration, in the last debate, you listed your series of accomplishments in the Senate.	0
One thing you left off was — was immigration reform.	0
Is it the case that in your list of accomplishments you can't mention that?	0
Well, no.	0
It's not the case.	0
It didn't pass, and we haven't solved immigration in this country.	0
It's still a problem.	0
It is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago.	0
And it has to be confronted and solved.	0
But the only way forward on this issue — you asked a question about flexibility.	0
Let me tell you about that.	0
One of the things that you need in leadership is the ability to understand that to get things done, you must figure out the way to get it done.	0
You will not pass comprehensive immigration reform.	0
People do not trust the federal government.	0
They want to see the law being enforced.	0
They want to see illegal immigration come under control.	0
They want to see that wall.	0
They want to see E-Verify.	0
They want to see all of these things working, and then they will have a conversation with you about what do you do with people that have been here a long time that are otherwise, you know, not criminals.	0
But they're not going to do it until you first enforce the law.	0
Dr. Carson, I have...	0
[ applause ]	0
...Dr. Carson, I have a question for you.	0
Candidates are...	0
Before you ask the question, can I respond to the — you know, they mentioned my name a couple of times.	0
All right.	0
You have 30 seconds, Doctor.	0
All right.	0
"Well, first of all, you know, so many people have said to me, ""You need to scream and jump and down — jump up and down like everybody else."""	0
Is that really what you want?	0
What we just saw?	0
I don't think so.	0
And you know, I — when I got into this race, I decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs Washington, D.C., and my first inclination was to run away, but I didn't do it because I'm thinking about our children and the fact that we are the United States of America.	0
And anybody up here is going to be much better than what's going to come on the other side.	0
And what happened tonight with — with Justice Scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election, and we cannot be tearing each other down.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, I — let me ask you a different question.	0
When you were — you were the first one, really, to talk about political correctness.	0
Everybody now talks about it, but that was really what sparked your — your rise.	0
Politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make, just always selling happy, nice things.	0
So in the — in the spirit of saying something that might be politically incorrect, tell the voters something that they need to hear but that might be politically incorrect?	0
Well, first of all, I'm not a politician, so I'm never going to become a politician.	0
But here's what — here's what people need to know.	0
People need to know that free college is not — it's a non-starter.	0
You know, you have to look at our economic situation.	0
We're on the verge of economic collapse and, you know, we're — it's not just the $19 trillion, but it's also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.	0
What we need to think about is, what does that do to the average person?	0
When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy, it causes the central bank to keep the — the rates low, and who does does that affect?	0
Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg, that's gone.	0
That part of the American dream is gone.	0
All of these things are disappearing, and Bernie Sanders and people like Hillary Clinton blame it on the rich.	0
They say those evil rich people, if we take their money we can solve the problem.	0
It's not the evil rich people.	0
It's the irresponsible, evil government.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich.	0
Governor Kasich, you've been described as the Democrats' favorite Republican.	0
"You talked about in New Hampshire, Democrats would come up to you and say, ""I hope you win."""	0
Why will that help you win a Republican nomination?	0
You know, John, I think all people are the same.	0
Look, I did 106 town halls, and I've been doing them left and right here in South Carolina.	0
The first thing we have to do is grow the economy, and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs, and the same that we've been able to do in Ohio.	0
You need common-sense regulations so small business can flourish, you need lower taxes both on business and individuals, and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues.	0
And when you have that formula, combined with work force that's trained, you can explode the economy and create many jobs.	0
I have done it twice, and I want to go back to Washington and do it again.	0
John, the thing is, is I think that there are people now, these blue-collar Democrats — my dad was a blue-collar Democrat — the Democratic Party has left them.	0
When they're arguing about being socialists, they've left — they have lost those blue-collar Democrats.	0
And you know what I think they get out of me — is my sense of what they get out of me, and it's embarrassment about campaigns, you brag about yourself.	0
But I think I'm a uniter, I think people sense it.	0
I think they know I have the experience, and that I'm a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise.	0
And I'll tell you, I love these blue-collar Democrats, because they're going to vote for us come next fall, promise you that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, let me ask you a question.	0
Presidents in both parties say that the one thing you need in your administration is somebody who can tell you you're wrong.	0
You don't necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you you're wrong a lot.	0
"Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said, ""Donald Trump, you're wrong,"" and you listened to them?"	0
Well, I would say my wife tells me I'm wrong all the time.	0
And I listen.	0
[ laughter ]	0
About what?	0
Oh, let me just say — look, I am very open — I hired top people.	0
I've had great success.	0
I built a great, great company.	0
I don't need to do this.	0
I'm self-funding.	0
I'm spending a lot of money.	0
I've spent — like in New Hampshire, I spent $3 million.	0
Jeb bush spent $44 million.	0
He came in five, and I came in No.	0
1.	0
That's what the country needs, folks.	0
I spent 3, he spends 42 of their money, of special interest money.	0
And it's just — this is not going to make — excuse me.	0
This is not going to make our country great again.	0
This is not what we need in our country.	0
We need people that know what the hell they're doing.	0
And politicians, they're all talk, they're no action.	0
And that's why people are supporting me.	0
I do listen to people.	0
I hire experts.	0
I hire top, top people.	0
And I do listen.	0
And you know what?	0
Sometimes they're wrong.	0
You have to know what to do, when to do it.	0
But sometimes they're wrong.	0
Let me — something, in talking to voters that they wish somebody would tell you to cut it out is the profanity.	0
What's your reaction to that?	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, I'll tell you — over the years, I've made many speeches.	0
People have asked me, big companies have asked me to make speeches, and friends of mine that run big companies on success.	0
And occasion, in order to sort of really highlight something, I'll use a profanity.	0
One of the profanities that I got credited with using, that I didn't use, was a very bad word, two weeks ago, that I never used.	0
"I said, ""You."""	0
"And everybody said ""Oh, he didn't say anything wrong."""	0
But you bleeped it, so everyone thinks I said the — I didn't say anything.	0
I never said the word.	0
It is very unfair, that criticism.	0
Now, I will say this, with all of that being said, I have said I will not do it at all, because if I say a word that's a little bit off color, a little bit, it ends up being a headline.	0
I will not do it again.	0
I was a very good student at a great school not using — by the way — not using profanity is very easy.	0
All right.	0
O.K.	0
Governor Bush, I'd like to ask you...	0
Yeah, well, I have got to respond to this.	0
Well, can I — how about you respond, and then you can answer the question I'm about to ask you.	0
Sounds like a good plan.	0
It'll be...	0
Or you could ask me two questions, so I could get two minutes instead of one.	0
If we adjudicate this, the night will be over.	0
Governor, in 2012, you said that your father and Ronald Reagan would have a hard time in today's Republican Party, based on their records of trying to find accommodation and finding some degree of common ground.	0
Do you still feel that way?	0
I think the dysfunction in Washington is really dangerous, that's what I think.	0
And we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems, someone who doesn't cut and run; someone who could be a commander in chief to unite our country around common purposes; someone who doesn't disparage people.	0
Someone that doesn't brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great, because he could use the legal system.	0
Someone...	0
That's not — let me respond.	0
That's another lie.	0
I never went bankrupt!	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Hold on, Mr. Trump.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
No, but it's another lie.	0
Hold on, Mr. Trump.	0
No, but it's another lie.	0
This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.	0
Just a lie.	0
We need someone with a proven record to be able to forge consensus to solve problems.	0
And right now, both Republicans and Democrats in Washington don't get it.	0
People are struggling — 63 percent of Americans can't make a $500 car payment.	0
Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.	0
And we need someone has a proven record of growing the economy, reforming the things that are broken.	0
And I'm that person.	0
O.K., Mr. Trump, your response.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me just tell you.	0
Jeb goes around saying, just like the biggest business leaders in this country, I've used the laws of the land to chapter — I bought a company, I threw it immediately into a chapter, I made a great deal.	0
I uses the laws to my benefit, because I run a company.	0
Yeah...	0
Excuse me, Jeb!	0
Yeah.	0
I never went bankrupt, never.	0
Now — but you don't want to say that.	0
Now, let me just say, I've used it, just like the biggest leaders in the country.	0
Let me tell you something — Florida.	0
Florida, he put so much debt on Florida.	0
You know, we keep saying he's a wonderful governor, wonderful governor.	0
He put so much debt on Florida, and he increased spending so much that as soon as he got out of office, Florida crashed.	0
I happened to be there.	0
It's my second home.	0
Florida crashed.	0
He didn't do a good job as governor.	0
Here we go.	0
And you haven't — excuse me, you haven't heard that.	0
You listen to the good record in Florida.	0
You take a look at what happened, as soon as that year ended he got out, Florida crashed.	0
Too much debt.	0
He loaded it up with debt, and his spending went through the roof.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
By the way...	0
The bells are ringing, sir.	0
... he was not a good governor.	0
Here's the record.	0
Here's the record.	0
We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years.	0
When I left there was $9 billion of reserves, 35 percent of general revenue.	0
No state came close to that.	0
Take a look at your numbers.	0
When I — during my time, we were one of the two states to go to AAA bond rating.	0
We didn't go bankrupt like Trump did and call it success when people are laid off, when vendors don't get paid.	0
That's not success.	0
What we did was create an environment where people had a chance to have income.	0
Personal income during my time went up by 4.4 percent.	0
Florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office.	0
The government grew by...	0
Went right down because of what he did to it.	0
... half of that.	0
All right.	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Rubio, I want to ask you a 30-second question, no president can...	0
Thirty seconds.	0
No — well, I'll ask the question, you do what you want.	0
I speak fast.	0
[ laughter ]	0
No president can know everything, right?	0
So a smart leader knows how to ask questions.	0
So if you could talk to any previous president, what's the smart question you would ask about that job that you would want to know?	0
Well, I think one of the presidents — well, the president I grew up under was Ronald Reagan.	0
And Reagan had a vision for America's future.	0
And if you think about what Ronald Reagan inherited, it's not unlike what the next president is going to inherit.	0
This is the worst president we've had in 35 years, 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter.	0
That's what Ronald Reagan inherited.	0
And I think the question you would ask is, how did you inspire again the American people to believe in the future?	0
How did you — what did it take to ensure that the American people, despite all of the difficulties of the time — you know, you look back at that time, the American military was in decline.	0
Our standing in the world was in decline.	0
We had hostages being held in Iran.	0
Our economy was in bad shape.	0
The American people were scared about the future.	0
They were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit.	0
And yet somehow Ronald Reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism.	0
And he turned America around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership.	0
I wish Ronald Reagan was still around.	0
This country needs someone just like that.	0
And if our next president is even half the president Ronald Reagan was, America is going to be greater than it has ever been.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
That's going to have to be it there, Senator Rubio.	0
We have got to go to a break.	0
We will be right back with the CBS News Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Time now for closing statements.	0
You will each have one minute, and we'll begin with Governor Kasich.	0
Well, I want to thank the people of South Carolina.	0
You've been fantastic.	0
And look, what I want you to know is I'm going to send a lot of power, money and influence back to where we all live.	0
But as I've traveled around South Carolina, I've noticed something.	0
You know, it's that people have a sense that you're not going to wait on a president.	0
You know, when I was a kid, we didn't wait on presidents to come to that little blue-collar town and fix things.	0
You know, the Lord made all of us special.	0
The Lord wants us to be connected.	0
I believe we're part of a very big mosaic.	0
And I'll send the power back.	0
And whoever gets elected president here, hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.	0
But the spirit of the America rests in all of us.	0
It's in our guts.	0
It's taking care of our children.	0
It's taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband.	0
It's fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs.	0
You see, I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage, and in America, the spirit of America doesn't come from the top down.	0
The spirit of America rests in us.	0
And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.	0
Thank you all very much.	0
And I hope I can have your vote in South Carolina.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson — Dr. Carson, you're next.	0
This is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents.	0
Some people say it's the new normal, but there's nothing normal about it in an exceptional American.	0
I, like you, am a member of we, the people, and we know that our country is heading off the cliff.	0
Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.	1
We, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina.	0
"If all the people who say, ""I love Ben Carson and his policies, but he can't win,"" vote for me, not only can we win, but we can turn this thing around."	0
You know, we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who we're supposed to pick and how we're supposed to live.	0
We, the people, are the only people who will determine that.	0
And if you elect me as your next president, I promise you that you will get somebody who is accountable to everybody and beholden to no one.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor — Governor Bush.	0
Thank you all very much.	0
The next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge.	0
That's almost certain.	0
It could be a pandemic, a major natural disaster or an attack on our country.	0
The question for South Carolinians and Americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office?	0
Because that's the question.	0
It's not the things we're talking about today.	0
It's the great challenge that may happen.	0
I believe I will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the United States.	0
I will unite this country around common purposes because I did it as governor of the state of Florida.	0
When I was governor, we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months.	0
Our state was on its back.	0
We recovered far faster than what people thought because we led.	0
We want to challenge rather than cutting and running.	0
That's what we need in Washington, D.C. We need someone with a servant's heart that has a backbone, that isn't going to focus on polls and focus groups.	0
The focus will be on the American people to keep them safe and secure.	0
I ask for your vote next Saturday.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, governor.	0
And now, Marco Rubio.	0
Thank you, and thank you for watching tonight.	0
This is a difficult time in our country.	0
Our economy's flat, it's not creating the jobs it once did, and people struggle living paycheck to paycheck.	0
Our culture's in trouble.	0
Wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong.	0
All the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault.	0
And around the world, America's reputation is in decline.	0
Our allies don't trust us, our adversaries don't fear us, Iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video.	0
These are difficult times, but 2016 can be a turning point.	0
That's why I'm running for president, and that's why I'm here today to ask you for your vote.	0
If you elect me president, we are going to re-embrace free enterprise so that everyone can go as far as their talent and their work will take them.	0
"We are going to be a country that says that ""life begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws."""	0
"We're going to be a country that says ""that marriage is between one man and one woman."""	0
"We are going to be a country that says, ""The constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president, they come from our creator."""	0
We are going to be loyal to our allies like Israel, not enemies like Iran.	0
And we will rebuild the U.S. military so no one will there test it.	0
Vote for me.	0
I will unify this party.	0
I will grow it.	0
We will win this election, and we will make the 21st century a new American century.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz?	0
Senator Cruz, your closing statement?	0
South Carolina, you have a critical choice to make.	0
Our country literally hangs in the balance.	0
Do you want another Washington deal maker who will do business as usual, cut deals with the Democrats, grow government, grow debt and give up our fundamental liberties?	0
Or do you want a conservative, a proven conservative that will stand and fight with you each and every day?	0
Listen, repealing Obamacare is not going to be easy.	0
Passing a simple flat tax that abolishes the I.R.S.	0
is not going to be easy, but if we stand with the American people, we can do it.	0
And today, we saw just how great the stakes are.	0
Two branches of government hang in the balance.	0
Not just the presidency but the Supreme Court.	0
If we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidates, the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty — every one of those hangs in the balance.	0
My little girls are here.	0
"I don't want to look my daughters in the eyes and say, ""We lost their liberties."""	0
Who do you know will defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights?	0
And as a commander in chief, who do you know will stand up to our enemies as the clam, steady, deliberate, strength to defeat our enemies, to secure our borders and to keep America safe.	0
Mr. Trump, your closing statements?	0
Thank you.	0
Politicians are all talk, no action.	0
You've seen where they've take you to.	0
We are 19 trillion dollars right now.	0
It's going to be increased with that horrible budget from a month ago that was just approved by politicians.	0
We need a change.	0
We need a very big change.	0
We're going to make our country great again.	0
I say this every night, every day, every afternoon, and it's so true — we don't win anymore.	0
We don't win with health care, we don't win with ISIS and the military, we don't take care of our vets, we don't care of our borders, we don't win.	0
We are going to start winning again.	0
We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and lobbyists that everybody here has contributed to.	0
And you know what, they do exactly what those folks want them to do.	0
We are going to make our country great, and we're going to do the right thing.	0
I'm working for you.	0
I'm not working for anybody else.	0
Thank you very much.	0
We'll be back with a few final thoughts in a moment.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
So that's nine Republican debates knocked down and at least three to go.	0
This Sunday, it may have been Donald Trump's worst week on the campaign trail yet.	0
He defended his campaign manager, who was charged with assaulting a woman reporter.	0
He called for women who have abortions to be punished.	0
There has to be some form of punishment.	0
For the woman?	0
Yeah, there has to be some form.	0
He says he's open to Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons.	0
And now he's slipping in the polls.	0
Is the Donald Trump campaign finally crumbling?	0
Or will he survive, as he's done so many times before?	0
Plus, Hillary Clinton still can't put away Bernie Sanders.	0
And the frustration is beginning to show.	0
I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me.	0
My exclusive interview this morning with Secretary Clinton.	0
Also, with all the talk of a contested convention, what did John Kasich mean by this?	0
Is Mitt running for president?	0
We've been wondering that ourselves.	0
Is it possible that someone not in the race today could be the Republican nominee in July?	0
And joining me for insight and analysis this morning are David Brooks of The New York Times, Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report, Helene Cooper of The New York Times, and political reporter Charles Benson, from our NBC affiliate in Milwaukee.	0
Happy opening day, and welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.	0
From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.	0
Good Sunday morning.	0
And yes, happy opening day again.	0
"How many times have people said, ""Okay, now, Donald Trump is done."	0
"He's through."""	0
And how many times has it turned out to be true?	0
Well, not once.	0
So it's with that big flashing yellow light in mind that we point out that never has Donald Trump had a worse run, or the idea of a Trump collapse look more possible.	0
Just this week, Trump's campaign manager was arrested and charged with battery.	0
Trump withdrew his pledge to back whoever wins the Republican nomination.	0
He argued it might be time to let Japan and South Korea arm themselves with nuclear weapons to reduce America's military burden.	0
He told MSNBC's Chris Matthews that women should be punished for having abortions.	0
By Friday night, Trump had articulated five positions on abortion in just over 48 hours.	0
And wrapping up this terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad week for Trump, he now trails Ted Cruz in a number of polls in Wisconsin, which holds its primary on Tuesday.	0
Trump's serial explanations on abortion this week have been condemned by both Republicans and Democrats, including Hillary Clinton.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
"Donald Trump said, ""Women should be punished for having an abortion."""	0
(BOOS) He then tried to distance himself, once that kind of reaction came out from his outrageous comments.	0
But we all heard them.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Secretary Clinton is having her own problems putting away Senator Bernie Sanders in her primary.	0
I talked to her last night as she was campaigning in Wisconsin in advance of Tuesday's primary.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
I have a question about a new question that you're running in New York State.	0
Let me play it for the viewers and get you to respond on the other side.	0
Here it is.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
When we pull together, we do the biggest things in the world.	0
So when some say we can solve America's problems by building walls, banning people based on their religion, and turning against each other, well, this is New York.	0
And we know better.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Secretary Clinton, is that an ad, have you moved on?	0
Are we going to view this ad as the first one of the general election?	0
It's pretty clear you're targeting Donald Trump.	0
Well, certainly I haven't moved on.	0
I know that I still have work to do to win the nomination, and I'm going to keep reaching out to every voter, everywhere in these remaining contests.	0
But I also think it's important to draw some pretty clear lines between what I think most Americans, and certainly what I know most New Yorkers believe about who we are as a people, what the values of our country are, against some of what we're hearing from the other side.	0
And, you know, it's both Donald Trump, as we are well aware, but also Ted Cruz.	0
I know he made a critical comment about New York values some months back.	0
So I want to really hold up the importance of New York and what we stand for.	0
And, you know, we are a state that represents the diversity of America, the role that immigrants have played over the centuries in building-- our nation.	0
And the Statue of Liberty stands in the harbor.	0
So I wanted to start out with a very clear message about our values and--	0
Well, in and--	0
--why I think it's important we stand up for them.	0
In that ad, though, you do include footage, that awful footage, of a Trump supporter coldcocking, essentially, a protester at his rally.	0
Why amplify that image?	0
Because I was horrified by it, Chuck, and I think most Americans were horrified by it.	0
When you, as I've said before about Donald Trump's appearances, his rhetoric, his demagoguery, when you incite violence, you are acting like a political arsonist.	0
And I want people to understand there's a very different way of working towards our common ground that we have to seek and find in order to move our country forward.	0
We may have differences, of course we do.	0
But we don't condone violence.	0
We don't say we'll pay the legal fees of people who punch other Americans, who are protesting, attending an event.	0
That is just not appropriate behavior when you're running for president.	0
You know, also this week you were pretty tough on Donald Trump on one of his positions on abortion.	0
He had five different positions that we've counted up this week on abortion.	0
I want to ask you, what is yours?	0
Give me your straightforward position on the issue of abortion.	0
My position is in line with Roe v. Wade, that women have a constitutional right to make these most intimate and personal and difficult decisions based on their conscience, their faith, their family, their doctor and that it is something that really goes to the core of privacy.	0
And I want to maintain that constitutional protection under Roe v. Wade.	0
As you know, there is room for reasonable kinds of restrictions.	0
After a certain point in time, I think the life, the health of the mother are clear.	0
And those should be included even as one moves on in that pregnancy.	0
When or if--	0
So I've had the same position for many years.	0
When, or if, does an unborn child have constitutional rights?	0
Well, under our laws currently, that is not something that exists.	0
The unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights.	0
Now, that doesn't mean that we don't do everything we possibly can, in the vast majority of instances to, you know, help a mother who is carrying a child and wants to make sure that child will be healthy, to have appropriate medical support.	0
It doesn't mean that you don't do everything possible to try to fulfill your obligations.	0
But it does not include sacrificing the woman's right to make decisions.	0
And I think that's an important distinction, that under Roe v. Wade we've had enshrined under our Constitution.	0
You had said you think there is room for some restrictions.	0
So is it fair to say that women don't always have a full right to choose?	0
Well, under Roe v. Wade that is the law.	0
And as I said, I support the reasoning and the outcome in Roe v. Wade.	0
So in the third trimester of pregnancy, there is room for looking at the life and the health of the mother.	0
Now, most people, not all Republicans, not all conservatives even agree with the life of the mother.	0
But most do.	0
Where the distinction comes in is the health of the mother.	0
And when you have candidates running for president who say that there should be no exceptions, not for rape, not for incest, not for health, then I think you've gotten pretty extreme.	0
And my view has always been this is a choice.	0
It is not a mandate.	0
You know, I have traveled all over the world.	0
I have seen what happens when governments make these decisions, whether it was forced sterilization, forced abortion in China, or force childbearing in communist Romania.	0
So I don't think that we should be allowing the government to make decisions that really properly belong to the individual.	0
Let me move to the primary campaign.	0
Let me play this clip that got a lot of air time over the last few days, here it is.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Will you act on your word to reject fossil fuel money in the future in your campaign?	0
I do not have--I have money from people who work for fossil fuel companies.	0
I am so sick--I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me.	0
I’m sick of it.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Madame Secretary, I know you couldn't see the clip, but you probably heard it.	0
"You were caught saying, ""I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about my record."""	0
What are they lying about?	0
Well, let me first say that, you know, I'm used to criticism.	0
I've been taking it for a very long time.	0
But I care passionately about climate change.	0
And I have been working to try to move us away from fossil fuels for many years.	0
When I was in the Senate, I introduced legislation to take away the subsidies.	0
I voted against Dick Cheney's energy bill in 2005.	0
And I could go on and on.	0
When I got to be secretary of state, I was at the original meeting in 2009 with President Obama, where we were trying to convince China and India and others to come on board with accepting some restrictions that would lead to what finally occurred with the Paris agreement.	0
So when people make these kinds of claims, which now I think I have been debunked; actually The Washington Post said three Pinocchios, The New York Times also analyzed it, and other independent analysts have said that they are misrepresenting my record.	0
I'm just not going to, I feel sorry sometimes for the young people who, you know, believe this.	0
They don't do their own research.	0
"And I'm glad that we now can point to reliable, independent analysis to say, ""No, it's just not true."""	0
Do you believe that he's been lying about other parts of your record, or just this instance when you said that?	0
Well, I'm not, you know, I'm not going to go into that.	0
I think that we've tried to run a campaign on the issues.	0
I'm going to keep talking about the issues.	0
I was up in Syracuse yesterday talking about my new manufacturing plan, bring manufacturing back to America, let's make it in America.	0
That's what I think the American people are interested in hearing.	0
And I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing in this campaign, which is to, you know, draw the contrast, but stay on the issues.	0
Well, Senator Sanders had something to say about you today actually, campaigning in Wisconsin, and your paid speeches.	0
I'm going to play you the sound and get you to react.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Why else would they pay you $250,000?	0
It must be a speech written in Shakespearean prose.	0
And if it is such an unbelievably great speech, I think the Secretary should share that speech with rest of us.	0
(END TAPE)	0
I guess it's a backhanded compliment, comparing you to William Shakespeare.	0
But let me ask you this, you have said you would release the transcripts of these speeches when all of the other candidates have done.	0
Bernie Sanders is the only candidate in the Democratic race, and he says he's released all of his transcripts because he didn't give any of these paid speeches.	0
What say you?	0
Well, what I have said before, I will say again.	0
I've heard him say that.	0
And you know, look, I think what he's trying to imply, and I know his campaign tries to imply this, is undermining or, again, misrepresenting my record when it comes to being tough on Wall Street.	0
I have a record, Chuck.	0
It is out there in the public.	0
And I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against.	1
So I find this, again, a kind of, you know, circuitous way to raise questions about my record.	0
But I'm very proud of the fact that I have the most comprehensive approach towards taking on the problems that exist in the economy.	0
I don't just talk about breaking up the banks, because we now have the authority, thanks to President Obama, under Dodd-Frank.	0
I talk about taking the other risks on, like the hedge funds and everybody else.	0
But this gets to something else I think he's getting at, secrecy.	0
And the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel had a tough editorial against you this week.	0
"It said this of your candidacy: ""Her horrible track record on transparency raises serious questions for open government under a Clinton administration--so serious, we believe they may disqualify her from public office."	0
Regardless of Clinton's excuses, the only believable reason for the private server in her basement was to keep her emails out of the public eye by willfully avoiding Freedom of Information laws ... We encourage voters to think long and hard about the record when choosing the next president.	0
This issue of secrecy, or the accusation that you're secretive, has followed you for quite some time.	0
Is there any way you think you can at least convince Wisconsin voters that that's not the case?	0
Well, it's just a wrong set of assertions and conclusions.	0
And as you may know, I've received the vast majority of newspaper endorsements.	0
They all have the same information.	0
They have all analyzed it.	0
A lot of them have conducted interviews.	0
So let me just say again, I sent emails to government employees on their government accounts.	0
I had every reason to believe they were in the government system.	0
It was a matter of convenience.	0
I've said repeatedly, it was not the best choice.	0
It was a mistake.	0
But I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails.	1
Go and ask others for their emails.	0
Ask everybody else who's in public office.	0
I'm the one who's done it, and I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do.	0
Has the FBI reached out to you yet for an interview?	0
No, no, they haven't.	0
But, you know, back in August, we made clear that I'm happy to answer any questions that anybody might have.	0
And I stand by that.	0
Are you concerned that this isn't going to wrap up before the convention?	0
No, I'm not.	0
Because I don't think anything inappropriate was done.	0
And so I have to let them decide how to resolve their security inquiry, but I'm not at all worried about it.	0
All right, before I let you go, last week on this show Senator Sanders said he wanted to debate in New York.	0
I know you guys have been having a debate over debates over debates over debates.	0
Are you going to debate in New York, and when are you going to debate?	0
Well, I'm confident we will.	0
Our campaigns are trying to reach an agreement about that.	0
We've offered dates, and we've done it over the last several weeks.	0
So, you know, we've been trying to figure out when we could do this.	0
But there's a lot to talk about.	0
And since the last debate, we've had terrorist attacks in Brussels, Pakistan, and elsewhere--	0
You think there's got to be another debate.	0
You think there almost has to be.	0
I want--Look, I'm confident that there will be.	0
But I'm not the one negotiating it, that's going on between our campaigns.	0
And I do know my campaign has been really trying to get a time that Senators Sanders' campaign would agree with.	0
All right, he's proposed Sunday evening, April 17th.	0
Are you in?	0
I'm not negotiating, Chuck.	0
That's not, you know, we've proposed Thursday, the 14th, which gives people more time to digest what happens in the debate.	0
Is he in?	0
All right, well, we will ask him when we get the chance.	0
Secretary Clinton, I will leave it there.	0
From Milwaukee, stay safe on the campaign trail, we'll see you soon.	0
Thanks a lot, good to talk to you.	0
Take care.	0
You got it, bye now.	0
(END TAPE)	0
And when we come back, the Republican race and more on the worst week yet for the candidacy and candidate of Donald Trump.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
I'm not taking--	0
Just say it.	0
"“I’m never using nuclear weapon in Europe."""	0
I am not taking cards off the table.	0
(END TAPE)	0
From loose talk about nukes to multiple positions on abortion, why Donald Trump looks a little less like a sure thing today.	0
* * *COMMERCIAL BREAK* * *	0
Welcome back.	0
Let's now turn to the Republican race and Tuesday's Wisconsin primary.	0
Wisconsin has become sort of a New Hampshire part two.	0
The rare primary that stands alone on the calendar, and that may be as much about momentum as it is about actual delegates.	0
And it comes after a week that saw Trump's poll numbers fall and Republican criticism rise.	0
Not the least because Trump wound up explaining himself on abortion again and again and again and again.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
Very, very tough.	0
I'm not sure which is worse, dealing with the party people or dealing with the press.	0
Donald Trump is scrambling to regain momentum ahead of Tuesday's primary.	0
I just wanted to talk to the people of Wisconsin because there's so much misinformation that's being put out there about me.	0
Yet again, backpedalling on abortion.	0
As of this moment, the laws are set.	0
And I think we have to leave it that way.	0
In a statement, Trump's campaign tried to walk back the walk-back.	0
"Quote, ""Mr. Trump gave an accurate account of the law as it is today and made clear it must stay that way now--until he is president."	0
"Then he will change the law through his judicial appointments and allow the states to protect the unborn."""	0
It's Trump's fifth position on abortion this week, beginning with these comments to Chris Matthews on Wednesday.	0
The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment.	0
For the woman?	0
Yeah.	0
There has to be some form.	0
From the day in June when Trump launched his campaign and disparaged Mexican immigrants--	0
They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.	0
Trump's slash-and-burn version of straight talk has been the hallmark of his campaign.	0
In July, on John McCain.	0
He's a war hero because he was captured.	0
I like people that weren't captured, okay?	0
In August, on Fox host Megyn Kelly.	0
There was blood coming out of her eyes.	0
Blood coming out of her wherever.	0
"And in September on Carly Fiorina, ""Look at that face."""	0
Trump said he was referring to Fiorina's persona.	0
Trump has survived each episode, and all those that followed.	0
Thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down.	0
A total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.	0
Just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, okay?	0
Don't tell me it doesn't work.	0
Torture works, okay, folks?	0
I think Islam hates us.	0
"But I want you to say it, ""I'll never use a nuclear weapon in Europe."""	0
I am not taking cards off the table.	0
But can Trump go too far?	0
Even supporters believe some of his statements are embarrassing.	0
Do you realize our candidate is mental?	0
It's like constantly having to bail out your 16-year-old son from prison.	0
Though Trump's blunt talk has attracted many supporters to his campaign--	0
He's who he is.	0
He isn't a fake.	0
Sixty-eight percent of suburban voters, 70 percent of women and 77 percent of Hispanics now view Trump unfavorably.	0
Still, many Republican leaders fear it's too late to stop Trump and are preparing to enter the general election with a wounded nominee.	0
(END TAPE)	0
I'm joined now by Reince Priebus.	0
He's chairman of the Republican National Committee.	0
Mr. Chairman, welcome back to Meet the Press, sir.	0
Good morning, Chuck.	0
"You know, a month ago, you said when asked about the idea of an open convention, you said this: ""It's ... very early to have this conversation."	0
I think that in a month, if we're sitting in a situation where candidates are tied, then I think in a month you start looking at those possibilities.	0
"But right now, we've got a long way to go."""	0
Well, that was a month ago.	0
Here we are.	0
Is it fair to start looking at these possibilities of an open and contested convention?	0
Well, it looks like I'm a pretty good prognosticator, Chuck.	0
Yeah, I think that it's quite possible.	0
Certainly Wisconsin's going to be important in that conversation.	0
And still, after Wisconsin, either way, we're going to have two candidates that could get to the 1,237, the majority of delegates before we get to Cleveland.	0
And our role at the RNC is going to be to be a fair arbitrator and be a party that respects the voice and the vote of the voters and the delegates.	0
Well, it's interesting you say the voters and the delegates.	0
Who does choose the nominee here?	0
Is it Republican primary voters?	0
Is it the Republicans, or is it the delegates?	0
If there's one interviewer that probably knows the rules better than anyone, it's you, Chuck.	0
But I'll answer the question anyway.	0
Well, you know what I mean.	0
But the principle of it.	0
The principle.	0
Yeah, no, I understand.	0
Is it the party's voters that are picking this nominee or the party's delegates, which is a different set of people?	0
The nomination is won on the floor in Cleveland by the majority of delegates that get empowered and by the vote of the people.	0
So the voters in these states, their votes end up causing delegates to be bound to candidates, and those delegates will have to vote for those candidates on the floor.	0
There's no way around it.	0
"If a delegate is bound to a candidate, even if that delegate decides later, ""I don't care, I'm not voting for that person,"" the secretary at the convention will read the roll as if that delegate voted for the person that they're bound to, period."	0
You know, one of the things that I think has been a misconception is that somehow, the rules of 2012 will apply to the 2016 election.	0
And the reason this comes up is because there was a rule in 2012 that said if you didn't win a majority of delegates in eight states, you couldn't get your name put into nomination.	0
What is the likelihood that that rule stays for 2016?	0
Or are all the rules for how this election conducted going to get rewritten come July?	0
Well, I'm of course guessing here.	0
I don't have any power to change any rules, Chuck.	0
But I think it's probably unlikely that you see major changes.	0
But again, as you say, the 2012 rules were written by the 2012 delegates who were bound to Mitt Romney.	0
And so Mitt Romney's rules of 2012 will not be the rules that apply to the 2016 convention, which will be made largely of Trump and Cruz delegates.	0
And why would people want the Romney delegates' rules to apply to Cruz and Trump and Kasich?	0
It doesn't make any sense.	0
So the rules committee will come together.	0
Those delegates will get on these committees, they'll review the rules, and the 2016 rules will apply to the 2016 conventions.	0
Is it fair, you know, the Trump campaign is not happy with what happened in Tennessee this weekend.	0
It's a state primary he won, he still has the same amount of delegates that he won, 33, but he didn't get to choose the individuals, the state party did.	0
"And in fact, his senior advisor in his campaign told this to us, he said, ""I've been told two of the delegates are truly Trump delegates."	0
"Five are pretend delegates."""	0
Meaning these are people that will be bound for two ballots, but don't plan on support him.	0
Is that fair?	0
Is that fair?	0
Well, first of all, the delegates, there's two parts of the process.	0
One is you've got to get the delegate allocation, meaning when you win the state, you're allocated a certain amount of delegates.	0
Donald Trump has 33 delegates in Tennessee.	0
And they're bound to Donald Trump, not just for one vote, but in Tennessee, they're actually bound for two votes.	0
And nothing can change that.	0
Now, the selection of delegates, who's in those seats is something that happens at the state party level and these campaigns have to have serious operations in the states, and they have to make sure that those people do their best job in getting their own, the people they want, to be in those seats.	0
So it doesn't just happen automatically.	0
It has to be done through work and preparation.	0
Are you confident Donald Trump can win a general election?	0
Sure, I think all of our candidates can win a general election, especially when you look at Hillary Clinton--	0
Is he your best candidate?	0
--who quite possibly could be indicted, and who knows.	0
They're the ones that could have an open convention, and Joe Biden could be the nominee of the Democratic party.	0
But is Donald Trump your strongest candidate?	0
I don't know.	0
Listen, I don't worry about who is the strongest candidate.	0
Obviously, we have our own conversations here.	0
But the fact is that we're here, prepared to support whoever the eventual nominee is, with the biggest, best Republican National Committee that we've ever put together, Chuck.	0
And one last question.	0
Considering we're going to have an open convention, you have three candidates fighting for delegates and worried about who those people are.	0
Should the RNC be in charge of the V.P.	0
running mate vetting process, considering that everything is going to get scrambling.	0
Have you offered to provide those services to the candidate?	0
You know, not particularly.	0
I mean, we certainly are equipped with our research team to do it.	0
But that's another interesting question.	0
Because the delegates choose the vice president as well.	0
And that's a subject no one's really talking about, is that that's another vote on the floor that the delegates choose.	0
And so while I'm sure, obviously, the choice of whoever the nominee is going to be important, it's still up for a vote of the delegates.	0
Well, all that means is more reasons to watch what happens in Cleveland.	0
Reince Priebus, chairman of the RNC, thanks for coming on the show, sir.	0
Thanks.	0
Appreciate it.	0
Later in the broadcast, why many Republicans fear Donald Trump might not only lose the race for the White House, but could cost them their Senate majority as well.	0
And our friends at S.N.L.	0
had some funlast night with Trump saying a woman should be punished for having an abortion.	0
Take a listen.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
You don't say that on TV.	0
"Even if you're on Wheel of Fortune and the board says, ""Women should be ‘unished,’ "" don't say it."	0
(END TAPE)	0
*** COMMERCIAL BREAK ***	0
Welcome back.	0
This Tuesday's Wisconsin primary could be one of the most influential of the campaign season.	0
And it's not the first time the Badger State has been so important in presidential politics.	0
In fact, ever wonder how we got into this whole presidential primary process in the first place?	0
It's all thanks to Wisconsin, the very first state to come up with the idea of a presidential primary, which votes this Tuesday.	0
But it wasn't until April, 1960, that the importance of the Wisconsin primary first came into play.	0
In fact, here was Meet the Press that week.	0
In fact, 56 years ago today, with moderator Ned Brooks.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
This week, the eyes of the nation will be fastened on Wisconsin's presidential primary.	0
Two Democratic senators, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, and John Kennedy of Massachusetts are competing in the first, and perhaps the most important, contested primary of 1960.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Interestingly Kennedy and Humphrey watched the election returns together in the Milwaukee Journal newsroom.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
How have the votes in thus far shaped up according to your expectations?	0
Well, I was hopeful we could take six districts and I think we had a good chance to do that.	0
Which will give us--I hope--win the majority of the popular vote, which would give us the result.	0
(END TAPE)	0
And look at that, talking about district delegates.	0
Anyway, Kennedy would win that night on his path to the nomination, and eventually the presidency.	0
Let's then jump ahead to 1976, with contested primaries in both parties.	0
President Gerald Ford beat Ronald Reagan handily in Wisconsin, no doubt thanks to this photo op two days prior, with Green Bay Packers quarterback Bart Starr, Go Pack Go.	0
But the real race was on the Democratic side.	0
Jimmy Carter versus Mo Udall.	0
That evening, it looked like Udall had squeaked by Carter.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
And let me tell you, I've finished second, and tonight I finished first.	0
And I like first a lot better.	0
(END TAPE)	0
"But as more votes came in overnight, Carter took the lead, and the networks reversed their calls, giving Carter his very own ""Dewey defeats Truman"" moment."	0
"The next day, Mo Udall told reporters, ""You know all those times I said 'win' last night?"	0
"Well, strike that and insert the word lose."""	0
As always with Mo Udall, he always had a sense of humor no matter what the result.	0
So what will the Badger State hold in store for us this week?	0
It's going to be a fun one.	0
But here's what we do know.	0
It's going to be influential.	0
When we come back, Republicans are increasingly worried that Donald Trump could take the party down with him.	0
What are the chances that they could take the nomination away from him first?	0
***COMMERCIAL BREAK***	0
Panel is here.	0
It is Wisconsin primary week.	0
So we flew in one of the smartest reporters from the state, Charles Benson from our local affiliate there, WTMJ in Milwaukee.	0
Helene Cooper, Pentagon correspondent for The New York Times is also here, Amy Walter, editor of The Cook Political Report, and David Brooks, columnist for The New York Times, welcome all.	0
Charles, I'll start with you.	0
On the ground, is this looking as bad for Trump as the polls say it is?	0
Well, clearly he had a bad week.	0
But the anti-Trump forces were already going at him.	0
You know, they knew that they were going to come into Wisconsin and make Wisconsin their Waterloo.	0
But what they found out when they got there, the ground troops were already there, especially with conservative talk radio.	0
I mean, they have been hammering him locally, local conservative talk radio been hammering him for weeks.	0
But also, you have to keep in mind, Scott Walker, Paul Ryan, alright?	0
Scott Walker's endorsed Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan hasn't endorsed anybody.	0
But clearly, those two guys, their brand of politics has been really big time conservative issues.	0
And they've won.	0
And they've won.	0
So they have something to be happy about in Wisconsin.	0
They do.	0
And so they, when they look at that brand of politics, that works better than what the Trump brand of politics is right now.	0
All right, David.	0
We've been here, I want to say four weeks ago you were convinced Trump wasn't going to get the nomination.	0
Two weeks ago, you wanted to say you were convinced, but you weren't comfortable saying anything.	0
Where are you today?	0
Morally defeated.	0
Something's changed though.	0
Something has changed, we think?	0
Yeah something has changed.	0
"All these people keep waiting for him, ""When is he going to turn into a philosopher king?"	0
"It’s time he should become Abraham Lincoln."""	0
He's Donald Trump.	0
You know, he’s - you know, it's all aggression, it's all ignorance, it's all the time.	0
But I think he's going to have a bad week this week.	0
I think he'll probably rally in New York, and it'll all come down to California.	0
The people in the Republican party are not going to stop him.	0
Look at that Reince Priebus' interview today.	0
Like, the week that we had with Donald Trump, he's a catastrophe of the party.	0
Priebus is off in la la land, talking about technical stuff, and not really seizing the mantle.	0
That's where the Republican establishment.	0
So they're not going to beat him.	0
The only way he gets beat is if he internally collapses and if his supporters morally collapse because of bad defeats in places like California and New York.	0
They're like Oklahoma at the end of the Villanova game, there's nothing there.	0
But nobody's going to take it away from him.	0
Do you think David's right?	0
Or I feel as if though something changed.	0
I mean, you look at what's happening on the ground, in the technical parts of this, right, where you have Tennessee party chair making sure he's putting party operatives into the delegate spots, even in the Trump seats, that they're at least seeding this so that they can stop Trump if they have the opportunity.	0
Here's where Republicans are right now.	0
They get to decide if they wanna have a civil war if Trump wins, or a civil war if Trump loses.	0
There is no winner out of this whole fight.	0
So he can either come into Cleveland with the amount of delegates.	0
I think Wisconsin will tell us whether or not he will be able to get 1,237.	0
He loses Wisconsin by a big amount, I don't think he's going to be able to make that up.	0
Or he’ll be very close.	0
Or we go to Cleveland and we have another civil war where yeah, technically, they could take it away from him.	0
This is how it works.	0
Reince isn’t incorrect.	0
The delegates select who the president is.	0
But there are going to be a whole bunch of Republicans very upset about it, even people who didn't vote for Donald Trump, because they see, as you pointed out, is this fair?	0
Is this fair?	0
And that is going to just split this party apart.	0
"And anybody who thinks that Donald Trump is just going to go away if he loses this like, ""Oh, well, he's not going to be able to get on a ballot,"" he's got Twitter and he's got cable TV."	0
And he's going to spend all of his time there.	0
Helene, I'm curious.	0
You know, he's talked a lot about NATO this week in weird ways, he's talked a lot about nukes and nuclear policy.	0
I'm just curious, what do the folks at the Pentagon think?	0
And I'm not talking about the political operatives, I'm talking about the career folks who are going to be there if Trump's elected president or if Clinton's elected president.	0
No, they were appalled.	0
You know, last week, I was on a Navy cruiser in the South China Sea that was doing this diplomatic dance with China.	0
We had a Chinese ship that was trailing us.	0
"And several times, I got into conversations with sailors about, you know, ""This is all about how we, you know, how we strategize in a really important area, could Donald Trump even handle something like this?"""	0
And then you had this week, with Donald Trump's message is about, and what he said about South Korea and Japan, which the Japanese prime minister immediately recanted, or dismissed.	0
But, and you have that juxtaposed against President Obama's Washington Nuclear Summit, in which you had heads of states from all over the world sitting here, carefully talking about nuclear disarmament and how do we go about doing it.	0
I just think when you look at all of the things that happened to Donald Trump this week, and the abortion issue was horrible for him, but I think the nuclear issue, I think, ends up scaring people particularly at the Pentagon and the national security apparatus a whole lot more.	0
All right.	0
If Trump falls though, the beneficiary is Ted Cruz.	0
Ted Cruz, if Ted Cruz wins Wisconsin, Charles, is it because there are a whole bunch of Cruz Republicans, or is he really benefiting from Stop Trump right now?	0
Well, I think he's benefiting from the Stop Trump right now.	0
Clearly, it's getting late to get to the dance, and they were looking for a dance partner, and Ted Cruz was the guy.	0
Yeah, why Cruz and not Kasich though?	0
Some of us would have thought Kasich might fit this state better.	0
Right when you look at the match-up from Kasich, you would think he would match what the conservative brand would be in Wisconsin.	0
I mean, Wisconsin's pretty conservative right now.	0
They’ve got the conservative governor, got a conservative legislature, they control both houses.	0
And they have a conservative high court.	0
He got the backing Kasich of the former governor, Tommy Thompson, who has won there four times.	0
"But I think they felt that Cruz, when they were looking at the difference between Cruz and Kasich, they were saying, ""Who can beat Trump?"	0
"How can we get to the convention with a guy?"""	0
And they felt Ted Cruz was the guy.	0
David Brooks, what do you most likely think is going to happen now?	0
Is it Trump, Cruz, or Paul Ryan?	0
I think it's likely to be Trump.	0
I think he's the walking dead.	0
I think he'll get the nomination and he will just go down to a crushing defeat.	0
"And will be known for a hundred years from now, people will say, ""Who's the biggest loser in American politics?"""	0
And it won't be McGovern, it won't be Dukakis, the word Trump.	0
And I hope when he's down there in Hades he's aware of all that.	0
Wow.	0
Very subtle.	0
Very subtle.	0
Why do I have a feeling Mr. Brooks is going to hear from Mr. Trump sometime on social media today?	0
Anyway, with that, we'll take a pause.	0
When we come back, down ballot blues.	0
We're going to stick with Wisconsin as a theme.	0
What does Donald Trump at the top of the ticket mean for Republicans further down?	0
We'll be right back.	0
***COMMERCIAL BREAK***	0
Welcome back.	0
One of the reasons the Republican establishment has the jitters over Donald Trump is the worry that having Trump at the top of the ticket will hurt the party's chances of keeping control of the house and the Senate.	0
My next guest, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson is up for reelection in November and does face a tough fight to hold onto his seat in a swing state that has gone blue more often than not.	0
Senator Johnson, welcome back to Meet the Press.	0
Morning, Chuck.	0
How are you doing?	0
I'm pretty good.	0
Let me ask you straight up.	0
Are you going to say who you're voting for on Tuesday?	0
Are you going to endorse before Tuesday?	0
I have not endorsed.	0
You know, I've certainly stated my intention to support whoever the Republican nominee is.	0
I've got to have faith in Wisconsin primary voters as well as American - or the Republican primary voters on a national level.	0
So that's my intention.	0
It's interesting you put it that way.	0
Do you plan on supporting the candidate who wins the primary on Tuesday in Wisconsin?	0
Do you think that's the most appropriate action?	0
Well, again, what I will do is I will support whoever the delegates in the national convention actually chooses for a nominee.	0
And we've got three and a half months to go here before that's actually determined.	0
You know, three and a half months is a lifetime in politics.	0
So nobody can predict exactly how this is going to turn out.	0
You know, you’ve been - it's been surprising to hear from you as compared to some of your other fellow Republican senators who are running for reelection in swing states.	0
You're one of the few that says publicly that you think Donald Trump helps you in your reelection, that he doesn't hurt you.	0
Why?	0
No.	0
I think what I've been talking about is, you know, from my standpoint, I'm a businessperson.	0
I'm a completely outsider.	0
And that certainly is what has resonated about his campaign in many respects.	0
But, you know, from my standpoint, I think what this campaign ought to be about is, you know, growth.	0
How do you grow our economy?	0
It's the number one component for a solution.	0
I think what candidates are finding out here in Wisconsin is we have some very discerning primary voters here on the Republican side.	0
And like Charles mentioned, a lot has to do with our exceptional talk radio hosts across the state.	0
And I think some of the candidates found out exactly exceptional they really are in terms of asking tough questions.	0
And that's really what elections are about, and sort of primaries about, is getting out the truth.	0
All right.	0
Senator, by saying what you said, you're all but implying you're not for Trump.	0
You're all but implying by essentially praising how great these conservative radio can be, how do we not interpret that as an anti-Trump sentiment coming from you?	0
Because I'm saying what I'm saying.	0
I'm not endorsing somebody.	0
That obviously speaks for itself.	0
"The last primary, I did endorse Mitt Romney, and I'll tell you why I endorsed Mitt Romney, it's why I met with him beforehand, he said, ""Ron, I expect to be a one-term president, because I'm going to fix these problems."""	0
And then when he picked Paul Ryan as a running mate, it just confirmed that my choice was correct.	0
So obviously, I don't have a comfort level.	0
You know, let's face it.	0
No two people agree on everything.	0
I'll tell you what, though, is certain, is I will never vote for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or whoever the Democrat nominee may be.	0
So again, I'm looking, and I've got to put my faith and trust in Republican primary voters, and I intend to support the Republican nominee, whoever that person may or may not be.	0
Let me ask you this.	0
What advice would you give Donald Trump to improve his chances in Wisconsin?	0
Right now, we've got polling that shows he trails Hillary Clinton by ten points.	0
Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton are tied in Wisconsin.	0
And John Kasich actually leads her.	0
But if Trump's the nominee, what advice would you give Donald Trump to improve his standing in Wisconsin?	0
It's the same advice I'd give anybody in a primary or a general election.	0
Show your vision for America, for Wisconsin, and certainly in a Republican primary, show the primary voters how you intend to take that vision to defeat the Democratic nominee.	0
Let's face it, we're going to be facing either a socialist, I think we should all remember that socialism isn't hasn't worked.	0
Not in the Soviet Union, not in Venezuela, certainly not in what should be the island paradise of Cuba.	0
And Hillary Clinton has so much baggage, you know, she's going to be a very flawed candidate if she ends up being selected.	0
Alright, final question.	0
Merrick Garland, the President's choice for the Supreme Court vacancy, you said something interesting.	0
You said, you implied that if this were a Republican president filling a conservative seat, this would go through without a problem.	0
I guess my question to you is if Merrick Garland were replacing a liberal seat on the court, would you be more inclined to see this nomination and confirmation process go forward?	0
No, I think what Vice President Biden said in 1992 is pretty accurate.	0
In such a politicized atmosphere, with just a couple, literally eight months before an election, let the American people have a voice in choosing the direction of the Supreme Court when they're choosing the direction of the country.	0
Under any circumstance?	0
You don't think Supreme Court nominations should happen in a final year of a presidency in a presidential election year ever?	0
I think it's pretty problematic.	0
And particularly with the Judge Garland in Wisconsin here, he appears to be pretty hostile to Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms, which would not be popular in Wisconsin.	0
So I'm doing my job in protecting the Second Amendment rights of Wisconsinites by just withholding my consent.	0
Alright.	0
Senator Ron Johnson, Republican from Wisconsin up for reelection.	0
Thanks for coming on the show, sir.	0
Thanks for having me.	0
You got it.	0
We'll be back in 45 seconds with our endgame segment and the Democrats.	0
Why can't Hillary Clinton put away Bernie Sanders?	0
***COMMERCIAL BREAK***	0
And we're back with endgame.	0
I want you to listen to something Bernie Sanders said Thursday.	0
(BEGIN TAPE)	0
We have won six out of the last seven caucuses.	0
Most of them by landslide victories.	0
And I think that, uh, superdelegates should listen to the will of their people.	0
If you get 60, 70, 80 percent of the vote in a state, you know what, I think superdelegates should vote for us.	0
(END TAPE)	0
Okay.	0
So we decided to crunch the numbers on that basis to see how much it would benefit Senator Sanders, if all of the superdelegates in states he's won so far chose him.	0
So take a look.	0
Right now, looking at states where people have voted so far, the current superdelegate count in those states is Clinton, with 253 versus Sanders with just 25 superdelegates, with some superdelegates still undecided.	0
If those superdelegates vote the way their states have voted so far, then they would divide this way: Clinton would actually increase her lead a little bit, increase her total to 260, Bernie Sanders would get to 124, because some of those undecideds that were in there would be allocated to help Hillary Clinton.	0
But those numbers just show you, Hillary Clinton still would lead with superdelegates too.	0
He doesn't have a path, does he?	0
No.	0
Look, this race is, it's still going on, and it's important for Hillary Clinton to remain engaged.	0
And I give Bernie Sanders a lot of credit from starting from zero and getting to where he is right now.	0
It's an impressive-- and he's made this debate about his issues and he's made her fight on his turf.	0
That said, the delegate math is not going to add up and it's not working.	0
But when you compare where Democrats are to where Republicans are, Democrats are having a skirmish right now.	0
Republicans are in thermonuclear war, okay?	0
It is not-- so it's a little bit messy, and so it's going to be a little harder for her, and maybe it's not over until June.	0
But they are going to be united, Democratic partisans right now like Bernie Sanders as much as they like Hillary Clinton.	0
They are not going to have a problem unifying the party in the way Republicans are.	0
Look, David-- go ahead.	0
Alright, let me just say.	0
I think Wisconsin's going to be good for Bernie Sanders.	0
He's expected to win there.	0
This is not going to be 2008 though for Hillary Clinton where she got clobbered by double digits.	0
This could be a single-digit win.	0
But everybody knows that Bernie Sanders needs a big win.	0
And you talked about April 5th, 1960, John F. Kennedy, you know, coming out of Wisconsin, getting some legitimacy.	0
But think about it, April 5th, 1910, Wisconsin, I should say Milwaukee, was the first major American city, key word there major American, to have and elect a socialist mayor.	0
They've done it three times.	0
So that's good news.	0
For Bernie Sanders.	0
For Bernie Sanders.	0
Former socialist mayor of Burlington .	0
But David, why--	0
I think he voted in that election.	0
Oh, come on.	0
Boy, you are just going to make everybody mad, aren't you?	0
But Hillary Clinton is struggling to close out this nomination.	0
Let's call it what it is.	0
She is struggling to do it.	0
Amy's right.	0
It is a skirmish.	0
"It is not this-- but if there wasn't a Republican fight, we'd be going, ""What's going on here?"	0
"Why can't she close the deal?"""	0
If Donald Trump didn't exist, we would all be talking about how she is the most unpopular nominee in recent American history.	0
She would be that, instead Donald Trump is that.	0
There happens to be this other guy.	0
What strikes me is there are two motivations for voters.	0
There's philosophy, and Sanders sort of has that.	0
But there's also party loyalty.	0
I was watching your interview with her earlier.	0
"And I was thinking, ""If Ed Muskie or Hubert Humphrey came back and they saw her, they'd thought, “That's what a Democratic candidate looks like.'"""	0
Or-- and sounds like.	0
Yeah.	0
And so she's part of the party, the embodied history of the party.	0
And so there's a machine-like quality, it's hard to get super excited by her, but there's a comfort level for Democratic voters.	0
And that's carrying her, but it doesn't inspire.	0
I was also struck though during your interview with Hillary, with Senator Clinton, on your questions about abortion.	0
And you guys spent a lot of time during that interview, about four to five minutes.	0
It's something you don't do very often with Democratic candidates.	0
No, you don't.	0
But she answered you and she went back and she had history and she had precedent to cite, and she talked about third world, uh, other countries she went through.	0
And then I started imagining you doing that interview with Donald Trump.	0
And where he gets that, when he's with Chris Matthews, and he gets that deer-with-his-eyes-caught look in his face, where you see he's grappling for an answer and he's out of his depth and he's not sure how he's going to answer it.	0
And I think what this week and what happened with Donald Trump played the beneficiary of this the most I think is Hillary Clinton.	0
Because if ever there was, like, you had, like, a sort of, an edging out the differences between candidates, she's the one who I think is the winner.	0
But I wonder, the more clarity, it's funny.	0
I agree.	0
"This week, this was the first time you thought, ""Boy, she could really--"" you could see how she's going to match up pretty well with Donald Trump."	0
Republican delegates are going to see that Amy, right?	0
Well, they haven't seen it yet.	0
Right, but they're gonna--	0
This is really the most fascinating thing.	0
There have been polls out now for a long time that showed that he has problems with women.	0
That shows that he has problems with pretty much every single demographic group.	0
And yet--	0
Except white men.	0
Except for white men.	0
And yet, it has not impacted him in these primaries.	0
In fact, I went back and I looked at this point in 2012, almost 40 percent of Republicans said beating Obama was their top priority and they voted for Mitt Romney.	0
Today, 13 percent of Republicans say that electability is their top issue.	0
It's not about beating Hillary Clinton.	0
It is about putting the candidate that they think represents their values better.	0
And that's where Trump and Cruz fit the bill.	0
But this is how they ended up losing in 2012.	0
That's how we get back to, now we're moving towards a general election.	0
Now we're starting, you know, what we've seen so far are these two, these two, in these two, primaries the people on the left and the people on right.	0
Charles, let me ask you this, you get the final comment on this.	0
Who's going to have an easier time coming together, this sort of a polarized Democratic electorate in Wisconsin or a polarized Republican electorate in Wisconsin?	0
I think the Democrats have an easier time coming together.	0
You know, they both are looking pretty good, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and I think at the end of the day, we saw it last night.	0
They had the founders party for the Democrats.	0
You could have called it the unity party-- the unity, uh--	0
They didn't fight that much?	0
They really didn't fight that much.	0
So I think they'll be able to come together.	0
All right, thank you all.	0
Charles, thanks for coming down.	0
Thank you for having me.	0
You've got to get out of here, because I know, you've got some more work to do.	0
That's all we have for today.	0
We'll be back next week.	0
Because as you know, if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.	0
It is 9:00 p.m. here at the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center in South Carolina.	0
Welcome to the sixth Republican presidential of the 2016 campaign, here on the Fox Business Network.	0
I'm Neil Cavuto, alongside my friend and co-moderator Maria Bartiromo.	0
Tonight we are working with Facebook to ask the candidates the questions voters want answered.	0
And according to Facebook, the U.S. election has dominated the global conversation, with 131 million people talking about the 2016 race.	0
That makes it the number one issue talked about on Facebook last year worldwide.	0
Now, the seven candidates on the stage tonight were selected based on their standing in six national polls, as well as polls in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, those standings determining the position on the stage of the candidates tonight.	0
And here they are.	0
Businessman Donald Trump.	0
[ applause ]	0
Texas senator Ted Cruz.	0
[ applause ]	0
Florida senator Marco Rubio.	0
[ applause ]	0
Neurosurgeon Ben Carson.	0
[ applause ]	0
New Jersey governor Chris Christie.	0
[ applause ]	0
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.	0
And Ohio governor John Kasich.	0
[ applause ]	0
Tonight's rules are simple: up to 90 seconds for each answer, one minute for each follow-up response.	0
And if a candidate goes over the allotted time, you'll hear this.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
So let's get started.	0
Candidates, jobs and growth — two of the biggest issues facing the country right now.	0
"In his State of the Union address earlier this week, the president said, quote, ""we have the strongest, most durable economy in the world."""	0
And according to our Facebook research, jobs is one of the biggest issues resonating across the country, including here in South Carolina.	0
The president is touting 14 million new jobs and an unemployment rate cut in half.	0
The president said that anyone who claims America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction.	0
Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn't?	0
Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.	0
Let me start — I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something.	0
Today, many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads.	0
In that State of the Union, President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been captured by Iran.	0
President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei.	0
And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.	0
But the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Now, on to your substantive question.	0
The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs.	0
And you know, he's right.	0
If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great.	0
The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama.	0
But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.	1
Median wages have stagnated.	1
And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.	1
The reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country, and not Washington, D.C.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but	0
[ inaudible ]	0
investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value.	0
That makes it the worst start to a new year ever.	0
Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.	0
Now, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example, you are taking over the presidency?	0
Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs.	0
And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt.	0
And our economy was growing like crazy.	0
It's the same thing that I did in Ohio.	0
It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety.	0
It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way.	0
And if you tax cuts — if you cut taxes for corporations, and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the — in the world.	0
But in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline.	0
We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget.	0
And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.	0
Right now, you don't have the — you have taxes that are too high.	0
You have regulations — I mean, come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses.	0
They are — they're in a position where they're smothering people.	0
And I mean, are you kidding me?	0
We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.	0
Those three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise.	0
You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy.	0
And how do I know it?	0
Because I've done it.	0
I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici.	0
And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.	0
Our wages are growing faster than the national average.	0
We're running surpluses.	0
And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.	0
[ applause ]	0
We know that recent global events have many people worried — Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.	0
Governor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire.	0
Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?	0
Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.	0
Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama.	0
And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?	0
[ applause ]	0
The fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess.	0
The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world.	0
And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.	0
Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.	0
And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.	0
Next, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience.	0
And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right.	0
It's a — it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.	0
The president doesn't understand — and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton — and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.	0
If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.	0
I will not do that.	0
If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.	0
[ applause ]	0
Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?	0
MIlitary action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.	0
We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.	0
And the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either.	0
We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships.	0
It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker, well, it's just rhetoric and hot air.	0
Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies.	0
I guess they would include you.	0
What do you say?	0
Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe.	0
The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.	0
Think about it.	0
With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand) to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists.	0
He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.	0
In the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.	0
[ applause ]	0
I've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military.	0
In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force.	0
Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us, and we're in a much difficult — we're in a much different position than we should be.	0
And for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well.	0
Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.	0
As president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military.	0
We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.	0
[ applause ]	0
So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.	0
No.	0
And worse — worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.	0
Think about it.	0
She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have — that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess.	0
And that is wrong.	0
And you know what?	0
Here's the problem.	0
If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.	1
If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.	1
We need to stop that.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn't threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.	0
But House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states.	0
So how do you define the threat?	0
Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?	0
Yeah, I would go, first of all, one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton.	0
She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
Someone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States.	0
Ever.	0
[ applause ]	0
On the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power.	0
Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size.	0
And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.	0
He doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.	0
He consistently underestimates it but I do not.	0
There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.	0
When I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS.	0
The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them.	0
And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government.	0
How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?	0
Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on.	0
I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.	0
[ laughter ]	0
You know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations.	0
The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century, and that war is very different than it used to be before.	0
Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid.	0
And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously.	0
And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.	0
I mean, just think about a scenario like that.	0
They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse.	0
They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.	0
Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point?	0
He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.	0
But here's the real key.	0
We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it.	0
And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack.	0
Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he's now trying to start a new life.	0
The president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum.	0
How do you answer that?	0
It's not fear and terror, it's reality.	0
You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.	0
[ applause ]	0
You look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a — the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world, and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow.	0
They're very, very badly wounded.	0
They will — some will follow.	0
And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor — very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.	1
That could be the great Trojan Horse.	0
It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction.	0
When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?	1
It looked like very few women.	1
Very few children.	1
Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?	0
You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized — they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 — going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look — a good strong look and that's what we have.	0
We are nineteen trillion dollars — our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders.	0
We can't do it.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank.	0
"During your senate race, your campaign said, ""it was inadvertent."""	0
A million dollars is inadvertent?	0
Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times.	0
You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views.	0
"The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, ""Anybody But Cruz."""	0
"Had that actually — that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move, ""It Follows"" that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people."	0
So you know the New York Times and I don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships.	0
Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate — unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars.	0
When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars.	0
He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I, we ended up investing everything we owned.	0
We took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks.	0
And the entire New York times attack — is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing.	0
But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other.	0
But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.	0
Thank you.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
All right.	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential , right here in North Charleston, South Carolina.	0
Let's get right back to the questions.	0
And I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.	0
Now you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist — no one would doubt that.	0
And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States.	0
Stop me if you've heard this before.	0
Now, you were born...	0
[ laughter ]	0
... you were born in Canada to an American mother.	0
So you were and are considered an American citizen.	0
But that fellow next to you, Donald Trump — and others — have said that being born in Canada means you are not natural-born, and that has raised questions about your eligibility.	0
Do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight?	0
Well, Neil, I'm glad we're focusing on the important topics of the evening.	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
You know, back in September, my friend Donald said that he had had his lawyers look at this from every which way, and there was no issue there.	0
There was nothing to this birther issue.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But the poll numbers have.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I recognize — I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.	0
But the facts and the law here are really quite clear.	0
Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.	0
If a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.	0
That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.	0
If an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen.	0
That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.	0
At the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on — some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil.	0
Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and, interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified.	0
[ applause ]	0
Not me.	0
Because — because Donald's mother was born in Scotland.	0
She was naturalized.	0
Now, Donald...	0
But I was born here.	0
... on the issue — on the issue of citizenship, Donald...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
Big difference.	0
... on the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you.	0
OK, good.	0
Because it wouldn't work.	0
You're an American, as is everybody else on this stage, and I would suggest we focus on who's best prepared to be commander- in-chief, because that's the most important question facing the country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...that you raised it because of his rising poll numbers.	0
... first of all, let me just tell you something — and you know, because you just saw the numbers yourself — NBC Wall Street Journal just came out with a poll — headline: Trump way up, Cruz going down.	0
I mean, so don't — so you can't — you can't...	0
[ booing ]	0
...they don't like the Wall Street Journal.	0
They don't like NBC, but I like the poll.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And frankly, it just came out, and in Iowa now, as you know, Ted, in the last three polls, I'm beating you.	0
So — you know, you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls.	0
[ applause ]	0
You don't have to say that.	0
In fact, I was all for you until you started doing that, because that's a misrepresentation, number one.	0
Number two, this isn't me saying it.	0
I don't care.	0
I think I'm going to win fair and square	0
[ inaudible ]	0
to win this way.	0
Thank you.	0
Lawrence Tribe and	0
[ inaudible ]	0
from Harvard — of Harvard, said that there is a serious question as to whether or not Ted can do this.	0
OK?	0
There are other attorneys that feel, and very, very fine constitutional attorneys, that feel that because he was not born on the land, he cannot run for office.	0
Here's the problem.	0
We're running.	0
We're running.	0
He does great.	0
I win.	0
I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride.	0
I don't like that.	0
OK?	0
[ laughter ]	0
The fact is — and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field, he beats the rest of the field	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
See, they don't like that.	0
They don't like that.	0
[ audience booing ]	0
No, they don't like he beats the rest of the field, because they want me.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But — if for some reason, Neil, he beats the rest of the field, I already know the Democrats are going to be bringing a suit.	0
You have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running.	0
And if you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?	0
So you should go out, get a declaratory judgment, let the courts decide.	0
And you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because I would have been much...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Why are you saying this now — right now?	0
Why are you raising this issue now?	0
Because now he's going a little bit better.	0
No, I didn't care	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
It's true.	0
No, it's true.	0
Hey look, he never had a chance.	0
Now, he's doing better.	0
He's got probably a four or five percent chance.	0
[ laughter ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Neil...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
The fact is, there is a big overhang.	0
There's a big question mark on your head.	0
And you can't do that to the party.	0
You really can't.	0
You can't do that to the party.	0
You have to have certainty.	0
Even if it was a one percent chance, and it's far greater than one percent because	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
I mean, you have great constitutional lawyers that say you can't run.	0
If there was a — and you know I'm not bringing a suit.	0
I promise.	0
But the Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit, and you have to have certainty.	0
You can't have a question.	0
I can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head.	0
Senator, do you want to respond?	0
Well, listen, I've spent my entire life defending the Constitution before the U.S. Supreme Court.	0
And I'll tell you, I'm not going to be taking legal advice from Donald Trump.	0
You don't have to.	0
Take it from Lawrence Tribe.	0
[	0
applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Take it from your professors...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
The chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero.	0
And Mr. Trump is very focused...	0
He's wrong.	0
He's wrong.	0
... on Larry Tribe.	0
Let me tell you who Larry Tribe is.	0
He's a left-wing judicial activist, Harvard Law professor who was Al Gore's lawyer in Bush versus Gore.	0
He's a major Hillary Clinton supporter.	0
And there's a reason why Hillary's supporters are echoing Donald's attacks on me, because Hillary...	0
He is not the only one.	0
... wants to face Donald Trump in the general election.	0
There are many lawyers.	0
And I'll tell you what, Donald, you — you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P.	0
slot.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I'll tell you what.	0
If this all works out, I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P.	0
So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.	0
No — no...	0
[ laughter ]	0
...	0
I think if it doesn't...	0
[ applause ]	0
I like that.	0
I like it.	0
I'd consider it.	0
But I think I'll go back to building buildings if it doesn't work out.	0
Actually, I'd love to get you to build a wall.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I have a feeling it's going to work out, actually.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Let me	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
I was invoked in that question, so let me just say — in that answer — let me say, the real question here, I hate to interrupt this episode of Court TV.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But the real — but I think we have to get back to what this election has to be about.	0
OK?	0
Listen, we — this is the greatest country in the history of mankind.	0
But in 2008, we elected a president that didn't want to fix America.	0
He wants to change America.	0
We elected a president that doesn't believe in the Constitution.	0
He undermines it.	0
We elected a president that is weakening America on the global stage.	0
We elected a president that doesn't believe in the free enterprise system.	0
This election has to be about reversing all of that damage.	0
That's why I'm running for office because when I become president of the United States, on my first day in office we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders.	0
When I'm president of the United States we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military.	0
And when I'm president, we're not just going to have a president that gives a State of the Union and says America is the greatest country in the world.	0
When I'm president, we're going to have a president that acts like it.	0
Thank you, senator.	0
Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address...	0
[ applause ]	0
"...appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist, quote, ""the siren call of the angriest voices""."	0
She confirmed, she was referring to you among others.	0
Was she out of line?	0
And, how would a President Trump unite the party?	0
Okay.	0
First of all, Nikki this afternoon said I'm a friend of hers.	0
Actually a close friend.	0
And wherever you are sitting Nikki, I'm a friend.	0
We're friends.	0
That's good.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But she did say there was anger.	0
And I could say, oh, I'm not angry.	0
I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.	0
Our military is a disaster.	0
[ applause ]	0
Our healthcare is a horror show.	0
Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it.	0
We have no borders.	0
Our vets are being treated horribly.	0
Illegal immigration is beyond belief.	0
Our country is being run by incompetent people.	0
And yes, I am angry.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry.	0
And I say that to Nikki.	0
So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended.	0
She said the truth.	0
One of your colleagues interviewed me.	0
And said, well, she said you were angry and I said to myself, huh, she's right.	0
I'm not fighting that.	0
I didn't find it offensive at all.	0
I'm angry because our country is a mess.	0
[ applause ]	0
But what are you going to do about it?	0
Marco Rubio.	0
I'm sorry, it's the time constraints.	0
You and Governor Christie have been exchanging some fairly nasty words of late, and I will allow the governor to respond as well.	0
The governor went so far to say, you won't be able to slime your way to the White House.	0
"He's referring to a series of ads done by a PAC, speaking on your behalf, that say quote,""One high tax, Common Core, liberal, energy-loving, Obamacare, Medicaid-expanding president is enough."	0
You think you went too far on that and do you want to apologize to the governor?	0
You know, as I said already twice in this , we have a very serious problem in this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have a president of the United States that is undermining this country's security and expanding the role of...	0
That is not my question.	0
Well, I am going to answer your question, Neil.	0
He is — this president is undermining the constitutional basis of this government.	0
This president is undermining our military.	0
He is undermining our standing in the world.	0
I like Chris Christie, but we can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports Common Core.	0
[ applause ]	0
We can not afford to have a president of the United States that supports gun control.	0
This president, this president is more interested in funding — less interested in funding the military, than he is in funding planned — he's more interested in funding Planned Parenthood than he is in funding the military.	0
Chris Christie wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.	0
All I'm saying is our next president has to be someone that undoes the damage Barack Obama has done to this country.	0
It can not be someone that agrees with his agenda.	0
Because the damage he has done to America is extraordinary.	0
Let me tell you, if we don't get this election right, there may be no turning back for America.	0
We're on the verge of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.	0
So I just truly, with all my heart belief, I like everybody on the stage.	0
No one is a socialist.	0
No one here is under FBI investigation.	0
So we have a good group of people.	0
Is he a liberal?	0
Our next president...	0
Is he a liberal?	0
Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.	1
Our next president, and our Republican nominee can not be someone who supports those positions.	0
Governor?	0
[ applause ]	0
I stood on the stage and watched Marco in rather indignantly, look at Governor Bush and say, someone told you that because we're running for the same office, that criticizing me will get you to that office.	0
It appears that the same someone who has been whispering in old Marco's ear too.	0
[ laughter ]	0
So the indignation that you carry on, some of the stuff, you have to also own then.	0
So let's set the facts straight.	0
First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor.	0
Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.	0
Third, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban.	0
I have vetoed a reduction this clip size.	0
I vetoed a statewide I.D.	0
system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.	0
And on Common Core, Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey.	0
So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator.	0
See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.	0
And you talk so much that nobody can ever keep up with what you're saying is accurate or not.	0
When you're a governor, you're held accountable for everything you do.	0
And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.	0
[ applause ]	0
And the last piece is this.	0
I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.	0
That was before he was running against me.	0
Now that he is, he's changed his tune.	0
I'm never going to change my tune.	0
I like Marco Rubio.	0
He's a good guy, a smart guy, and he would be a heck of a lot better president than Hillary Rodham Clinton would ever be.	0
[ applause ]	0
Neil, my name was mentioned here.	0
Neil, my name was mentioned as well.	0
Here's the deal, Chris is totally right.	0
He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.	0
Everybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.	0
And I think the focus ought to be on making sure that we leave this nomination process, as wild and woolly as it's going to be — this is not being bad.	0
These attack ads are going to be part of life.	0
Everybody just needs to get used to it.	0
Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.	0
[ applause ]	0
Our country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people, that unites us around our common purpose.	0
And so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the — the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.	0
Neil, I was mentioned too.	0
You were?	0
Yeah, he said everybody.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And — and I just want to take this opportunity to say, you know, in the 2012 election, you know, we — and when I say we, Republicans — tore themselves apart.	0
You know, we have to stop this because, you know, if we manage to damage ourselves, and we lose the next election, and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three Supreme Court picks, this nation is over as we know it.	0
And we got to look at the big picture here.	0
Governor Kasich...	0
[ applause ]	0
...	0
Governor Kasich, Hillary Clinton is getting some serious competition from Senator Bernie Sanders.	0
He's now at 41 percent in the latest CBS/New York Times poll.	0
Vice President Biden sang his praises, saying Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real, and he has credibility on it.	0
So what does it say about our country that a candidate who is a self-avowed socialist and who doesn't think a 90 percent tax rate is too high could be the Democratic nominee?	0
Well, if that's the case, we're going to win every state, if Bernie Sanders is the nominee.	0
That's not even an issue.	0
But look...	0
[ applause ]	0
...and I know Bernie, and I can promise you he's not going to be president of the United States.	0
So here's this — the situation, I think, Maria.	0
And this is what we have to — I — I've got to tell you, when wages don't rise — and they haven't for a lot of families for a number of years — it's very, very difficult for them.	0
Part of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need.	0
Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in — in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.	0
People are upset about it.	0
I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn.	0
Do we have answer for that?	0
We do.	0
There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds, because they've got great value.	0
I'll tell you what else people are concerned about.	0
Their kids come out of college, they have high debt and they can't get a good job.	0
We got to do a lot about the high cost of high — higher education, but we've got to make sure we're training people for jobs that exist, that are good jobs that can pay.	0
[ applause ]	0
Let me tell you that, in this country — in this country, people are concerned about their economic future.	0
They're very concerned about it.	0
And they wonder whether somebody is getting something to — keeping them from getting it.	0
That's not the America that I've ever known.	0
"My father used to say, ""Johnny, we never — we don't hate the rich."	0
"We just want to be the rich."""	0
And we just got to make sure that every American has the tools, in K-through-12 and in vocational education, in higher education.	0
And we got to fight like crazy so people can think the American dream still exists, because it does, with rising wages, with full employment and with everybody in America — and I mean everybody in America — having an opportunity to realize the American dream of having a better life than their mother and their father.	0
I'm president — look, I've done it once.	0
I've done it once in Washington, with great jobs and lower taxes.	0
The economy was really booming.	0
And now in Ohio, with the same formula, wages higher than the — than the national average.	0
A growth of 385,000 jobs.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
It's not that hard.	0
Just know where you want to go, stick to your guts.	0
Get it done, because our — our children and grandchildren are counting on us to get it done.	0
And, folks, we will.	0
You count on it.	0
Dr. Carson, one of the other candidates on this stage has brought Bill Clinton's past indiscretions.	0
Is that a legitimate topic in this election?	0
And what do you think of the notion that Hillary Clinton is an enabler of sexual misconduct?	0
Well, there's not question that we should be able to look at past president whether they're married to somebody who's running for president or not in terms of their past behavior and what it means.	0
But you know, here's the real issue, is this America anymore?	0
Do we still have standards?	0
Do we still have values and principles?	0
You know, you look at what's going on, you see all the divisiveness and the hatred that goes on in our society.	0
You know, we have a war on virtual everything — race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars.	0
Every war you can imaging, we have people at each other's throat and our strength is actually in our unity.	0
You know, you go to the internet, you start reading an article and you go to the comments section — you cannot go five comments down before people are calling each all manner of names.	0
Where did that spirit come from in America?	0
It did not come from our Judeo-Christian roots, I can tell you that.	0
And wherever it came from we need to start once again recognizing that there is such a thing as right and wrong.	0
And let's not let the secular progressives drive that out of us.	0
The majority of people in American actually have values and principles and they believe in the very things that made America great.	0
They've been beaten into submission.	0
It's time for us to stand up for what we believe in.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, we are not done.	0
Coming up, one of the top things people are talking about on Facebook, guns.	0
And you can join us live us on this stage in the conversation during this commercial break right from home.	0
You can go to Facebook.com/	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
We will be streaming live and talking about how we think the is going so far.	0
We're back in a moment in Charleston, South Carolina.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston.	0
Let's get right back to the questions.	0
Governor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month.	0
Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun.	0
What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?	0
First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the —	0
[ applause ]	0
— the Emanuel AME church killings.	0
And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.	0
[ applause ]	0
I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place.	0
Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake.	0
The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.	0
We don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.	0
Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not — would not have passed a background check.	0
The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.	0
That's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is.	0
It isn't law-abiding gun owners.	0
Look, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away.	0
You're going away for a long, long while.	0
And that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities.	0
Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.	0
The other issue is mental health.	0
That's a serious issue that we could work on.	0
Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.	0
[ applause ]	0
The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have.	0
Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Mr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?	0
No.	0
I am a 2nd amendment person.	0
If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.	0
If even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead.	0
So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.	0
We have a huge mental health problem in this country.	0
We're closing hospitals, we're closing wards, we're closing so many because the states want to save money.	0
We have to get back into looking at what's causing it.	0
The guns don't pull the trigger.	0
It's the people that pull the trigger and we have to find out what is going on.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have to protect our 2nd amendment and you cannot do this and certainly what Barack Obama was doing with the executive order.	0
He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress.	0
You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together, you do legislation.	0
He just writes out an executive order.	0
Not supposed to happen that way.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you sir.	0
You get the Congress.	0
You get the Senate.	0
You get together.	0
You do legislation.	0
He just writes out an order, executive order.	0
It's not supposed to happen that way.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, you said that President Obama wants to take people's guns away.	0
Yet under his presidency, gun sales have more than doubled.	0
That doesn't sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.	0
That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.	0
[ applause ]	0
Look, the Second Amendment is not an option.	0
It is not a suggestion.	0
It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families.	0
I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would.	0
I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would.	0
I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.	0
I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.	0
Here's my second problem.	0
None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive.	0
You know why?	0
Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show.	0
They don't buy their guns from a collector.	0
And they don't buy their guns from a gun store.	0
They get — they steal them.	0
They get them on the black market.	0
And let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.	0
These...	0
[ laughter and applause ]	0
... his answer — you name it.	0
If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control.	0
Here's a fact.	0
We are in a war against ISIS.	0
They are trying to attack us here in America.	0
They attacked us in Philadelphia last week.	0
They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago.	0
And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.	0
When I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.	0
[ applause ]	0
But what fact can you point to, Senator — what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone's gun?	0
You don't think that's	0
[ inaudible ]	0
?	0
About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns.	0
He has never defended...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...I'll give you a fact.	0
Well, let me tell you this.	0
"Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, ""These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people, and they cling to their guns and to their religion."""	0
That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.	0
This president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.	0
[ applause ]	0
He doesn't meet — here's the difference.	0
"When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not ""how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans."""	0
"It's ""give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."""	0
That will never happen when I am president of the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Christie, you, too, have criticized the president's recent executive action on gun control, saying it's unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress.	0
But hasn't your own position on guns evolved, sir?	0
"The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, ""These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws."""	0
So isn't that kind of what the president wants to do now?	0
No, absolutely not.	0
The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.	0
And the fact is that that's not a democracy.	0
That's a dictatorship.	0
And we need to very, very concerned about that.	0
See, here's the thing.	0
I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident.	0
I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat.	0
I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.	0
The fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit.	0
We have made it easier to do that, not harder.	0
And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action, not by signing unconstitutional executive orders.	0
This guy is a petulant child.	0
That's what he is.	0
I mean, you know...	0
[ applause ]	0
... the fact is, Neil, let's think about — let's think about — and I want to maybe — I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.	0
Mr. President, we're not against you.	0
We're against your policies.	0
When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate.	0
You had only 21 Republican governors in this country.	0
And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House; a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.	0
The American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it.	0
That's not right.	0
It's not constitutional.	0
And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.	0
[ applause ]	0
So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?	0
The answer is simple.	0
Your prosecute criminals.	0
You target the bad guys.	0
You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do — done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?	0
Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.	0
Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns.	1
He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.	0
He launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials.	0
And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters — the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.	0
There were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever, which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.	0
"And I'll note that California senator — Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, ""give me your guns, I'm rounding them up,"" she would."	0
And let me make a final point on this.	0
Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment.	0
Unless you are clinically insane...	0
[ laughter ]	0
...that's what you say in a primary.	0
But the voters are savvier than that.	0
They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words.	0
I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.	0
There's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race.	0
There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans — we defeated that gun control legislation.	0
And I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.	0
Senator...	0
[ applause ]	0
... let me follow up and switch gears.	0
"Senator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, ""embodies New York values."""	0
Could you explain what you mean by that?	0
You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I am from New York.	0
I don't.	0
What — what — you're from New York?	0
So you might not.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.	0
[ applause ]	0
And listen, there are many, many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York.	0
But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.	0
"And — and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked — my friend Donald has taken to it as advance playing Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"", and I was asked what I thought of that."	0
"And I said, ""well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?"""	0
And — and — you know, the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.	0
Not too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert.	0
And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.	0
"And his explanation — he said, ""look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York."	0
"Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York."""	0
And so that was his explanation.	0
And — and I guess I can — can frame it another way.	0
Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.	0
I'm just saying.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Are you sure about that?	0
Maria...	0
So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.	0
[ applause ]	0
And just so — if I could, because he insulted a lot of people.	0
I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made — New York is a great place.	0
It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.	0
When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York.	0
You had two one hundred...	0
[ applause ]	0
...you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down.	0
I saw them come down.	0
Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction.	0
I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.	0
And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death — nobody understood it.	0
And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.	0
And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers.	0
And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we've been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters.	0
The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident.	0
This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.	0
Now you've claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama.	0
I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?	0
Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military.	0
Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again.	0
It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.	0
The deployments are too high for the military personnel.	0
We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment.	0
The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman.	0
The planes are older than the pilots.	0
We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.	0
We have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.	0
Secondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board.	0
We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.	0
Thirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel...	0
[ applause ]	0
...and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.	0
We need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.	0
The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak.	0
This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran.	0
We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran's provocations, I'm wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi'ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production, some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.	0
Sure enough, oil prices have tumbled.	0
One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver's seat.	0
U.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies?	0
Do you agree?	0
Well, let me — let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience.	0
I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years, and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina.	0
Let em also tell you...	0
[ applause ]	0
...that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense.	0
And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems.	0
So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.	0
With Saudi Arabia and oil production, first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.	0
We're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country.	0
And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.	0
In terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses.	0
That is a bad deal and an evil situation, and presidents have looked the other way.	0
And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.	0
[ applause ]	0
So look, in foreign policy — in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.	0
You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.	0
And I'm going to tell you, that it — I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.	0
I've seen so much of it – a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War.	0
You see what the Saudi's — deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us.	0
And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you John.	0
There's much more ahead including the fight against ISIS.	0
More from Charleston, South Carolina when we come right back.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
We welcome back to the Republican Presidential , right back to the questions.	0
Candidates, the man who made fighting ISIS the cornerstone of his campaign, South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham is out the race but he joins us tonight in the audience.	0
[ applause ]	0
"He says, ""the air-strike now in their 16th month have been ineffective."""	0
Dr. Carson ...	0
Wait a minute, who in their 16th month?	0
The air-strikes.	0
OK.	0
Now in their 16th month are ineffective.	0
Dr. Carson, do you think Senator Graham is right in wanting to send 20,000 troops — ground troops to Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS?	0
Well, there's no question that ISIS is a very serious problem, and I don't believe that this administration recognizes how serious it is.	0
I think we need to do a lot more than we're doing.	0
Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.	0
"The way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them, ""what do you need in order to accomplish this goal?"""	0
Our decision is, then, do we give them what we need.	0
I say, yes, not only do we give them what they need, but we don't tie their hands behind their backs so that they can go ahead and get the job done.	0
In addition to that...	0
[ applause ]	0
...in addition to that, we go ahead and we take the oil from them, their source of revenue.	0
"You know, some of these — these engagement rules that the administration has — ""we're not going to bomb a tanker that's coming out of there because there might be a person in it"" — give me a break."	0
Just tell them that, you put people in there, we're going to bomb them.	0
So don't put people in there if you don't want them bombed.	0
You know, that's so simple.	0
[ applause ]	0
And then we need to shut down — we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command-and-control centers.	0
Why should we let their people be sitting there smoking their cigars, sitting in their comfortable chairs in Raqqa?	0
We know to go ahead and shut off the supply routes, and send in our special ops at 2:00 a.m. and attack them everywhere they go.	0
They should be running all the time, then they won't have time to plan attacks against us.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Senator Graham has also said that the U.S. will find Arab support for its coalition if it removes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.	0
"And I quote, ""The now king of Saudi Arabia told us, 'you can have our army, you just got to deal with Assad.'"	0
The emir of Qatar said, 'I'll pay for the operation, but they are not going to fight ISIS and let Damascus fall into the hands of the Iranians.	0
Assad has to go.'	0
Governor Christie, how important is it to remove Assad from power and how would you do it?	0
Maria, you look at what this president and his secretary of state, Secretary of State Clinton, has done to get us in this spot.	0
You think about it — this is the president who said, along with his secretary of state — drew a red line in Syria, said, if Assad uses chemical weapons against his people, that we're going to attack.	0
He used chemical weapons, he's killed, now, over a quarter of a million of his own people, and this president has done nothing.	0
In fact, he's done worse than nothing.	0
This president — and, by the way, Secretary Clinton, who called Assad a reformer — she called Assad a reformer.	0
Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?	0
We have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad.	0
The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace — we are not going to have peace in Syria.	0
We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.	0
The Syrians should stay in Syria.	0
They shouldn't be going to Europe.	0
And here's the last piece...	0
[ applause ]	0
...you're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in charge.	0
You're simply not.	0
And so Senator Graham is right about this.	0
And if we want to try to rebuild the coalition, as Governor Kasich was saying before, then what we better do is to get to the Arab countries that believe that ISIS is a threat, not only to them, but to us and to world peace, and bring them together.	0
And believe me, Assad is not worth it.	0
And if you're going to leave this to Hillary Clinton, the person who gave us this foreign policy, the architect of it, and you're going to give her another four years, that's why I'm speaking out as strongly as I am about that.	0
Hillary Clinton cannot be president.	0
It will lead to even greater war in this world.	0
And remember this, after Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have had nearly 8 years, we have fewer democracies in the world than we had when they started.	0
That makes the world less peaceful, less safe.	0
In my administration, we will help to make sure we bring people together in the Middle East, and we will fight ISIS and defeat them.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump — Mr. Trump, your comments about banning Muslims from entering the country created a firestorm.	0
According to Facebook, it was the most-talked-about moment online of your entire campaign, with more than 10 million people talking about the issue.	0
Is there anything you've heard that makes you want to rethink this position?	0
No.	0
[ laughter ]	0
No.	0
[ applause ]	0
Look, we have to stop with political correctness.	0
We have to get down to creating a country that's not going to have the kind of problems that we've had with people flying planes into the World Trade Centers, with the — with the shootings in California, with all the problems all over the world.	0
I just left Indonesia — bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.	0
We have to find out what's going on.	0
I said temporarily.	0
I didn't say permanently.	0
I said temporarily.	0
And I have many great Muslim friends.	0
"And some of them, I will say, not all, have called me and said, ""Donald, thank you very much; you're exposing an unbelievable problem and we have to get to the bottom of it."""	0
And unlike President Obama, where he refuses even to use the term of what's going on, he can't use the term for whatever reason.	0
And if you can't use the term, you're never going to solve the problem.	0
"My Muslim friends, some, said, ""thank you very much; we'll get to the bottom of it."""	0
But we have a serious problem.	0
And we can't be the stupid country any more.	0
We're laughed at all over the world.	0
[ applause ]	0
Donald, Donald — can I — I hope you reconsider this, because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS.	0
The Kurds are our strongest allies.	0
They're Muslim.	0
You're not going to even allow them to come to our country?	0
The other Arab countries have a role to play in this.	0
We cannot be the world's policeman.	0
We can't do this unilaterally.	0
We have to do this in unison with the Arab world.	0
And sending that signal makes it impossible for us to be serious about taking out ISIS and restoring democracy in Syria.	0
[ applause ]	0
So I hope you'll reconsider.	0
I hope you'll reconsider.	0
The better way of dealing with this — the better way of dealing with this is recognizing that there are people in, you know, the — Islamic terrorists inside, embedded in refugee populations.	0
What we ought to do is tighten up our efforts to deal with the entry visa program so that a citizen from Europe, it's harder if they've been traveling to Syria or traveling to these other places where there is Islamic terrorism, make it harder — make the screening take place.	0
We don't have to have refugees come to our country, but all Muslims, seriously?	0
What kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the United States is a serious player in creating peace and security?	0
But you said — you said that he made those comments and they represented him being unhinged after he made them.	0
Yeah, they are unhinged.	0
Well — well, after he made them...	0
[ applause ]	0
...his poll numbers went up eight points in South Carolina.	0
Now — now, wait...	0
Eleven points, to be exact.	0
Are you — are you saying — are you saying that all those people who agree with Mr. Trump are unhinged?	0
No, not at all, absolutely not.	0
I can see why people are angry and scared, because this president has created a condition where our national security has weakened dramatically.	0
I totally get that.	0
But we're running for the presidency of the United States here.	0
This isn't — this isn't, you know, a different kind of job.	0
You have to lead.	0
You cannot make rash statements and expect the rest of the world to respond as though, well, it's just politics.	0
Every time we send signals like this, we send a signal of weakness, not strength.	0
And so it was	0
[ inaudible ]	0
his statement, which is why I'm asking him to consider changing his views.	0
[ applause ]	0
I want security for this country.	0
OK?	0
[ applause ]	0
I want security.	0
I'm tired of seeing what's going on, between the border where the people flow over; people come in; they live; they shoot.	0
I want security for this country.	0
We have a serious problem with, as you know, with radical Islam.	0
We have a tremendous problem.	0
It's not only a problem here.	0
It's a problem all over the world.	0
I want to find out why those two young people — those two horrible young people in California when they shot the 14 people, killed them — people they knew, people that held the wedding reception for them.	0
I want to find out — many people saw pipe bombs and all sorts of things all over their apartment.	0
Why weren't they vigilant?	0
Why didn't they call?	0
Why didn't they call the police?	0
And by the way, the police are the most mistreated people in this country.	0
I will tell you that.	0
[ applause ]	0
The most mistreated people.	0
In fact, we need to — wait a minute — we need vigilance.	0
We have to find out — many people knew about what was going on.	0
Why didn't they turn those two people in so that you wouldn't have had all the death?	0
There's something going on and it's bad.	0
And I'm saying we have to get to the bottom of it.	0
That's all I'm saying.	0
We need security.	0
We — we want to hear from all of you on this.	0
According to Pew Research, the U.S. admits more than 100,000 Muslim immigrants every single year on a permanent lifetime basis.	0
I want to ask the rest of you to comment on this.	0
Do you agree that we should pause Muslim immigration until we get a better handle on our homeland security situation, as Mr. Trump has said?	0
Beginning with you, Governor Kasich.	0
I — I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian refugees.	0
And the reasons why I've done is I don't believe we have a good process of being able to vet them.	0
But you know, we don't want to put everybody in the same category.	0
And I'll go back to something that had been mentioned just a few minutes ago.	0
If we're going to have a coalition, we're going to have to have a coalition not just of people in the western part of the world, our European allies, but we need the Saudis, we need the Egyptians, we need the Jordanians, we need the Gulf states.	0
We need Jordan.	0
We need all of them to be part of exactly what the first George Bush put together in the first Gulf War.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
It was a coalition made up of Arabs and Americans and westerners and we're going to need it again.	0
And if we try to put everybody in the same — call everybody the same thing, we can't do it.	0
And that's just not acceptable.	0
But I think a pause on Syrian refugees has been exactly right for all the governors that have called for it, and also, of course, for me as the governor of Ohio.	0
Thank you, sir, we want to hear from the rest of you,	0
Governor Christie, your take.	0
Now Maria, listen.	0
I said right from the beginning that we should take no Syrian refugees of any kind.	0
And the reason I said that is because the FBI director told the American people, told Congress, that he could not guarantee he could vet them and it would be safe.	0
That's the end of the conversation.	0
I can tell you, after spending seven years as a former federal prosecutor, right after 9/11, dealing with this issue.	0
Here's the way you need to deal with it.	0
You can't just ban all Muslims.	0
You have to ban radical Islamic jihadists.	0
You have to ban the people who are trying to hurt us.	0
The only way to figure that out is to go back to getting the intelligence community the funding and the tools that it needs to be able to keep America safe.	0
[ bell rings ]	0
And this summer, we didn't do that.	0
We took it away from the NSA, it was a bad decision by the president.	0
Bad by those in the Senate who voted for it and if I'm president, we'll make our intelligence community strong, and won't have to keep everybody out, we're just going to keep the bad folk out and make sure they don't harm us.	0
Senator Rubio, where do you stand?	0
Well, first of all, let's understand why we are even having this and why Donald tapped in to some of that anger that's out there about this whole issue.	0
Because this president has consistently underestimated the threat of ISIS.	0
If you listen to the State of the Union the other night, he described them as a bunch of guys with long beards on the back of a pickup truck.	0
They are much more than that.	0
This is a group of people that enslaves women and sells them, sells them as brides.	0
This is a group of people that burns people in cages, that is conducting genocide against Christians and Yazidis and others in the region.	0
This is not some small scale group.	0
They are radicalizing people in the United States, they are conducting attacks around the world.	0
So you know what needs to happen, it's a very simple equation, and it's going to happen when I'm president.	0
If we do not know who you are, and we do not know why you are coming when I am president, you are not getting into the United States of America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Cruz, where do you stand?	0
Senator Cruz?	0
You know I understand why Donald made the comments he did and I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism.	0
I think what we need is a commander in chief who is focused like a laser on keeping this country safe and on defeating radical Islamic terrorism.	0
What should we do?	0
First, we should pass the Expatriate Terrorist Act, legislation I've introduced that says if an American goes and joins ISIS and wages jihad against America, that you forfeit your citizenship and you can not come in on a passport.	0
[ applause ]	0
And secondly, we should pass the legislation that I've introduced...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...that suspends all refugees from nations that ISIS or Al Qaida controls significant territory.	0
Just last week, we see saw two Iraqi refugees vetted using the same process the president says will work, that were arrested for being alleged ISIS terrorists.	0
If I'm elected president, we will not let in refugees from countries controlled by ISIS or Al Qaida.	0
When it comes to ISIS, we will not weaken them, we will not degrade them, we will utterly and completely destroy ISIS	0
[ applause ]	0
.	0
Dr. Carson, where do you stand?	0
Do you agree with Mr. Trump?	0
Well, first of all, recognize it is a substantial problem.	0
But like all of our problems, there isn't a single one that can't be solved with common sense if you remove the ego and the politics.	0
And clearly, what we need to do is get a group of experts together, including people from other countries, some of our friends from Israel, who have had experience screening these people and come up with new guidelines for immigration, and for visas, for people who are coming into this country.	0
That is the thing that obviously makes sense, we can do that.	0
And as far as the Syrians are concerned, Al-Hasakah province, perfect place.	0
They have infrastructure.	0
All we need to do is protect them, they will be in their own country.	0
And that is what they told me when I was in Jordan in November.	0
Let's listen to them and let's not listen to our politicians.	0
So, to be clear, the both of you do not agree with Mr. Trump?	0
So, are we going to ban Muslims from India, from Indonesia, from countries that are strong allies — that we need to build better relationships with?	0
Of course not.	0
What we need to do is destroy ISIS.	0
"I laid out a plan at the Citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a ""No Fly Zone"" and ""Safe Zones"" to make sure refugees are there."	0
We need to lead a force, a Sunni led force inside of Syria.	0
We need to embed with — with the Iraqi military.	0
We need to arm the Kurds the directly.	0
We need to re-establish the relationships with the Sunnis.	0
We need the lawyers off the back of the war fighters.	0
That's how you solve the problem.	0
You don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all Muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful.	0
Thank you governor.	0
Mr. Trump, sometimes maybe in the heat of the campaign, you say things and you have to dial them back.	0
"Last week, the New York Times editorial board quoted as saying that you would oppose, ""up to 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods."""	0
That's wrong.	0
They were wrong.	0
It's the New York Times, they are always wrong.	0
Well...	0
They were wrong.	0
You never said because they provided that...	0
"No, I said, "" I would use — "" they were asking me what to do about North Korea."	0
China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control — just about, of North Korea.	0
They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.	0
"They say, "" well, we don't really have control."""	0
Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat.	0
China is ripping us on trade.	0
They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies.	0
Thousands of thousands — you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost — 50,000 because of China.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
So they've never said to put a tariff on their...	0
We've lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China.	0
"What I said then was, ""we have very unfair trade with China."	0
"We're going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China."""	0
A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.	0
"What I said to the New York Times, is that, ""we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount — where the 45 percent comes in, that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get."""	0
That we should get.	0
What I'm saying is this, I'm saying that we do it but if they don't start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don't lose all of these millions of jobs that we're losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China.	0
Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?	0
I'm sorry, you lost me.	0
It's not that complicated actually.	0
Then I apologize.	0
Then I want to understand, if you don't want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn't the figure, would you be open — are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?	0
OK, just so you understand — I know so much about trading about with China.	0
Carl Icahn today as you know endorsed.	0
Many businessmen want to endorse me.	0
I know...	0
"Carl said, ""no, no — "" but he's somebody — these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this."	0
If these are the kinds of people — we should use our best and our finest.	0
Now, on that tariff — here's what I'm saying, China — they send their goods and we don't tax it — they do whatever they want to do.	0
They do whatever what they do, OK.	0
When we do business with China, they tax us.	0
You don't know it, they tax us.	0
I have many friends that deal with China.	0
They can't — when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed.	0
If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal — so we don't have an equal playing field.	0
I'm saying, absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China.	0
I'm a free trader.	0
I believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate.	0
I have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine.	0
I sell tens' of millions of	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
I love China.	0
I love the Chinese people but they laugh themselves, they can't believe how stupid the American leadership is.	0
So you're open to a tariff?	0
I'm totally open to a tariff.	0
If they don't treat us fairly, hey, their whole trade is tariffed.	0
You can't deal in China without tariffs.	0
They do it to us, we don't it.	0
It's not fair trade.	0
Neil, Neil — can I say one thing about this.	0
I'm a free trader.	0
I support NAFTA.	0
I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.	0
And we do need China — Donald's right about North Korea.	0
I mean the fact is, is that they need to put the pressure on and frankly we need to intercepts ships coming out of North Korea so they don't proliferate all these dangerous materials.	0
But what he's touching — talking about, I think has got merit.	0
And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...	0
I'm happy to have him tonight...	0
[ laughter ]	0
For too long — no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.	0
And guess what?	0
The worker's out of a job.	0
So when they — be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them, then what do we tell the worker?	0
Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.	0
I think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade.	0
And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need — we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.	0
And I want to just suggest to you.	0
How do I know this?	0
Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar.	0
And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.	0
So let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country.	0
That's what I think we need to do.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
But on this point, if I may add something on this point.	0
We are all frustrated with what China is doing.	0
I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.	0
China doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff.	0
If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.	0
So I think the better approach, the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.	0
It begins with tax reform.	0
Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world.	0
Let's allow companies to immediately expense.	0
[ applause ]	0
It continues with regulatory reform.	0
Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.	0
How about Obamacare, a certified job killer?	0
It needs to be repealed and replaced.	0
And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger.	0
That is the way to deal with China at the end of the day.	0
Neil, the problem...	0
We're getting...	0
... with what Marco is saying is that it takes too long, they're sucking us dry and it takes too long.	0
It would just — you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money.	0
We just can't do it any longer.	0
He is right.	0
If you put a tariff on a good, it's Americans who pay.	0
Absolutely.	0
You looking at me?	0
Yeah.	0
Prices go higher for...	0
Can I tell you what?	0
It will never happen because they'll let their currency go up.	0
They're never going to let it happen.	0
Japan, the same thing.	0
They are devaluing — it's so impossible for — you look at Caterpillar Tractor and what's happening with Caterpillar and Kamatsu.	0
Kamatsu is a tractor company in Japan.	0
Friends of mine are ordering Kamatsu tractors now because they've de-valued the yen to such an extent that you can't buy a Caterpillar tractor.	0
And we're letting them get away with it and we can't let them get away with it.	0
And that's why we have to use Carl and we have to use our great businesspeople and not political hacks to negotiate with these guys.	0
[ applause ]	0
Here's — apart from the — apart from the higher prices on consumers and people are living paycheck to paycheck, apart from that, there will be retaliation.	0
Yeah.	0
So they soybean sales from Iowa, entire soybean production goes — the equivalent of it goes to China.	0
Or how about Boeing right here within a mile?	0
Do you think that the Chinese, if they had a 45 percent tariff imposed on all their imports wouldn't retaliate and start buying Airbus?	0
Of course, they would.	0
This would be devastating for the economy.	0
We need someone with a steady hand being president of the United States.	0
Real quick, Senator — go ahead, Senator Cruz.	0
[ applause ]	0
And then we have to get to tax reform.	0
And we don't need a weak person being president of the United State, OK?	0
Because that's what we'd get if it were Jeb — I tell you what, we don't need that.	0
Boo.	0
We don't need that.	0
That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.	0
And that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now.	0
And by the way, Jeb you mentioned Boeing, take a look.	0
They order planes, they make Boeing build their plant in China.	0
They don't want them made here.	0
They want those planes made in China.	0
They're a mile away from here.	0
That's not the way the game is supposed to be played.	0
Thank you, Governor Bush.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
Very briefly.	0
My name was mentioned.	0
My name was mentioned here.	0
The simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to China.	0
You can — if you — you flew in with your 767, didn't you?	0
Right there, right next to the plant.	0
No, the new planes.	0
I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about in the future they're building massive plants in China because China does not want Boeing building their planes here, they want them built in China, because China happens to be smart the way they do it, not the way we do it.	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
When you head back to airport tonight, go check and see what the...	0
Thank you, Mr. Trmup.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
I'll check for you.	0
Check it out.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Senator briefly.	0
Thanks for coming back to me, Maria.	0
Both Donald and Jeb have good points, and there is a middle ground.	0
Donald is right that China is running over President Obama like he is a child, President Obama is not protecting American workers and we are getting hammered.	0
You know, I sat down with the senior leadership of John Deere.	0
They discussed how — how hard it is to sell tractors in China, because all the regulatory barriers.	0
They're protectionist.	0
But Jeb is also right that, if we just impose a tariff, they'll put reciprocal tariffs, which will hurt Iowa farmers and South Carolina producers and 20 percent of the American jobs that depend on exports.	0
So the way you do it is you pass a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced: a simple flat tax, 10 percent for individuals, and a 16 percent business flat tax, you abolish the IRS...	0
[ applause ]	0
...and here's the critical point, Maria — the business flat tax enables us to abolish the corporate income tax, the death tax, the Obamacare taxes, the payroll taxes, and they're border-adjustable, so every export pays no taxes whatsoever.	0
It's tax-free — a huge advantage for our farmers and ranchers and manufacturers — and every import pays the 16 percent business flat tax.	0
It's like a tariff, but here's the difference: if we impose a tariff, China responds.	0
The business flat tax, they already impose their taxes on us, so there's no reciprocal...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...tariffs that come against us.	0
It puts us on a level, even playing field, which brings jobs here at home...	0
Maria...	0
... and as president, I'm going to fight for the working men and women.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
We've got to get to tax reform, gentlemen.	0
We've got to get to tax reform, and we've got to get to the...	0
Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.	0
... we've got to get to the national debt as well.	0
Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform.	0
More from North Charleston, South Carolina, when we come right back.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential here in North Charleston.	0
Right back to the questions.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt.	0
But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.	0
Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs.	0
What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?	0
Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.	0
Here's — here's our plan.	0
We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.	0
If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world — and we double tax, as you know.	0
And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.	0
And who can blame them?	0
They pay tax once overseas.	0
They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.	0
So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given — bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.	0
Bring the money — the $2 trillion — back to the United States.	0
We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.	0
And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.	0
It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.	0
It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.	0
And — and — and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.	0
You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.	0
He's penalized — and doesn't understand.	0
In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.	0
You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.	0
That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.	0
We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.	0
And remember this — I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.	0
We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.	0
We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.	0
All of those things are important, and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Dr. Carson...	0
[ applause ]	0
...it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now.	0
That could be used for investment and jobs in America.	0
Also, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes.	0
What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?	0
Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed.	0
A flat tax for everybody — no exemptions, no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.	0
You know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money.	0
You know, I — my — my mother taught me this.	0
You know, she only had a third-grade education, but — you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.	0
I mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car.	0
In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.	0
But...	0
[ laughter ]	0
... you know, the — the — the fact of the matter is — you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations — because every regulation is a tax, it's a — on goods and services.	0
And it's the most regressive tax there is.	0
You know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up — you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that.	0
A rich person does not.	0
Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.	0
And everything is costing more money, and we are killing our — our — our people like this.	0
And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.	0
It's not the evil rich people.	0
It's the evil government that is — that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, sir.	0
Senator Rubio...	0
Maria — Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion.	0
It's one of the biggest problems our country has.	0
Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs — leave them behind.	0
They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees, Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in.	0
But they can't get along.	0
They can't even make a deal.	0
Here is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal.	0
We have to do something.	0
Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have.	0
So many companies are going to leave our country.	0
Which is why we raised it.	0
Senator Rubio?	0
Thank you, Mr. Trump.	0
Thank you.	0
One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare.	0
What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?	0
Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.	0
[ applause ]	0
Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.	0
I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.	0
It's called the value added tax.	0
And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.	0
Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.	0
And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.	0
Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.	0
Now, you can support one now that's very low.	0
But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.	0
Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.	0
And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.	0
When I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you senator.	0
Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.	0
Senator Cruz, yes.	0
You were meant to.	0
Yes, of course.	0
Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.	0
A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.	0
This is a business flat tax.	0
It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.	0
It goes away.	0
It enables us to eliminate the death tax.	0
If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.	0
We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.	0
And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.	0
Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.	0
Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.	0
My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS.	0
Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.	0
We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...the mandates and have a simple flat tax.	0
The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.	0
I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.	0
Thank you senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
But that's not an accurate description of the plan.	0
Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.	0
Someone's going to be collecting this tax.	0
In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?	0
That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.	0
The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.	0
Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.	0
They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.	0
So there are people watching tonight in business.	0
If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?	0
You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.	0
And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.	0
You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.	0
Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.	0
But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...and they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent.	0
Now, you've got Europe.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Thank you senator.	0
I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.	0
Maria...	0
Yes.	0
Maria, I'd just like to say...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Maria, I'd like to interrupt this on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements.	0
Do you remember that, everybody?	0
This was a question on entitlements.	0
And the reason — and the reason...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it.	0
Here's the thing.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
The fact is, the reason why...	0
If you'll answer the	0
[ inaudible ]	0
core question.	0
... the fact is — the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard.	0
It's a hard problem.	0
And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this — avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.	0
Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.	0
Bernie Sanders has already said it.	0
And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.	0
We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress — this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.	0
A Republican Congress did that.	0
And the fact is it was wrong.	0
And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security.	0
We need to reform Social Security.	0
Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
Can I just add one very quick thing?	0
And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan.	0
And multiple reputable journals, including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best.	0
Just want to get that out there, just saying.	0
Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
Coming up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it.	0

Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business.	0
Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president?	0
With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America's interest first?	0
Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company.	0
As you too know, I know I built a very great company.	0
But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company.	0
It's peanuts.	0
I want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again.	0
I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.	0
Run the company kids, have a good time.	0
I'm going to do it for America.	0
So I would — I would be willing to do that.	0
So you'll put your assets in a blind trust?	0
I would put it in a blind trust.	0
Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.	0
If that's a blind trust, I don't know.	0
But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.	0
Thank you sir.	0
Thank you.	0
Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy.	0
So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country.	0
"Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, ""most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington."""	0
"Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, ""police are being less proactive because they're being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they're afraid of being sued or thrown in jail."""	0
What would you do as president to address this?	0
Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.	0
He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan.	0
"He said, ""there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country."""	0
Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.	0
That's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president.	0
Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to — remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.	0
This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.	0
Now, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey.	0
I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country.	0
That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws.	0
And this president turns his back — this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.	0
And he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal.	0
This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.	0
Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General.	0
"I'd say, ""General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively."	0
Make our streets safe again.	0
"Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them."""	0
We do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well.	0
I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.	0
Thank you governor.	0
Governor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago's move recently to sort of retrain police?	0
Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?	0
Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat.	0
She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.	0
And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.	0
And they came back with 23 recommendations.	0
One of them is a statewide use of deadly force.	0
And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio.	0
Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for — for training.	0
But let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police.	0
Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not — not to lose their life.	0
Their family is waiting for them.	0
At the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them, but works against them.	0
See, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions.	0
But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong.	0
And it has been a remarkable situation in our state.	0
And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks.	0
It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.	0
And when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have.	0
Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed.	0
I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight, but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone.	0
You've got to bring people together.	0
You've got to give people hope.	0
And together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America.	0
And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Rubio?	0
[ applause ]	0
Under current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina.	0
The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.	0
Why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?	0
Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years.	0
And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job.	0
This issue is not about that anymore.	0
First and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.	0
And here's why.	0
There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.	0
And not just green cards.	0
They're looking — they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances.	0
They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.	0
They're looking — they're looking to manipulate our — the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States.	0
So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States.	0
So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming, you are not going to get into the United States of America.	0
So your thinking has changed?	0
The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago.	0
Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.	0
They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.	0
The entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost, with an eye on ISIS.	0
Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees.	0
We know this for a fact.	0
They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border.	0
And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.	0
This issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.	0
We had Boko Haram.	0
We had Hamas.	0
We had Hezbollah.	0
We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America.	0
It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees.	0
It enabled him — the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.	0
I think that's a mistake.	0
That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it.	0
And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries.	0
I voted yes to suspend that.	0
Marco voted on the other side.	0
So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.	0
Maria, let me clear something up here.	0
This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.	0
Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it.	0
You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it.	0
You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it.	0
You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.	1
And by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it.	0
I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa, and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.	0
[ applause ]	0
That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation.	0
When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant.	0
Edward Snowden is a traitor.	0
And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.	0
[ applause ]	0
And one more point, one more point.	0
Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.	0
Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.	0
In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.	1
Here's the bottom line, and I'll close with this.	0
If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.	0
[ applause ]	0
There's — look, there's —	0
Gentlemen, gentlemen —	0
I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.	0
There's no way he launches 11 attack —	0
Very quick, very quick.	0
I'm going to — he had no fewer than 11 attacks there.	0
I appreciate your dumping your	0
[ inaudible ]	0
research folder on the stage.	0
No, it's your record.	0
But I will say —	0
Do you think they like each other?	0
— at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false.	0
They're absolutely false.	0
Boo.	0
So let's start — let's start with immigration.	0
Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity.	0
Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.	0
I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King.	0
Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals.	0
I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.	0
And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.	1
What he said, and he said it in the last, it's simply not true.	0
And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.	0
All right, gentlemen, we've got to stop.	0
I know you are very passionate about that.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush, fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks.	0
Since our last , the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.	0
Now this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large.	0
The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication.	0
Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period.	0
Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?	0
I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators — back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.	0
The simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country.	0
We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff —	0
Would you answer this question?	0
Oh, I'll talk about that, too.	0
But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Fair enough.	0
So Tim Cook — so Tim Cook says he's going to keep it private.	0
I got that.	0
And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C.	0
There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies.	0
They understand that there's a national security risk.	0
We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.	0
We need to make sure that we keep the country safe.	0
This is the first priority.	0
The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely.	0
Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is — that is just shameful.	0
23 million files in the hands of the Chinese?	0
So it's not just the government — the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.	0
We should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.	0
That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.	0
But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.	0
You've got to keep asking.	0
You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue.	0
If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship —	0
Do you ask or do you order?	0
Well, if the law would change, yeah.	0
But I think there has to be recognition that if we — if we are too punitive, then you'll go to other — other technology companies outside the United States.	0
And what we want to do is to control this.	0
We also want to dominate this from a commercial side.	0
So there's a lot of balanced interests.	0
But the president leads in this regard.	0
That's what we need.	0
We need leadership, someone who has a backbone and sticks with things, rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed.	0
Governor, thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
When we come right back, closing statements.	0
Stay with us.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back.	0
Candidates, it is time for your closing statements.	0
You get 60 seconds each.	0
Governor John Kasich, we begin with you.	0
You know, in our country, there are a lot of people who feel as though they just don't have the power.	0
You know, they feel like if they don't have a lobbyist, if they're not wealthy, that somehow they don't get to play.	0
But all of my career, you know, having been raised in — by a mailman father whose father was a coal miner, who died of black lung and was losing his eyesight; or a mother whose mother could barely speak English.	0
You see, all of my career, I've fought about giving voice to the people that I grew up with and voice to the people that elected me.	0
Whether it's welfare reform and getting something back for the hard-earned taxpayers; whether it's engaging in Pentagon reform and taking on the big contractors that were charging thousands of dollars for hammers and screw drivers and ripping us off; or whether it's taking on the special interests in the nursing home industry in Ohio, so that mom and dad can have the ability to stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.	0
Look, that's who I stand up for.	0
That's who's in my mind...	0
[ bell rings ]	0
...And if you really want to believe that you can get your voice back, I will tell you, as I have all my career, I will continue to fight for you, because you're the ones that built this country, and will carry it into the future.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Bush?	0
Who can you count on to keep us safer, stronger and freer?	0
Results count, and as governor, I pushed Florida up to the top in terms of jobs, income and small business growth.	0
Detailed plans count, and I believe that the plan I've laid out to destroy ISIS before the tragedies of San Bernardino and Paris are the right ones.	0
Credibility counts.	0
There'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do.	0
I've done it.	0
I ask for your support to build, together, a safer and stronger America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Chris Christie?	0
Maria, Neil, thank you for a great tonight.	0
When I think about the folks who are out there at home tonight watching, and I think about what they had to watch this week — the spectacle they had to watch on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the president of the United States, who talked a fantasy land about the way they're feeling.	0
They know that this country is not respected around the world anymore.	0
They know that this country is pushing the middle class, the hardworking taxpayers, backwards, and they saw a president who doesn't understand their pain, and doesn't have any plan for getting away from it.	0
I love this country.	0
It's the most exceptional country the world has ever known.	0
We need someone to fight for the people.	0
We need a fighter for this country again.	0
I've lived my whole life fighting — fighting for things that I believe in, fighting for justice and to protect people from crime and terrorism, fighting to stand up for folks who have not had enough and need an opportunity to get more, and to stand up and fight against the special interests.	0
But here's the best way that we're going to make America much more exceptional: it is to make sure we put someone on that stage in September who will fight Hillary Clinton and make sure she never, ever gets in the White House again.	0
I am the man who can bring us together to do that, and I ask for your vote.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Ben Carson?	0
You know, in recent travels around this country, I've encountered so many Americans who are discouraged and angry as they watch our freedom, our security and the American dream slipping away under an unresponsive government that is populated by bureaucrats and special interest groups.	0
We're not going to solve this problem with traditional politics.	0
The only way we're going to solve this problem is with we, the people.	0
And I ask you to join me in truth and honesty and integrity.	0
Bencarson.com — we will heal, inspire and revive America for our children.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Marco Rubio?	0
You know, 200 years ago, America was founded on this powerful principle that our rights don't come from government.	0
Our rights come from God.	0
That's why we embraced free enterprise, and it made us the most prosperous people in the history of the world.	0
That's why we embraced individual liberty, and we became the freest people ever, and the result was the American miracle.	0
But now as I travel the country, people say what I feel.	0
This country is changing.	0
It feels different.	0
We feel like we're being left behind and left out.	0
And the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.	0
We elected someone as president who wants to change America, who wants to make it more like the rest of the world.	0
And so he undermines the Constitution, and he undermines free enterprise by expanding government, and he betrays our allies and cuts deals with our enemies and guts our military.	0
And that's why 2016 is a turning point in our history.	0
If we elect Hillary Clinton, the next four years will be worse than the last eight, and our children will be the first Americans ever to inherit a diminished country.	0
But if we elect the right person — if you elect me — we will turn this country around, we will reclaim the American dream and this nation will be stronger and greater than it has ever been.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Ted Cruz?	0
13 Hours — tomorrow morning, a new movie will debut about the incredible bravery of the men fighting for their lives in Benghazi and the politicians that abandoned them.	0
I want to speak to all our fighting men and women.	0
I want to speak to all the moms and dads whose sons and daughters are fighting for this country, and the incredible sense of betrayal when you have a commander-in-chief who will not even speak the name of our enemy, radical Islamic terrorism, when you have a commander-in- chief who sends $150 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who's responsible for murdering hundreds of our servicemen and women.	0
I want to speak to all of those maddened by political correctness, where Hillary Clinton apologizes for saying all lives matter.	0
This will end.	0
It will end on January 2017.	0
And if I am elected president, to every soldier and sailor and airman and marine, and to every police officer and firefighter and first responder who risk their lives to keep us safe, I will have your back.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Donald Trump?	0
I stood yesterday with 75 construction workers.	0
They're tough, they're strong, they're great people.	0
Half of them had tears pouring down their face.	0
They were watching the humiliation of our young ten sailors, sitting on the floor with their knees in a begging position, their hands up.	0
And Iranian wise guys having guns to their heads.	0
It was a terrible sight.	0
A terrible sight.	0
And the only reason we got them back is because we owed them with a stupid deal, $150 billion.	0
If I'm president, there won't be stupid deals anymore.	0
We will make America great again.	0
We will win on everything we do.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Candidates, thank you.	0
Gentlemen, thank you all.	0
All of you.	0
That wraps up our debate.	0
We went a little bit over here.	0
But we wanted to make sure everyone was able to say their due.	0
He's upset.	0
All right.	0
Thank you for joining us.	0
Much more to come in the Spin Room ahead.	0
Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidate's debate.	0
After all the campaigning, soon, Americans will have their say with the first votes of the 2016 campaign just 15 days away in Iowa.	0
And New Hampshire not far behind.	0
Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins.	0
Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates.	0
So let's get started.	0
Please welcome Secretary Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Martin O'Malley.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, welcome to all of you.	0
Hope you're excited, we're excited.	0
We want to thank our hosts, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute.	0
I'm joined by my colleague Andrea Mitchell tonight.	0
The rules are simple.	0
Sixty seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups or rebuttals.	0
I know you'll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight.	0
We'll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.	0
This is a critical point in the race.	0
You've been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail.	0
We're here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight.	0
Let's have a great debate.	0
We'll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.	0
Well, good evening.	0
And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.	0
You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King.	0
I was a teenager.	0
And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service.	0
I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.	0
And that is our fight still.	0
We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind.	0
We have to keep our communities and our country safe.	0
We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.	0
I understand that this is the hardest job in the world.	0
I'm prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.	0
Thank you.	0
As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it's important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country.	0
As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that's rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.	0
And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.	0
This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
And Governor O'Malley, your opening statement, sir.	0
Thank you.	0
"My name is Martin O'Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his ""I Have A Dream"" speech."	0
And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.	0
You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King's teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.	0
Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression.	0
And that's what he's done.	0
Our country's doing better, we're creating jobs again.	0
But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.	0
We need new leadership.	0
We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.	0
That's why I'm running for president.	0
I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.	0
Thank you.	0
All right.	0
And Governor, thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
All right, to our first question, now.	0
The first question, I'll be addressing to all of the candidates.	0
President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform.	0
Voters want to know how you would define your presidency?	0
How would you think big?	0
So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be — fill in the blank.	0
Senator Sanders.	0
Well, that's what our campaign is about.	0
It is thinking big.	0
It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.	0
So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.	0
I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women's work.	0
I would also...	0
[ applause ]	0
...I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn't take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.	0
And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together.	0
We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness.	0
There's a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together.	0
That's how we'll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor O'Malley, same question.	0
Thank you.	0
First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down.	0
Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.	0
Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change.	0
And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
You've all...	0
Finally — I'm sorry, that was second, Lester.	0
And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America's cities.	0
We have not had a new agenda for America's cities since Jimmy Carter.	0
We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.	0
All right governor thank you.	0
We've all laid out large visions and we're going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening.	0
The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race.	0
Let's start with one of them, the issue of guns.	0
"Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, ""a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby."""	0
Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?	0
Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous.	0
I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.	0
I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.	0
I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns.	0
And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable.	0
I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant.	0
We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people.	0
This should not be a political issue.	0
What we should be doing is working together.	0
And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...	0
Senator, but you didn't answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers.	0
So can you...	0
What I have said, is that gun manufacturer's liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we've prohibited ammunition that would've killed cops who had protection on.	0
We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation.	0
"And what we also said, ""is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun."""	0
"So what I said is, "" I would re-look at it."""	0
We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.	0
Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.	0
Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders' own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times.	0
He voted against the Brady Bill five times.	0
He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole.	1
"He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, ""was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. """	0
He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks.	0
He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives.	0
Let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country.	0
That's 33,000 people a year.	0
One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered.	0
Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation.	1
There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.	0
All right, Governor O'Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns.	0
This conversation might be worrying many of them.	0
"They may be hearing, ""you want to take my guns."	0
What would you say to them?	0
This is what I would say Lester, look see, I've listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them.	0
They've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.	0
I'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation.	0
This is very personal to me being from Baltimore.	0
I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns' Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet.	0
And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital.	0
He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.	0
And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him.	0
I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital.	0
In his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.	0
So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together.	0
We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation.	0
It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what?	0
We did not interrupt a single person's hunting season.	0
I've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer.	0
And, so...	0
[ applause ]	0
...we're able to actually do these things.	0
Alright, Governor, thank you.	0
Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year.	0
Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings.	0
We won't forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.	0
We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap.	0
Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?	0
Well, sadly it's reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers.	0
Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	0
And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.	0
One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison.	0
That's the statistic.	0
I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...	0
[ applause ]	0
...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.	0
So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.	0
You time is up.	0
Senator Sanders, my next question is...	0
...Well, I — look...	0
...	0
It's actually — actually my next question is to you...	0
... Let me respond to what the secretary said.	0
We have a criminal justice system which is broken.	0
Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China?	0
Disproportionately African American, and Latino.	0
Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed?	0
Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO's of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders...	0
... We need to take a very hard look at our...	0
Senator.	0
Senator Sanders...	0
... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .	0
... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you.	0
He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision.	0
In fact, our polling shows she's beating you more than two to one among minority voters.	0
How can you be the nominee if you don't have that support?	0
Well, let me talk about polling.	0
[ laughter ]	0
As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me.	0
We were all of three percentage points.	0
Guess what?	0
In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close.	0
Maybe we're ahead New Hampshire.	0
[ cheering ]	0
In terms of polling, guess what?	0
We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton.	0
In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.	0
To answer your question.	0
When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice — just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community.	0
We have the momentum, we're on a path to a victory.	0
[ applause and cheering ]	0
Lester, I	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Governor, I'm going to come to you in a second.	0
"Google searches for the words, ""Black Lives Matter"" surpassed, ""civil rights movement""."	0
"And, here in South Carolina, ""black lives matter"" was the number one trending political issue. Governor O'Malley, you've campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore."	0
Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.	0
And right from the start of your campaign, you've been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest.	0
What responsibility do you bear?	0
Yes, let's talk about this.	0
When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well.	0
It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.	0
And that's why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter.	0
And we did a number of things.	0
We weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.	0
But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations.	0
The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board.	0
And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I've put forward.	0
We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives.	0
We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force.	0
I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.	0
I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.	0
I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...	0
[ applause ]	0
All right.	0
Let's talk...	0
... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.	0
Let's talk more about policing and the criminal justice system.	0
Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we're going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos.	0
Let's watch.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
Hey, I'm Franchesca Ramsey.	0
I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.	0
For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren't indicted.	0
How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?	0
[ end video clip ]	0
Senator Sanders.	0
I apologize for not hearing all of that question.	0
Would you like me to read it back to you?	0
Yes.	0
"Prosecutors — ""I believe there's a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities."	0
Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.	0
"How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?"""	0
Absolutely.	0
This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved.	0
Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general's investigation.	0
[ applause ]	0
Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.	0
If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.	0
[ applause ]	0
And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don't look like occupying armies.	0
We've got to move toward community policing.	0
And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, this question is for you.	0
Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike.	0
It has become a major issue in this race.	0
In a lot of places where you've been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed.	0
So what would you do?	0
Well, Lester, you're right.	0
Everywhere I go to campaign, I'm meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned.	0
And I've met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.	0
So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.	0
The policing needs to change.	0
Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan.	0
They should be able to administer it.	0
So should firefighters and others.	0
We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue.	0
And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.	0
And that's time.	0
So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...	0
Senator...	0
... a growing epidemic.	0
Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?	0
Sure.	0
I agree...	0
[ applause ]	0
I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.	0
And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment.	0
People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...	0
That's...	0
... healthcare with mental health...	0
... time.	0
... a part of that.	0
We're going to get into all that coming up.	0
Lester, just ten seconds.	0
But we're going to take a break and we need to take a break...	0
Just 10 seconds.	0
All of the things...	0
... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to Charleston.	0
Let's turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement — that would be health care.	0
Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.	0
Let's turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.	0
Thank you, Lester.	0
"Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls ""Medicare for all."""	0
Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.	0
Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?	0
Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care.	0
I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the '90s, and I didn't quit until we got the children's health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.	0
And I certainly respect Senator Sanders' intentions, but when you're talking about health care, the details really matter.	0
And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people's health care?	0
He didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either.	0
And tonight, he's come out with a new health care plan.	0
And again, we need to get into the details.	0
But here's what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.	0
We finally have a path to universal health care.	0
We have accomplished so much already.	0
I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don't to want see us start over again with a contentious debate.	0
I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.	0
[ applause ]	0
OK.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Secretary — Secretary Clinton didn't answer your question.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Because what her campaign was saying — Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children's health insurance program.	0
That is nonsense.	0
What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right.	0
Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in?	0
They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.	0
I'm on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act.	0
I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation.	0
I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance.	0
We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.	0
And here's the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country.	0
My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.	0
That's the vision we need to take.	0
[ applause ]	0
But — Senator Sanders, if I can...	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, I have to say I'm not sure whether we're talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we're talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress.	0
But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act.	0
That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.	0
[ applause ]	0
And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance.	0
We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.	0
[ applause ]	0
We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men.	0
And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent's policy.	0
But — what if we have...	0
Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.	0
It is — it is absolutely inaccurate.	0
I have to talk about something that's actually working in our state.	0
Governor — Governor Sanders...	0
No one is tearing this up, we're going to go forward.	0
But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.	0
Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people?	0
Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians.	0
The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.	0
We're not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act.	0
I helped write it.	0
But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for-all system.	0
Andrea — Andrea — Andrea.	0
[	0
crosstalk ]	0
[ applause ]	0
Instead of — Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.	0
In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system.	0
With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.	0
And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital.	0
How well they keep their patients.	0
That's the future.	0
We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
And that's exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act — what Governor O'Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.	0
But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back.	0
The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...	0
Yeah.	0
... you've talked about Medicare for all...	0
Yes.	0
.. and tonight you've released a very detailed plan, just two...	0
Not all that detailed.	0
... well, two hours before the debate, you did.	0
Well.	0
But let me ask you about Vermont.	0
Because in Vermont — you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of — of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...	0
Well, that's — you might want to ask...	0
... and by some estimates, it would double the budget.	0
If you couldn't sell it in Vermont, Senator...	0
Andrea, let me just say this.	0
... how can you sell it to the country?	0
Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it.	0
I'm not the governor.	0
I'm the senator from the state of Vermont.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But second of all — second of all...	0
[ applause ]	0
... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you've raised — the good questions you've raised.	0
You know what it all comes down to?	0
Do you know why we can't do what every other country — major country on Earth is doing?	0
It's because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.	0
What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward — it's Medicare for all — it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry.	0
That's what this debate should be about.	0
[ applause ]	0
Well, as someone who — as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...	0
[ applause ]	0
...many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it's important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.	0
I know how much money influences the political decision-making.	0
That's why I'm for huge campaign finance reform.	0
However, we started a system that had private health insurance.	0
And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option.	0
In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn't get the votes for that.	0
So, what I'm saying is really simple.	0
This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades.	0
We have the Affordable Care Act.	0
Let's make it work.	0
Let's take the models that states are doing.	0
We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years.	1
Now we've got to get individual costs down.	1
That's what I'm planning to do.	0
And that's time.	0
We're gonna take a turn now.	0
Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together.	0
If President Obama couldn't do it, how will you?	0
Great question.	0
Well, I think it's an important point the president made in his State of the Union.	0
And here's what I would say.	0
I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.	0
That's what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children's Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.	0
What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.	0
And it's what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States.	0
So I know it's hard, but I also know you've got to work at it every single day.	0
I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress.	0
And I know that they work at it every single day.	0
Because maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows.	0
If you're successful there, maybe you can build even more.	0
That's what I would do.	0
That's time.	0
Senator Sanders, response.	0
[ applause ]	0
A couple of years ago, when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner, I worked with folks like John McCain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran's health care legislation in modern history.	0
But let me rephrase your question because I think, in all do respect, you're expression.	0
In all do respect, you're missing the main point.	0
And the main point in the Congress, it's not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.	0
That's a mythology from the media.	0
The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.	0
[ applause ]	0
The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour.	0
The American people want it.	0
Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it.	0
The pay equity for women, the American people want it.	0
Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes.	0
The American people want it.	0
That's time.	0
But let me continue with the...	0
The point is, we have to make Congress respond to the needs of the people, not big money.	0
Senator Sanders, let me continue, you call yourself a Democratic socialist...	0
I do.	0
"And throughout your career in politics, you've been critical of the Democratic party, you've been saying in a book you wrote, quote, ""There wasn't a hell of a big difference between the the two major parties."""	0
How would you will a general election...	0
Did I say that?	0
How will you win a general election labeling yourself a democratic socialist?	0
Because of what I believe in what I was just saying.	0
The Democratic party needs major reform.	0
To those of you in South Carolina, you know what, in Mississippi, we need a 50-state strategy so that people in South Carolina and Mississippi can get the resources that they need.	0
Instead of being dependent on super PACs, what we need is to be dependent on small, individual campaign contributors.	0
We need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low-income people.	0
Not wealthy campaign contributors.	0
Yes, but senator, you can...	0
We need to expand what the input into the Democratic party.	0
I am very proud that in this campaign, we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people, from working people.	0
We have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point.	0
[ applause ]	0
Yes, but senator you never came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.	0
In fact, neither of you came to campaign for Vincent Sheheen when he was running for governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
We can talk all we want about wanting to build a stronger Democratic party, but Lester, the question you answered, it's no laughing matter.	0
The most recurring question I get when I stand on the chair all across Iowa and talk with my neighbors is, how are you going to heal the divisions and the wounds in our country?	0
This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.	0
All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that's what we need now in a new leader.	0
We cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies or the war is all about being against millionaires or billionaires, or it's all against American Muslims, all against immigrants.	0
Look, as Frederick Douglas said, we are one, our cause is one, and we must help each other if we are going to succeed.	0
And that is right.	0
And I respectfully disagree.	0
Secretary Clinton, our next question is for you.	0
Here's another quantitative problem.	0
And I respectfully disagree with my friend over here.	0
And that is, you are right.	0
All of us have denounced Trump's attempts to divide this country: the anti-Latino rhetoric, the racist rhetoric, he anti-Muslim rhetoric.	0
But where I disagree with you, Governor O'Malley, is I do believe we have to deal with the fundamental issues of a handful of billionaires...	0
I agree with that.	0
... who control economic and political life of this country.	0
I agree.	0
Nothing real will get happened.	0
Unless we have a political revolution.	0
Where millions of people finally stand up.	0
And we're going to get into that coming up.	0
But Secretary Clinton, here's a question from YouTube.	0
It's from a young video blogger who has over 5 million subscribers.	0
He has a question about the importance of younger voters.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
Hi, I'm Connor Franta, I'm 23 and my audience is around the same age.	0
Getting my generation to vote should be a priority for any presidential candidate.	0
Now I know Senator Sanders is pretty popular among my peers, but what I want to know is, how are all of you planning on engaging us further in this election?	0
[ end video clip ]	0
Secretary Clinton.	0
Well thanks for the question and congratulations on five million viewers on YouTube, that's quite an accomplishment.	0
Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.	0
I've laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing.	0
So making community college free, making it possible to attend a public college or university with debt free tuition, looking for ways to protect our rights especially from the concerted Republican assault; on voting rights, on women's rights, on gay rights, on civil rights, on workers rights.	0
And I know how much young people value their independence, their autonomy, and their rights.	0
So I think this is an election where we have to pull young people and older people together to have a strategy about how we're going to encourage even more American's to vote because it absolutely clear to me...	0
That's time...	0
That turning over our White House to the Republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people.	0
A quick follow up — a thirty second follow up.	0
Why is Senator Sanders beating you to 2 to 1 among younger votes?	0
Look, I have the greatest respect for Senator Sanders and for his supports and I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to reach as many people of all ages about what I will do, what the experience and the ideas that I have that I will bring to the White House and I hope to have their support when I'm the Democratic nominee.	0
We're going to take...	0
Is that your strategy...	0
We're going to take a break.	0
When we come back; big banks, big business and big differences among the three candidates on the American Economy.	0
We'll be right back.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back from Charleston.	0
Let's turn now to the economy.	0
Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street.	0
One says it's OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do.	0
My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.	0
What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?	0
Well, the first difference is I don't take money from big banks.	0
I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.	0
What I would do...	0
[ applause ]	0
What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.	0
You've got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you've got to break up these huge financial institutions.	0
They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy.	0
If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful.	0
Break them up.	0
I believe that's what the American people to want see.	0
That's my view.	0
Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.	0
Well, there's no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail.	0
We agree on that.	0
But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don't just affect me, I can take that, but he's criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession.	0
Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing.	0
He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama.	0
Now, I personally believe that President Obama's work to push through the Dodd-Frank...	0
[ laughter ]	0
The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we've had since the 1930s.	0
So I'm going to defend Dodd-Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.	0
[ applause ]	0
OK. First of all...	0
Senator Sanders, your response.	0
Set the record right.	0
In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected.	0
He and I are friends.	0
We've worked together on many issues.	0
We have some differences of opinion.	0
But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals?	0
So it's easy to say, well, I'm going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street.	0
I am very proud, I do not have a super PAC.	0
I do not want Wall Street's money.	0
I'll rely on the middle class and working families...	0
That's time.	0
Governor O'Malley...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... campaign contributions.	0
I have a question for you...	0
[ applause ]	0
You know, I think since — since Senator Standers followed up on this...	0
Thirty-second response.	0
Your profusion of comments about your feelings towards President Obama are a little strange given what you said about him in 2011.	0
But look, I have a plan that most commentators have said is tougher, more effective, and more comprehensive.	0
That's not true.	0
It builds on the Dodd-Frank — yes, it is.	0
It builds on the Dodd-Frank, regulatory scheme...	0
It's just not true.	0
... but it goes much further, because...	0
Oh, come on.	0
... both the governor and the senator have focused only on the big banks.	0
Lehman Brothers, AIG, the shadow banking sector were as big a problem in what caused the Great Recession, I go after them.	0
And I can tell you that the hedge fund billionaires who are running ads against me right now, and Karl Rove, who started running an ad against me right now, funded by money from the financial services sector, sure thing, I'm the one they don't want to be up against.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor O'Malley.	0
Yes, thank you.	0
Yes, Lester, what Secretary Clinton just said is actually not true.	0
What — I have put forward a plan that would actually put cops back on the beat of Wall Street.	0
I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.	0
Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he's just going to keep robbing banks again.	0
The same thing is true with people in suits.	0
Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there's no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true.	0
I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.	0
In prior debates I've heard you even bring up — I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.	0
In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it.	0
The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.	0
And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that's on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street.	0
And we're just as vulnerable today.	0
Secretary Clinton, 30-second response.	0
[ applause ]	0
Yes, well, first of all — first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan.	0
Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank.	0
It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...	0
And we have never used it.	0
That pose a risk to the financial sector.	0
I want to go further and add to that.	0
And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street.	0
You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor's Association...	0
Yes, but I haven't gotten a penny this year...	0
And you were...	0
... so somebody please, go on to martinomalley.com...	0
[ laughter ]	0
.	0
Go on to martinomalley.com, send me your checks.	0
They're not giving me — zero.	0
Yes, well, the point is that if we're going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what's in Dodd-Frank, and what's in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...with his regulators to make those decisions.	0
Let me give you an example of how corrupt — how corrupt this system is.	0
Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion.	0
Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.	0
Say it.	0
The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.	0
Secretary Clinton — and you're not the only one, so I don't mean to just point the finger at you, you've received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.	0
I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.	0
[ applause ]	0
That's time.	0
Andrea.	0
Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O'Malley's phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08.	0
So there's plenty...	0
If you want to...	0
There's plenty of problems that we all have to face together.	0
And the final thing I would say, we're at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...	0
...	0
Senator...	0
...	0
The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank.	0
That's what we need to stop...	0
[ applause ]	0
Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs.	0
They got the government off their backs.	0
Turns out that they were crooks, and they destroyed our economy.	0
I think it's time to put the government back on their backs.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders — Senator Sanders, you've talked a lot about things you want to do.	0
You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour.	0
You want to expand Social Security...	0
... Yeah...	0
... benefits.	0
You've been specific about what you want, but let's talk about how to pay for all this.	0
You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan.	0
You haven't been specific about how to pay for the other things...	0
... That's true.	0
... Will you tell us tonight?	0
Good.	0
You're right.	0
I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs.	0
We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes.	0
Yes, I do.	0
I plead guilty.	0
I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free.	0
And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.	0
How do I pay for it?	0
[ applause ]	0
I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation.	0
This country, and the middle class, bailed out Wall Street.	0
Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class.	0
In fact...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
... we have documented, unlike Secretary Clinton, I have documented exactly how I would pay for our ambitious agenda.	0
Andrea...	0
... OK...	0
...	0
The only person on this stage who has...	0
... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier — Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?	0
Well, I have actually documented every way that I'm going to pay for what I'm doing because I think the American public deserves to know.	0
And, you can go to my website and actually see that.	0
But, there are serious questions about how we're going to pay for what we want to see our country do.	0
And, I'm the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class.	0
I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave.	0
To help us bring down student debt we're going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.	0
Yeah, and that will also come out of the — some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...	0
OK, we're out of time.	0
Senator Sanders,	0
But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I've proposed...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Sanders...	0
...	0
Here is the main two points...	0
...	0
Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes.	0
Yeah.	0
The most googled political issue...	0
...	0
I got it.	0
In the last month was taxes.	0
Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also.	0
Is that correct?	0
What is correct, and I'm disappointed that Secretary Clinton's campaign has made this criticism.	0
It's a Republican criticism.	0
Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families.	0
So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.	0
So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs.	0
A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums.	0
It's a pretty good deal.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator — Senator, let me just follow up on that.	0
Yeah.	0
On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave.	0
And, having said that, now you say you're going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well.	0
Is that breaking your word?	0
No, it is not breaking my word.	0
When you are — it's one thing to say I'm raising taxes, it's another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.	0
So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.	0
Senator, I'm the only person on this stage that's actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.	0
I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.	0
[ laughter ]	0
OK.	0
So, that was eight years.	0
Yes.	0
And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time — I mean, during a recession.	0
And Andrea, the — I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation.	0
We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.	0
The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal — like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.	0
And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.	0
And if we tax earnings from investments on money — namely capital gains — at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.	0
We have got a lot to ground to cover here.	0
Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtube's MinuteEarth channel.	0
Here's their take.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
Hello from MinuteEarth.	0
Fossil fuels have long kept our cars moving and our light bulbs lit.	0
But we know that burning these fuels releases heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet, causing seas to rise and contributing to extreme weather events, like South Carolina's devastating flooding last year.	0
Fighting human-caused climate change means giving up our global addiction to fossil fuels and shifting the bulk of the world's energy supply to alternative sources.	0
Some countries have acted decisively to make this transition.	0
But here at home, we still get a whooping 82 percent of our energy from coal, oil, and natural gas.	0
In the U.S., political gridlock, pressure from industry lobbyists and insufficient R&D have made an already tough battle against climate change even tougher.	0
[ end video clip ]	0
Senator Sanders, Americans love their SUVs, which spiked in sales last year as gas prices plummeted.	0
How do you convince Americans that the problem of climate change is so urgent that they need to change their behavior?	0
I think we already are.	0
Younger generation understands it instinctively.	0
I was home in Burlington, Vermont, on Christmas Eve, the temperature was 65 degrees.	0
People in Vermont know what's going on.	0
People who did ice fishing, where their ice is no longer there on the lake understand what's going on.	0
I'm on both the Environmental and Energy Committees.	0
The debate is over.	0
Climate change is real.	0
It is already causing major problems.	0
And if we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.	0
It is amazing to me, and I think we'll have agreement on this up here, that we have a major party, called the Republican Party that is so owned by the fossil fuel industry and their campaign contributions that they don't even have the courage, the decency to listen to the scientists.	0
[ applause ]	0
It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Bottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs.	0
We must, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.	0
I've got the most comprehensive legislation in the Senate to do that.	0
And as president, I will fight to make that happen.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor O'Malley, 30 seconds.	0
Thank you.	0
Lester, on this stage tonight, this Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I would like to challenge and invite my colleagues here on this stage to join me in putting forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean, electric energy grid by 2050.	0
It can be done.	0
[ applause ]	0
With solar, with wind, with new technologies, with green buildings, this can happen, but in all — President Obama made us more energy independent, but in all of the above strategy didn't land us on the moon, we need American ingenuity and we need to reach by 2050 for the sake of our kids.	0
That's time.	0
We're going to take a break.	0
And let me...	0
When we return, the late-breaking developments regarding Iran.	0
The threat of ISIS now more real than ever on U.S. soil.	0
Americans in fear and hearing few good answers.	0
We'll be right back.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.	0
Thank you Lester.	0
Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced.	0
Iran is getting it's billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home.	0
"The president said today, ""it's a good day."	0
It's a good day for diplomacy.	0
"It's a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran."""	0
I think what we've got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran.	0
Understanding that Iran's behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we're hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.	0
On the other hand, the fact that we've managed to reach an agreement, something that I've very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war.	0
And that I believe we're seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step.	0
So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future?	0
Yes.	0
Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow?	0
No, I don't think we should.	0
But I think the goal has go to be as we've done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.	0
Your response Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement.	0
I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office.	0
I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran.	0
It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.	0
And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement.	0
But I think we still have to carefully watch them.	0
We've had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization.	0
And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement.	0
And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.	0
You mentioned Syria.	0
Let me ask you about Syria, all of you.	0
Let's turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there.	0
Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?	0
Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.	0
Absolutely not.	0
I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces.	0
It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we're doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.	0
I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space.	0
So I'm very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.	0
Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no?	0
As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud.	0
I know President Obama's been getting a lot of criticism on this.	0
I think he is doing the right thing.	0
What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq.	0
To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.	0
Andrea...	0
Governor O'Malley?	0
We should — we should learn — we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place.	0
And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries.	0
That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.	0
Governor O'Malley.	0
Thank you.	0
[ applause ]	0
Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition.	0
And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.	0
We need to learn the lessons from the past.	0
We do need to provide the special — special ops advisers, we need — do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances.	0
We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.	0
And I also want to add one other thing here.	0
I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don't use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato and macho sending other kids — kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground.	0
"A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, ""Governor, when you're with your colleagues, please don't refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground."""	0
Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.	0
[ applause ]	0
I have a question.	0
I have a question for Senator Sanders.	0
Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?	0
No.	0
I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.	0
Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition.	0
And what happened there is yes, it's easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn't the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs.	0
And who rises up?	0
Groups like ISIS.	0
So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I'm going to do my best to bring American troops home.	0
And I supported what he did.	0
Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.	0
And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar.	0
Qatar happens to be the largest — wealthiest country per capita in the world.	0
They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.	0
[ applause ]	0
Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama's decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president's credibility.	0
Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?	0
Look, I think that the president's decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome.	0
We were able to get the chemical weapons out.	0
I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad's forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey.	0
So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...	0
But should he — should he have stuck to his...	0
Well — but — but...	0
... line?	0
Did it hurt U.S. credibility?	0
I think, as commander in chief, you've got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make.	0
I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.	0
And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region.	0
If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.	0
It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing.	0
Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.	0
So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region.	0
We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran.	0
You know, one of the criticisms I've had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...	0
Your time is up.	0
... and go after ISIS, which I don't think would be a good idea.	0
Let me just...	0
Senator....	0
But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...	0
You're out of time.	0
OK. Let me suggest...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Sanders.	0
Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said.	0
But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it's hard to know who's fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS' hand the next day.	0
We all know that.	0
And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people.	0
This is beyond disgusting.	0
But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS.	0
Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.	0
But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.	0
But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we're leaving out something very important here.	0
And that is that we still don't have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.	0
We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need.	0
And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.	0
So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.	0
Your time is us.	0
Lester.	0
Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago.	0
Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009.	0
Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria.	0
As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?	0
Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia.	0
We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.	0
We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments.	0
So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn't some way you can advance your security and your values.	0
When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission.	0
And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down.	0
And in fact, accused me of fomenting it.	0
So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.	0
What's your relationship with him?	0
Well, my relationship with him, it's — it's interesting.	0
[ laughter ]	0
It's one, I think, of respect.	0
We've had some very tough dealings with one another.	0
And I know that he's someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.	0
And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we've got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.	0
[ applause ]	0
We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans.	0
That brings us to YouTube and this question.	0
[ begin video clip ]	0
Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I've been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.	0
I think America's future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right.	0
Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.	0
So do you think it's possible to find common ground?	0
And where do you stand on privacy versus security?	0
[ end video clip ]	0
So, Governor O'Malley.	0
Thank you.	0
I believe whether it's a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.	0
So we're a collaborative people.	0
We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.	0
But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms.	0
And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.	0
I also want to the say that while we've made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there.	0
We need a public advocate.	0
We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.	0
That's time.	0
You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we've been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia.	0
How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?	0
Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...	0
That's a question to Senator Sanders.	0
I wasn't clear, I apologize.	0
OK.	0
I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O'Malley mentioned.	0
But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.	0
You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.	0
And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology.	0
So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...	0
But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?	0
Right.	0
What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.	0
But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
We have to go to a — we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we're going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.	0
Oh, we're breaking?	0
OK.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
And welcome back to Charleston.	0
As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off.	0
I'll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.	0
Can I get 30 seconds, too?	0
[ laughter ]	0
Can I get 50 seconds?	0
Secretary Clinton.	0
Well, I wanted to say, and I'll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama's administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.	0
We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world.	0
And then, we've got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.	0
And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you're hearing from the Republican side.	0
We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.	0
[ applause ]	0
And Andrea has a follow-up.	0
And Andrea — Andrea — Andrea...	0
Just a — just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton.	0
Just a moment, Governor.	0
Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?	0
But — but — Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down.	0
They got nowhere.	0
That is not what I've heard.	0
Let me leave it at that.	0
Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.	0
Ever since the attacks of September 11th — 30 seconds.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.	0
Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we're almost like it's — your body's immune system.	0
It's able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it's better connected — the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.	0
But there's another front in this battle, and it is this.	0
That's the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims.	0
That can do more damage to our democracy than any...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
All right, that's time, and — and we do...	0
[ applause ]	0
...we do have to move on.	0
Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...	0
Can I get a — can I just get a very brief response?	0
Very brief.	0
Thirty — 30 — 30 seconds, Senator.	0
OK. One — and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O'Malley said.	0
But here's an issue that we also should talk about.	0
We have a $600 billion military budget.	0
It is a budget larger than the next eight countries'.	0
Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.	1
Very little of that budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.	1
We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.	0
All right.	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
[ applause ]	0
...this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president.	0
You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can.	0
Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?	0
Well, it'll start at the kitchen table, we'll see how it goes from there.	0
And I...	0
[ applause ]	0
...I'm going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband's leadership and the '90s — especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history — you bet.	0
I'm going to ask for his ideas, I'm going ask for his advice, and I'm going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we've got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that's wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.	0
We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.	0
Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.	0
[ applause ]	0
Great ideas, Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here's the truth.	0
If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain't going to accomplish very much.	0
So here's a promise that I make — and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is — Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.	0
Here's a promise.	0
If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have — bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question.	0
"You called Bill Clinton's past transgressions, quote, ""totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable."""	0
Senator, do you regret saying that?	0
I was asked a question.	0
You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I — that question annoys me.	0
I cannot walk down the street — Secretary Clinton knows this — without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I'd make some vicious attack.	0
I have avoided doing that.	0
Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.	0
[ applause ]	0
I was asked a question.	0
You didn't have to answer it that way, though.	0
Why did you?	0
Well — then if I don't answer it, then there's another front page, so it's yes.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And I mean this seriously.	0
You know that.	0
We've been through this.	0
Yes, his behavior was deplorable.	0
Have I ever once said a word about that issue?	0
No, I have not.	0
I'm going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton's personal behavior.	0
[ applause ]	0
We will take a break.	0
We'll continue from Charleston right after this.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back everybody.	0
Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you.	0
We believe we've learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven't gotten a chance to say.	0
And, we'll start with Governor O'Malley.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Didn't see that coming, did you?	0
Yes, but we're going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.	0
[ laughter ]	0
...too long.	0
I believe there are many issues.	0
I have 60 seconds for this?	0
Sixty seconds, we'd appreciate it.	0
There are so many issues that we haven't been able to discuss here.	0
We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation's now maintaining.	0
We haven't discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.	0
[ applause ]	0
We haven't discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.	0
I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us.	0
Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good.	0
There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.	0
We're on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.	0
And that's time.	0
Thanks a lot.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what's happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged.	0
We've had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water.	0
And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care.	0
He had request for help and he had basically stone walled.	0
I'll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would've been action.	0
So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help.	0
I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V.	0
"show and I said, ""it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had."""	0
And that's time.	0
I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Sanders?	0
Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor.	0
A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.	0
Now, we are a great nation — and we've heard a lot of great ideas here tonight.	0
Let's be honest and let's be truthful.	0
Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.	0
We've got to get rid of Super PACs, we've got to get rid of Citizens' United and what we've got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process.	0
"To say loudly and clearly,"" that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors."""	0
All right.	0
Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.	0
I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell.	0
This has been great.	0
It's been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.	0
Of course, a great education isn't all we need in this new economy.	0
We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.	0
After all, it's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber.	0
For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.	0
Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain.	0
But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build.	0
That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them.	0
And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.	0
That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about.	0
It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage.	0
Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far.	0
Health care inflation has slowed.	0
And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.	1
Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon.	0
But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security.	0
Say a hardworking American loses his job – we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him.	0
If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.	0
And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.	0
That's the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.	0
I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty.	0
America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.	0
But there are other areas where it's been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years – namely what role the government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.	0
And here, the American people have a choice to make.	0
I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy.	0
I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there's red tape that needs to be cut.	0
But after years of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.	0
Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.	0
Immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.	0
It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.	0
In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.	0
The rules should work for them.	0
And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.	0
In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.	0
This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?	0
Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there.	0
We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget.	0
We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.	0
That spirit of discovery is in our DNA.	0
We're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.	0
We're Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.	0
We're every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world.	0
And over the past seven years, we've nurtured that spirit.	0
We've protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.	0
We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.	0
But we can do so much more.	0
Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.	0
Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade.	0
Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done.	0
And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.	0
For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.	0
Medical research is critical.	0
We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.	0
Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.	0
You'll be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it.	0
But even if the planet wasn't at stake; even if 2014 wasn't the warmest year on record – until 2015 turned out even hotter – why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?	0
Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.	0
Here are the results.	0
In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.	0
On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal – in jobs that pay better than average.	0
We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy – something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.	0
Meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.	0
Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.	0
Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy.	0
Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future – especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.	0
That's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.	0
That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21 st century transportation system.	0
None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.	0
But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, and the planet we'll preserve – that's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.	0
Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world.	0
And that's why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a problem.	0
I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air.	1
Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.	1
The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.	1
Period.	0
It's not even close.	0
We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.	1
Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.	0
No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin.	0
Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead – they call us.	0
As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time.	0
But that's not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower.	0
In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.	0
The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia.	0
Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition.	0
Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria – states they see slipping away from their orbit.	0
And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.	0
It's up to us to help remake that system.	0
And that means we have to set priorities.	0
Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.	0
Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage.	0
They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies.	0
But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.	0
Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped.	0
But they do not threaten our national existence.	0
That's the story ISIL wants to tell; that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.	0
We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world's largest religions.	0
We just need to call them what they are – killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.	0
That's exactly what we are doing.	0
For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology.	0
With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons.	0
We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.	0
If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL.	0
Take a vote.	0
But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.	0
If you doubt America's commitment – or mine – to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden.	0
Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.	0
When you come after Americans, we go after you.	0
It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.	0
Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can't stop there.	0
For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world – in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia.	0
Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.	0
The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.	0
That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.	0
We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis.	0
That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us.	0
It's the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq – and we should have learned it by now.	0
Fortunately, there's a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power.	0
It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.	0
That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.	0
That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.	0
As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.	0
That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.	0
Our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.	0
That's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.	0
It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs.	0
With TPP, China doesn't set the rules in that region, we do.	0
You want to show our strength in this century?	0
Approve this agreement.	0
Give us the tools to enforce it.	0
Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America.	0
That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.	0
You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere?	0
Recognize that the Cold War is over.	0
Lift the embargo.	0
American leadership in the 21 st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world – except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.	0
Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right.	0
It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity.	0
When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change – that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children.	0
When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon.	0
When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores.	0
Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria – something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.	0
That's strength.	0
That's leadership.	0
And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.	0
That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo: it's expensive, it's unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.	1
That's why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion.	0
This isn't a matter of political correctness.	0
It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong.	0
The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.	0
"His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that ""to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place."""	0
When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer.	0
That's not telling it like it is.	0
It's just wrong.	0
It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.	0
It makes it harder to achieve our goals.	0
And it betrays who we are as a country.	0
We the People.	0
Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together.	0
That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.	0
The future we want – opportunity and security for our families; a rising standard of living and a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids – all that is within our reach.	0
But it will only happen if we work together.	0
It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates.	0
It will only happen if we fix our politics.	0
A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.	0
This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests.	0
That's one of our strengths, too.	0
Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.	0
But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.	0
It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic.	0
Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us.	0
Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention.	0
Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.	0
Too many Americans feel that way right now.	0
It's one of the few regrets of my presidency – that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.	0
There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.	0
But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task – or any President's – alone.	0
There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected.	0
I know; you've told me.	0
And if we want a better politics, it's not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.	0
We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around.	0
We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can't bankroll our elections – and if our existing approach to campaign finance can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution.	0
We've got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now.	0
And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.	0
But I can't do these things on my own.	0
Changes in our political process – in not just who gets elected but how they get elected – that will only happen when the American people demand it.	0
It will depend on you.	0
That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.	0
What I'm asking for is hard.	0
It's easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don't matter.	0
But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future.	0
Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure.	0
As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.	0
We can't afford to go down that path.	0
It won't deliver the economy we want, or the security we want, but most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.	0
So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen.	0
To vote.	0
To speak out.	0
To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us.	0
To stay active in our public life so it reflects the goodness and decency and optimism that I see in the American people every single day.	0
It won't be easy.	0
Our brand of democracy is hard.	0
But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I'll be right there with you as a citizen – inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far.	0
Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed.	0
Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word – voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.	0
They're out there, those voices.	0
They don't get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.	0
I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours.	0
I see you.	0
I know you're there.	0
You're the reason why I have such incredible confidence in our future.	0
Because I see your quiet, sturdy citizenship all the time.	0
I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages to keep him on board.	0
I see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.	0
I see it in the American who served his time, and dreams of starting over – and the business owner who gives him that second chance.	0
The protester determined to prove that justice matters, and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe.	0
I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him 'til he can run a marathon, and the community that lines up to cheer him on.	0
It's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he's been taught.	0
I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.	0
That's the America I know.	0
That's the country we love.	0
Clear-eyed.	0
Big-hearted.	0
Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.	0
That's what makes me so hopeful about our future.	0
Because of you.	0
I believe in you.	0
That's why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong.	0
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.	0
Thank you, Phoenix.	0
I am so glad to be back in Arizona, a state that has a very special place in my heart.	0
I love the people of Arizona and, together, we are going to win the White House in November.	0
Tonight is not going to be a normal rally speech.	0
Instead, I am going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today: immigration.	0
I have just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico -- a man I like and respect very much, and a man who truly loves his country.	0
Just like I am a man who loves the United States.	0
We agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.	0
We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the close friendship between our two nations.	0
It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation.	0
This is the first of what I expect will be many conversations in a Trump Administration about creating a new relationship between our two countries.	0
But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington.	0
There is no other way.	0
The truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes.	0
But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up.	0
Today you will get the truth.	0
The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians.	0
Let me tell you who it doesn't serve: it doesn't serve you, the American people.	0
When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages.	0
Immigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.	0
But if we are going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and sensitive issues.	0
For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills, and living conditions.	0
These are valid concerns, expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.	0
We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate.	0
It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish here.	0
Then there is the issue of security.	0
Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws.	0
I have met with many of the parents who lost their children to Sanctuary Cities and open borders.	0
They will be joining me on the stage later today.	0
Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration.	0
This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root.	0
The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House.	0
He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.	0
Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.	0
Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona.	0
He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.	0
Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.	0
Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home.	0
The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.	0
In California, a 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer.	0
Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.	0
A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.	0
On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.	1
For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.	0
While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in.	0
But these facts are never reported.	0
Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing, and only this one thing: the needs of people living here illegally.	0
The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants -- or however many there may be.	1
That has never been the central issue.	0
It will never be the central issue.	0
Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.	0
Only out of touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status.	1
To all the politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me today: there is only one core issue in the immigration debate and it is this: the well-being of the American people.	0
Nothing even comes a close second.	0
Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated.	0
But she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable death.	0
No, she's only talking about families who came here in violation of the law.	0
We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with dignity.	0
We will be fair, just and compassionate to all.	0
But our greatest compassion must be for American citizens.	0
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders.	1
President Obama and Hillary Clinton support Sanctuary Cities, they support catch-and-release on the border, they support visa overstays, they support the release of dangerous criminals from detention -- and they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.	0
Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants -- breaking the federal budget.	1
On top of that, she promises uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, especially African-American and Hispanic workers.	0
This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees in a four-year term.	0
Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan -- about which she has not answered a single substantive question -- let me tell you about my plan.	0
While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, along with top immigration experts who represent workers, not corporations.	0
I also worked with lawmakers who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years, and most importantly, I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies.	0
Number One: We will build a wall along the Southern Border.	0
On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border.	0
We will use the best technology, including above-and below-ground sensors, towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out the criminal cartels, and Mexico will pay for the wall.	0
Number Two: End Catch-And-Release	0
Under my Administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.	0
Number Three: Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.	0
According to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country.	0
We will begin moving them out day one, in joint operations with local, state and federal law enforcement.	0
Beyond the 2 million, there are a vast number of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled or evaded justice.	0
But their days on the run will soon be over.	0
They go out, and they go out fast.	0
Moving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings.	0
We will terminate the Obama Administration's deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets.	0
Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities -- these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.	1
My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens.	0
We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program.	0
We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails.	0
Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this Administration.	0
This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.	0
On my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass 'Kate's Law' -- named for Kate Steinle -- to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences.	0
Another reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously-deported illegal immigrant.	0
The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly identified and removed.	0
We are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.	0
Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and removing quickly the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice.	0
The local police know who every one of these criminals are.	0
There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years.	0
And now, finally, we will turn the tables and law enforcement will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.	0
We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks.	0
We will expand the number of Border Patrol Stations.	0
I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them.	0
The endorsement I've received from the Border Patrol officers means more to me than I can say.	0
Number Four: Block Funding For Sanctuary Cities	0
We will end the Sanctuary Cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths.	0
Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.	0
Number Five: Cancel Unconstitutional Executive Orders & Enforce All Immigration Laws	0
We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants.	0
Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs -- including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the Supreme Court.	0
Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty.	0
Clinton's plan would trigger a Constitutional Crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before.	0
In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office.	0
In a Trump Administration, all immigration laws will be enforced.	0
As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities.	0
But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement -- and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs.	0
Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation -- that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.	0
Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges -- that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under the current Administration.	0
Number Six: We Are Going To Suspend The Issuance Of Visas To Any Place Where Adequate Screening Cannot Occur	0
According to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States.	0
The number is likely higher, but the Administration refuses to provide this information to Congress.	0
As soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.	0
Countries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya.	0
For the price of resettling 1 refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region.	0
Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.	0
For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan -- in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.	0
Applicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on Radical Islam, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure.	0
Number Seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported	0
There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals.	1
Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into U.S. communities.	0
There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year.	0
Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance.	0
The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home.	0
According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back.	0
Many of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch -- she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.	0
Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable, who went on to reoffend at a very high rate.	0
Number Eight: We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system.	0
For years, Congress has required a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, but it has never been completed.	0
In my Administration, we will ensure that this system is in place at all land, air, and sea ports.	0
Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never left.	1
Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose a substantial threat to national security.	0
The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and 'would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas.'	0
Last year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas.	0
Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my Administration.	0
If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never leave -- the Obama-Clinton policy -- then we have a completely open border.	0
We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.	0
Number Nine: We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.	0
We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.	0
Immigration law doesn't exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals.	0
It exists to protect all aspects of American life -- the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and much else.	0
That is why immigration limits are established in the first place.	0
If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.	0
I will enforce all of our immigration laws.	0
The same goes for government benefits.	0
The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance.	0
This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. treasury.	0
Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for removal.	0
Number 10: We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers	0
We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015.	0
Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country.	0
But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration -- as we have following previous immigration waves -- to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility.	0
Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.	0
The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals:	0
To keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms	0
To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient.	0
We need a system that serves our needs -- remember, it's America First.	0
To choose immigrants based on merit, skill and proficiency	0
And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.	0
We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and properly-vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest.	0
We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago.	0
To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them.	0
We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?	0
Let's talk about the big picture	0
These ten steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last fifty years.	0
Because I am not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I will get this done for you and your family.	0
We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail.	0
Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and welfare use will decrease.	0
We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our inner cities.	0
For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above.	0
Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.	0
We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration.	0
There will be no amnesty.	0
Our message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country.	0
This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays.	0
People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized.	0
Those days are over.	0
In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals -- and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system -- then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain.	0
That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.	0
Right now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis.	0
All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security.	0
That is the only conversation we should be having at this time.	0
Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing -- and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.	0
These are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton.	0
What we do know, despite the total lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement.	0
The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness.	0
This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better.	0
This is it.	0
We won't get another opportunity -- it will be too late.	0
So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for -- and who we are fighting for.	0
So I am going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now.	0
[[PAUSE FOR ANGEL MOMS -- EACH SAYS THE NAME OF THEIR CHILD INTO THE MICROPHONE]]	0
Now is the time for these voices to be heard.	0
Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.	0
Now is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.	0
Let's fix this problem.	0
Let's secure our border.	0
Let's stop the drugs and the crime.	0
Let's protect our Social Security and Medicare.	0
And let's get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country.	0
Together, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.	0
Together, we can save America itself.	0
Join me in this mission to Make America Great Again.	0
Thank you, and God Bless you all!	0
Good evening, I'm Carl Quintanilla, with my colleagues Becky Quick and John Harwood.	0
We'll be joined tonight by some of CNBC's top experts on the markets and personal finance.	0

[ applause ]	0
Governor Mike Huckabee.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Jeb Bush.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Marco Rubio.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Donald Trump.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Ben Carson.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mrs. Carly Fiorina.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Ted Cruz.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor Chris Christie.	0
[ applause ]	0
And Senator Rand Paul.	0
[ applause ]	0
A lot to get to tonight.	0
So let's get started.	0
This first is an open question.	0
This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people.	0
"And in any job interview, you know this: you get asked, ""what's your biggest weakness?"""	0
So in 30 seconds, without telling us that you try too hard or that you're a perfectionist...	0
[ laughter ]	0
...what is your biggest weakness and what are you doing to address it?	0
We'll go left to right.	0
Governor Kasich, 30 seconds.	0
Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.	0
I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out — out in the — in the cold.	0
I've heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 — people here from this country out of this country, splitting families.	0
I've heard about tax schemes that don't add up, that put our kids in — in a deeper hole than they are today.	0
We need somebody who can lead.	0
We need somebody who can balance budgets, cut taxes...	0
Governor?	0
You know, frankly, I did it in Washington, in Ohio, and I will do it again in Washington, if I'm president, to get this country moving again.	0
country moving again.	0
Governor Huckabee.	0
Well, John, I don't really have any weaknesses that I can think of.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But my wife is down here in the front, and I'm sure, if you'd like to talk to her later, she can give you more than you'll ever be able to take care of.	0
If I have a weakness, it's that I try to live by the rules.	0
I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.	0
Play by the rules.	0
And I'll tell you what a weakness is of this country: there are a lot of people who are sick and tired because Washington does not play by the same rules that the American people have to play by.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Governor Bush.	0
You know, I am by my nature impatient.	0
And this is not an endeavor that rewards that.	0
You gotta be patient.	0
You gotta be — stick with it, and all that.	0
But also, I can't fake anger.	0
I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.	0
And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.	0
It's never been that way in American politics before.	0
I can't do it.	0
I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply — you know, going down.	0
I think we're on the verge of the greatest time, and I want to fix the things to let people rise up.	0
Senator Rubio.	0
Thank you for that question.	0
I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.	0
I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.	0
And that doesn't have to be true.	0
Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.	0
If we're willing to do what it takes now, the 21st century is going to be the new American century, greater than any other era we've had in the history of this great nation.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.	0
I'm too trusting.	0
And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.	0
I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.	0
"So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said ""let up."""	0
[ laughter ]	0
Dr. Carson?	0
Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.	0
I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.	0
And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.	0
Mrs. Fiorina?	0
Well, gee, after the last debate, I was told that I didn't smile enough.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Fixed it.	0
But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.	0
I agree with them.	0
And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.	0
Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.	0
We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.	0
Ours was intended to be a citizen government.	0
This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
I'm too agreeable, easy going.	0
[ laughter ]	0
You know, I think my biggest weakness is exactly the opposite.	0
I'm a fighter.	0
I am passionate about what I believe.	0
I've been passionate my whole life about the Constitution.	0
And, you know, for six-and-a-half years, we've had a gigantic party.	0
If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.	0
But if you want someone to drive you home, I will get the job done and I will get you home.	0
Governor Christie?	0
I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.	0
Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.	0
You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.	0
And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.	0
[ laughter ]	0
But I will — but I will tell you this, the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it.	1
The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.	0
But I know who the pessimist is.	0
It's Hillary Clinton.	0
And you put me on that stage against her next September, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.	0
Take it to the bank.	0
Senator Paul?	0
You know, I left my medical practice and ran for office because I was concerned about an $18 trillion debt.	0
We borrow a million dollars a minute.	0
Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.	0
It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.	0
I will stand firm.	0
I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.	0
I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.	0
And I ask everyone in America to call Congress tomorrow and say enough is enough; no more debt.	0
Thanks to all the candidates.	0
John?	0
Mr. Trump, you've done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it.	0
Right.	0
Send 11 million people out of the country.	0
Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit.	0
Right.	0
And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others.	0
That's right.	0
Let's be honest.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Is this a comic book version of a presidential campaign?	0
No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.	0
Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.	0
We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.	0
We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.	0
We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.	0
As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.	0
We're going to create a border.	0
We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.	0
They're going to come in legally.	0
And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.	0
They built the great wall of China.	0
That's 13,000 miles.	0
Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.	0
So we need 1,000.	0
We can do a wall.	0
We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.	0
We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.	0
And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico — I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders — but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.	0
And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay?	0
A politician other than the people in the states — I don't want to — a politician cannot get them to pay.	0
I can.	0
We lose, we have a trade imbalance...	0
Excuse me, John.	0
... of $50 billion...	0
We're at the 60 seconds.	0
... believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.	0
We're at 60 seconds, but I gotta ask you, you talked about your tax plan.	0
You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Hold on, hold on.	0
The economy would take off like a rocket ship.	0
Right.	0
Dynamically.	0
I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties.	0
They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms.	0
Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
The Tax Foundation says — has looked at all of our plans and — and his creates, even with the dynamic effect, $8 trillion dollar deficit...	0
Gentlemen — we'll — we'll get back to this — just a minute — just a minute we're gonna continue this.	0
I wanna talk taxes...	0
Hold it.	0
We'll cut it back to you in just a minute.	0
Becky's moving on.	0
Dr. Carson, let's talk about taxes.	0
You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and — I've looked at it — and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but I've had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this.	0
If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, you're gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion.	0
That is less than half of what we bring in right now.	0
And by the way, it's gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.	0
So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?	0
Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.	0
I used the tithing analogy.	0
I — I understand that, but if you — if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28.	0
The rate — the rate — the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.	0
15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole.	0
You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.	0
You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.	0
Remember, we have 645 federal agencies and sub-agencies.	0
Anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world.	0
So, also, we can stimulate the economy.	0
That's gonna be the real growth engine.	0
Stimulating the economy — because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations...	0
You'd have to cut — you'd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole.	0
That's not true.	0
That is true, I looked at the numbers.	0
When — when we put all the facts down, you'll be able to see that it's not true, it works out very well.	0
Dr. Carson, thank you.	0
Listen, I want to just comment.	0
Governor Kasich, hold it, I'm coming to you right now.	0
The...	0
Well I want to comment on this.	0
This is the fantasy...	0
Well, I'm asking you about this.	0
This is the fantasy that I talked about in the beginning.	0
I'm about to ask you about this.	0
That is, you had some very strong words to say yesterday about what's happening in your party and what you're hearing from the two gentlemen we've just heard from.	0
Would you repeat it?	0
I'm the only person on this stage that actually was involved in the chief architect of balancing the Federal Budget.	0
You can't do it with empty promised.	0
You know, these plans would put us trillions and trillions of dollars in debt.	0
I actually have a plan.	0
I'm the only one on this stage that has a plan that would create jobs, cut taxes, balance the budget and can get it done because I'm realistic.	0
You just don't make promises like this.	0
Why don't we just give a chicken in every pot, while we're, you know, coming up — coming up with these fantasy tax schemes.	0
We'll just clean it up.	0
Where are you gonna clean it up?	0
You have to deal with entitlements, you have to be in a position to control discretionary spending.	0
You gotta be creative and imaginative.	0
Now, let me just be clear, John.	0
I went into Ohio where we had an $8 billion hole and now we have a $2 billion surplus.	0
We're up 347,000 jobs.	0
When I was in Washington, I fought to get the budget balanced.	0
I was the architect.	0
It was the first time we did it since man walked on the moon.	0
We cut taxes and we had a $5 trillion projected surplus when I left.	0
That's was hard work.	0
Fiscal discipline, know what you're doing.	0
Creativity.	0
This stuff is fantasy.	0
Just like getting rid of Medicare and Medicaid.	0
Come on, that's just not — you scare senior citizens with that.	0
It's not responsible.	0
Well, let's just get more pointed about it.	0
You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues.	0
Who were you talking about?	0
Well, I mean right here.	0
To talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government?	0
And we're going to just fix everything with waste, fraud, and abuse?	0
Or that we're just going to be great?	0
Or we're going to ship 10 million Americans — or 10 million people out of this country, leaving their children here in this country and dividing families?	0
Folks, we've got to wake up.	0
We cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job.	0
You have got to pick somebody who has experience, somebody that has the know-how, the discipline.	0
And I spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets, growing jobs, the same in Ohio.	0
And I will go back to Washington with my plan.	0
Governor — Governor.	0
thank you, Governor.	0
And I will have done it within 100 days, and it will pass.	0
And we will be strong again.	0
Thank you.	0
Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.	0
First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK?	0
He hit oil.	0
He got lucky with fracking.	0
Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.	0
Number — and that is important for you to know.	0
Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.	0
And Lehman Brothers started it all.	0
He was on the board.	0
And he was a managing general partner.	0
And just thirdly, he was so nice.	0
He was such a nice guy.	0
And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.	0
But then his poll numbers tanked.	0
He has got — that is why he is on the end.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And he got nasty.	0
And he got nasty.	0
So you know what?	0
You can have him.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Let me just — let me respond.	0
First of all, Ohio does have an energy industry, but we're diversified.	0
We're one of the fastest growing states in the country.	0
We came back from the dead.	0
And you know what?	0
It works very, very well.	0
And secondly, when you talk about me being on the board of Lehman Brothers, I wasn't on the board of Lehman Brothers.	0
I was a banker and I was proud of it.	0
And I traveled the country and learned how people made jobs.	0
We ought to have politicians who not only have government experience but know how the CEOs and the job creators work.	0
My state is doing great across the board.	0
And guess what, in 2011, I got a deal...	0
Governor...	0
... an agreement with the...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... that he tried to take credit for four years later.	0
It's a joke.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Dr. Carson, let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Since I was attacked too.	0
Thank you.	0
Let me just say, if you're talking about an $18 trillion economy, you're talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product.	0
You're talking about $2.7 trillion.	0
We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion.	0
But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.	0
So that is not by any stretch a pie in the sky.	0
Becky, if you want a 10 percent flat tax where the numbers add up, I rolled out my tax plan today, you can find it on line at tedcruz.org.	0
It is a simple flat tax where for individuals, a family of four pays nothing on the first $36,000.	0
After that you pay 10 percent as a flat tax going up.	0
The billionaire and the working man, no hedge fund manager pays less than his secretary.	0
On top of that, there is a business flat tax of 16 percent.	0
Now that applies universally to giant corporations that with lobbyists right now are not paying taxes, and as small business.	0
And you wanted to know the numbers, the Tax Foundation, which has scored every one of our plans, shows that this plan will allow the economy to generate 4.9 million jobs, to raise wages over 12 percent, and to generate 14 percent growth.	0
And it costs, with dynamic scoring, less than a trillion dollars.	0
Those are the hard numbers.	0
And every single income decile sees a double-digit increase in after-tax income.	0
Senator — Senator, thank you.	0
Growth is the answer.	0
And as Reagan demonstrated, if we cut taxes, we can bring back growth.	0
Gentlemen, I'm sorry, we need to...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
We're going to try to move on.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Let me just say on taxes, how long have we been talking about tax reform in Washington, D.C.?	0
We have been talking about it for decades.	0
We now have a 73,000-page tax code.	0
There have been more than 4,000 changes to the tax plan since 2001 alone.	0
There are loads of great ideas, great conservative ideas from wonderful think tanks about how to reform the tax code.	0
The problem is we never get it done.	0
We have talked about tax reform in every single election for decades.	0
It never happens.	0
And the politicians always say it is so complicated, nobody but a politician can figure it out.	0
The truth is this, the big problem, we need a leader in Washington who understands how to get something done, not to talk about it, not to propose it, to get it done.	0
You want to bring 70,000 pages to three?	0
That's right, three pages.	0
Is that using really small type?	0
You know why three?	0
Is that using really small type?	0
No.	0
You know why three?	0
Because only if it's about three pages are you leveling the playing field between the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected who can hire the armies of lawyers and accountants and, yes, lobbyists to help them navigate their way through 73,000 pages.	0
Three pages is about the maximum that a single business owner or a farmer or just a couple can understand without hiring somebody.	0
Almost 60 percent of American people now need to hire an expert to understand their taxes.	0
So yes, you're going to hear a lot of talk about tax reform —	0
Mrs. Fiorina —	0
— the issue is who is going to get it done.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
We're going to —	0
We're going to move on.	0
We will come around the bend, i promise.	0
This one is for Senator Rubio.	0
You've been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s.	0
You've had a big accomplishment in the Senate, an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate, and even you don't support anymore.	0
Now, you're skipping more votes than any senator to run for president.	0
Why not slow down, get a few more things done first or least finish what you start?	0
That's an interesting question.	0
That's exactly what the Republican establishment says too.	0
Why don't you wait in line?	0
Wait for what?	0
This country is running out of time.	0
We can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years.	0
Watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck.	0
They're working as hard as they ever have, everything costs more, and they haven't had a raise in decades.	0
You have small businesses in America that are struggling.	0
For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses closing than starting.	1
We have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies.	0
And our adversaries continue to grow stronger.	0
We have a — they say there's no bipartisanship in Washington?	0
We have a $19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford.	0
The time to act is now.	0
The time to turn the page is now.	0
If we — if we don't act now, we are going to be the first generation in American history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves.	0
So when the Sun-Sentinel says Rubio should resign, not rip us off, when they say Floridians sent you to Washington to do a job, when they say you act like you hate your job, do you?	0
Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement.	0
It's actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today.	0
Well, do you hate your job?	0
Let me — let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today.	0
Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes.	0
I don't recall them calling for his resignation —	0
Is that the standard?	0
Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes.	0
I don't recall the Sun — in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him.	0
In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again.	0
So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator, thank you.	0
John.	0
Could I — could I bring something up here, because I'm a constituent of the senator and I helped him and I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work.	0
He got endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel because he was the most talented guy in the field.	0
He's a gifted politician.	0
But Marco, when you signed up for this, this was a six-year term, and you should be showing up to work.	0
I mean, literally, the Senate — what is it, like a French work week?	0
You get, like, three days where you have to show up?	0
You can campaign, or just resign and let someone else take the job.	0
There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck in Florida as well, they're looking for a senator that will fight for them each and every day.	0
I get to respond, right?	0
Thirty seconds.	0
Well, it's interesting.	0
Over the last few weeks, I've listened to Jeb as he walked around the country and said that you're modeling your campaign after John McCain, that you're going to launch a furious comeback the way he did, by fighting hard in New Hampshire and places like that, carrying your own bag at the airport.	0
You know how many votes John McCain missed when he was carrying out that furious comeback that you're now modeling after?	0
He wasn't my senator.	0
No Jeb, I don't remember — well, let me tell you.	0
I don't remember you ever complaining about John McCain's vote record.	0
The only reason why you're doing it now is because we're running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.	0
Well, I've been —	0
Here's the bottom line.	0
[ applause ]	0
I'm not — my campaign is going to be about the future of America, it's not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage.	0
I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor Bush.	0
I'm not running against Governor Bush, I'm not running against anyone on this stage.	0
I'm running for president because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton to continue the policies of Barack Obama.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
I think you're —	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Hold on.	0
I think there's a — I've got question for —	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
John Harwood, there's a bigger issue here.	0
Hold on, Governor.	0
I've got a question for Governor Bush.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
No, we're moving to Governor Bush.	0
Governor, the fact that you're at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, despite the big investment your donors have made.	0
You noted recently, after slashing your payroll, that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people.	0
I wanted to ask you —	0
No, no.	0
What I said was I don't believe that I would be president of the United States and have the same dysfunction that exists in Washington, D.C. now.	0
OK.	0
Don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in Washington, D.C.	0
Got it.	0
But if you want someone who has a proven, effective leadership, that was a governor of a state, that transformed the culture there, elect me so I can fight for the American people and change the culture in Washington, D.C.	0
But it's a — OK.	0
It's a — it's a question about why you're having difficulty.	0
I want to ask you in this context.	0
Ben Bernanke, who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother, recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism.	0
Is that why you're having a difficult time in this race?	0
[ inaudible ]	0
, the great majority of Republicans and Americans believe in a hopeful future.	0
They don't believe in building walls and a pessimistic view of the future.	0
They're concerned that Washington is so dysfunctional it is holding them back.	0
There are lids on people's aspirations.	0
Think about it: six and a half million people working part-time.	0
Workforce participation rates lower than they were in 1977.	0
Six million more people living in poverty than the day that Barack Obama got elected president, and the left just wants more of the same.	0
We have to offer a compelling alternative that is based on hope and optimism and grounded in serious policy, which I've laid out.	0
And you can go get it at jeb2016.com.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
We're gonna get down the line.	0
Becky's got a question.	0
We'll get to everyone.	0
Ms. Fiorina, I — I'd like to ask you a question.	0
You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard.	0
But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO, and the market was not kind to you.	0
Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left.	0
Obviously, you've talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies, but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer, if you looked at your competitors, if you looked at the overall market.	0
I just wonder, in terms of all of that — you know, we look back, your board fired you.	0
I just wondered why you think we should hire you now.	0
You know, the NASDAQ dropped 80 percent — 80 percent — and it took 15 years for the NASDAQ to recover.	0
I was recruited to H.P.	0
to save a company.	0
It was a company that had grown into a bloated, inept bureaucracy that cost too much and delivered too little to customers and shareholders.	0
It had missed, before I had arrived, expectations for nine quarters in a row.	0
As an outsider, I tackled H.P.	0
's entrenched problems head-on.	0
I cut the bureaucracy down to size, re-introduced accountability, focused on service, on innovation, on leading in every market, in every product segment.	0
And yes, it was a very difficult time.	0
However, we saved 80,000 jobs and we went on to grow to 160,000 jobs, and scores of technology companies literally went out of business — like Gateway — taking all their jobs with them.	0
The truth is I had to make some tough calls in some tough times.	0
I think, actually, people are looking for that in Washington now.	0
And yes, I was fired over a disagreement in the boardroom.	0
There are politics in the boardroom as well.	0
"And yet the man who led my firing, Tom Perkins, an icon of Silicon Valley, has come out publicly and said, ""you know what?"	0
We were wrong.	0
She was right.	0
She was a great CEO.	0
She'd be a great president of the United States because the leadership she brought to H.P.	0
is exactly the leadership we need in Washington, D.C.	0
Mrs. Fiorina, it's interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins, because...	0
[ applause ]	0
...he said a lot of very questionable things.	0
Last year, in an interview, he said that he thinks wealthy people should get more votes than poor people.	0
"I think his quote was that, ""if you pay zero dollars in taxes, you should get zero votes."	0
"If you pay a million dollars, you should get a million votes."""	0
Is this the type of person you want defending you?	0
Well, this is one of the reasons why Tom Perkins and I had disagreements in the boardroom, Becky.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Nevertheless, one of the things that I think people don't always understand is how accountable a CEO actually is.	0
So you know, I had to report results every 90 days in excruciating detail.	0
I had to answer every single question about every single result and every single projection in public until there were no more questions.	0
And if I misrepresented those results or those projections in any way, I was held criminally liable.	0
Imagine — imagine — if a politician were held to that standard of account.	0
I will run on my record all day long.	0
[ applause ]	0
And I believe people need a leader who is prepared to make tough calls in tough times and stand up...	0
Mrs. Fiorina.	0
...and be held accountable.	0
Thank you, we're out of time.	0
Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.	0
Carl.	0
Senator Cruz.	0
Congressional Republicans, Democrats and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of — another Washington-created crisis is on the way.	0
Does your opposition to it show that you're not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?	0
You know, let me say something at the outset.	0
The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media.	0
[ applause ]	0
This is not a cage match.	0
"And, you look at the questions — ""Donald Trump, are you a comic-book villain?"""	0
Ben Carson, can you do math?	0
John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?	0
Marco Rubio, why don't you resign?	0
Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?	0
How about talking about the substantive issues the people care about?	0
[ applause ]	0
[	0
inaudible ] do we get credit	0
[ inaudible ]	0
?	0
And Carl — Carl, I'm not finished yet.	0
"The contrast with the Democratic debate, where every fawning question from the media was, ""Which of you is more handsome and why?"""	0
[ laughter ]	0
And let me be clear.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
So, this is a question about	0
[ inaudible ]	0
, which you have 30 seconds left to answer, should you choose to do so.	0
Let me be clear.	0
The men and women on this stage have more ideas, more experience, more common sense than every participant in the Democratic debate.	0
That debate reflected a debate between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.	0
[ laughter ]	0
And nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a Republican primary.	0
The questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other.	0
It should be what are your substantive positions...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
OK.	0
[ inaudible ]	0
I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
You want me to answer that question?	0
I'm happy to answer the question...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Let me tell you how that question...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Let me tell you how that question...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Paul, I've got a question for you on the same subject.	0
... so you don't actually want to hear the answer, John?	0
Senator Paul?	0
You don't want to hear the answer.	0
You just want to...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
You used your time on something else.	0
Senator Paul?	0
You're not interested in an answer.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator Paul, the budget deal crafted by Speaker Boehner and passed by the House today makes cuts in entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security disability, which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our country's long-term budget deficit.	0
Do you oppose that budget deal because it doesn't cut those programs enough?	0
No, I oppose it because you're taking money from the entitlement and then spending it immediately on other items.	0
That's what they're doing.	0
They're taking money from Social Security and they're going to spend it on the military and they're going to spend it on domestic spending.	0
Here's the thing.	0
When you look at raising the debt limit, it should be leverage to try to reform government.	0
In 2011, the sequester was passed as a reform to slow down the rate of government.	0
Instead, the Washington establishment raised both.	0
We raised the military spending, took from entitlements, and raised domestic spending and the deficit will explode under this.	0
This is the unholy alliance that people need to know about between right and left.	0
Right and left are spending us into oblivion.	0
We should use the debt ceiling, as precisely to Don, to force upon them budgetary reforms.	0
Senator, if what you just said is true, why did Speaker Boehner craft this deal and why did Paul Ryan, who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline, vote for it?	0
Well, that's a real question.	0
Is there going to be any change in the House with new leadership?	0
I frankly don't think there will be much change because I think what's going to happen is you're going to get more of the same.	0
People in Washington think they were sent there to be adults and govern and do all this.	0
Well, you know what I'm worried about?	0
Not keeping the government open.	0
I'm worried about bankrupting the American people.	0
We're borrowing a million dollars a minute.	0
That is important.	0
And that's what we have to contrast.	0
Keeping the government open and continuing to borrow a million dollars a minute.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Thank you, Senator	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
Governor Christie, I'd like to	0
[ inaudible ]	0
a question next.	0
Actually, I have a question for you	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
In your tell it like it is campaign, you've said a lot of tough things.	0
You've said that we need to raise the retirement age for Social Security.	0
You think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over $80,000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over $200,000.	0
Governor Huckabee, who is here on the stage, has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that they've earned.	0
It raises the question: When it is acceptable to break a social compact?	0
Well, I wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it.	0
I mean, let me be honest with the people who are watching at home.	0
The government has lied to you and they have stolen from you.	0
They told you that your Social Security money is in a trust fund.	0
All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money they spent on something else a long time ago.	0
And they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and Social Security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years.	0
We're sitting up here talking about all these other things; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements, and debt service.	0
And, that's with zero percent interest rates.	0
Now, I'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements.	0
And we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years.	0
And, here's the difference between me and Hillary Clinton.	0
What Hillary Clinton's going to say, and has said before is, she wants to raise Social Security taxes.	0
Now, let me ask you a question everybody, and, this is for the guy, you know, who owns a landscaping business out there.	0
If somebody's already stolen money from you, are you going to give them more?	0
Or, are you going to deal with the problem by saying, I'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend.	0
We need to get realistic about this.	0
We're not — the American people — forget about anything else, they've already been lied to and stolen from.	0
And...	0
...Governor...	0
...I'm going to go to Washington to stop it...	0
...Thank you.	0
We promised we would get to everyone this block.	0
Governor Huckabee, I'm going to give you 60 seconds on this.	0
Well, I would really appreciate that.	0
First of all, yes, we've stolen.	0
Yes, we've lied to the American people about Social Security, and Medicare.	0
But, you know what we're not telling them?	0
It's their money.	0
This isn't the governments money.	0
This is not entitlement, it's not welfare.	0
This is money that people have confiscated out of their paychecks.	0
Everytime they got a paycheck, the government reached in and took something out of it before they ever saw it.	0
Now, we're going to blame the people.	0
Today congress decided to take another $150 billion dollars away from Social Security so they can borrow more money.	0
That makes no sense to everybody.	0
"And, they're always going to say, ""Well, we're going to fix this one day."""	0
No their not.	0
"It's like a 400 pound man saying, ""I'm going to go on a diet, but I'm eating a sack of Krispy Kremes before I do."""	0
And, people are sick of believing that the government is never going to really address this.	0
But, let me tell you who not to blame.	0
Let's quit blaming the people on Social Security.	0
Let's quit making it a problem for them.	0
It's like them getting mugged, and then us saying, well, we're going to mug you some more.	0
You ought to just be able to get over it, get used to it...	0
...Governor...	0
...No, sir...	0
...Thank you, Governor...	0
...we need to honor our promises...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...Senator Cruz...	0
...before I go.	0
This is the only time I've had a chance, let me finish.	0
OK, alright.	0
...This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality.	0
If this country that does not keep its promise to seniors then what promise can this country hope to be trusted to keep?	0
And, the fact is, none of them.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
And, by the way, Carl...	0
[ applause ]	0
And, the only way — no...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...The only way we're going to be morale, the only way we're going to keep our promise to seniors is start by following the first rule we should all follow, which is to look at them, treat them like adults, and tell them the truth.	0
It isn't there anymore, Mike.	0
They stole it.	0
It got stolen from them.	0
It's not theirs anymore.	0
The government stole it, and spent it a long time ago...	0
...Chris...	0
So, let's stop fooling around about this, let's tell people the truth.	0
For once, let's do that, and stop trying to give them some kind of fantasy that's never going to come true.	0
Senator Cruz...	0
...Chris...	0
...Before we go to break, we're clearly not having that beer you mentioned, but I'll give you 30 more seconds...	0
...Then I'll buy you a tequila...	0
OK.	0
...Or, even some famous Colorado brownies.	0
I'll give you 30 seconds to respond...[	0
cheering ]	0
[ inaudible ]	0
Since he brought me up, do I not get to respond?	0
Respond on the debt limit, or an answer to the governor, which ever you choose.	0
Well, sure.	0
This deal in Washington is an example of why Washington's broken.	0
Republican leadership joined with every single Democrat, add $80 trillion to our debt to do nothing to fix the problems.	0
And, let me now on Social Security because we were getting into a good substantive exchange, and I want to say I think both Chris, and Mike are right.	0
Governor Huckabee's exactly right, we need to honor the promises made to our seniors, but for younger workers — look.	0
I'm 44 years old.	0
It is hard to find someone in my generation that thinks Social Security will be there for us.	0
We can save and preserve and strengthen Social Security by making no changes for seniors, but for younger workers gradually increasing the retirement age, changing the rate of growth so that it matches inflation, and critically allowing younger workers to keep a portion of our tax payments in a personal account that we own, we control them, we can pass on to our kids.	0
30 seconds, Governor Huckabee.	0
John, listen, let's keep in mind that for one-third of the 60 million Americans on Social Security it represents 90 percent of their income.	0
And, when I hear people talking about means testing, let's just remember what that means.	0
If we means test Social Security, it means that the government decides whether or not I deserve it.	0
If a person lives in a seven room house, does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms, we're going to take two of them away?	0
Folks, the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in.	0
I just want to remind you, people paid their money.	0
They expect to have it.	0
And, if this government doesn't pay it, than tell me what's different between the government and Bernie Madolf, who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and Medicare in this country.	0
[ applause ]	0
Governor, thank you.	0
We will take a break.	0
The Republican Presidential debate, live from Boulder, Colorado, coming back after a break on CNBC.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the presidential debate for the Republicans.	0
We are live in Boulder, Colorado, right here on CNBC.	0
Folks, we'll get right back into this.	0
Mr. Trump, let's talk a little bit about bankruptcies.	0
Your Atlantic City casinos filed for bankruptcy four times.	0
In fact, Fitch, the ratings agency, even said that they were serial filers for all of this.	0
You said that you did great with Atlantic City, and you did.	0
But some of the individuals — the bondholders, some of the contractors who worked for you, didn't fare so well.	0
Bankruptcy is a broken promise.	0
Why should the voters believe the promises that you're telling them right now?	0
Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.	0
Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.	0
Atlantic City has gone bad.	0
I mean, Chris will know about that.	0
I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.	0
Caesar's — excuse me — Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.	0
Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy — the biggest.	0
But also the biggest people (ph) — now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.	0
I never filed for bankruptcy.	0
But many, many people did.	0
What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.	0
Now hundreds of companies I've opened.	0
I've used it three times, maybe four times.	0
Came out great.	0
But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.	0
That is what I could do for the country.	0
We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.	0
Nobody can solve it like me.	0
But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.	0
I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.	0
And I'm glad I did it.	0
I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.	0
Mr. Trump, thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
Dr. Carson, in recent weeks, a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering, for dramatically raising the prices of life-saving drugs.	0
You have spent a lifetime in medicine.	0
Have these companies gone too far?	0
Should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases?	0
Well, there is no question that some people go overboard when it comes to trying to make profits, and they don't take into consideration the American people.	0
What we have to start thinking about, as leaders, particularly in government, is what can we do for the average American?	0
And you think about the reasons that we're having such difficulty right now with our job market.	0
Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee.	1
Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else.	0
So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on.	0
The government is not supposed to be in every part of our lives, and that is what is causing the problem.	0
Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
Governor Christie, there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis.	0
But General Motors paid more than $1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect.	0
One hundred and twenty- four people died as a result of these faulty switches.	0
No one went to jail.	0
As a former prosecutor, do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the cover-up belong behind bars?	0
You bet they do.	0
And if I were the prosecutor, that is exactly where they would be.	0
The fact is that this Justice Department under this president has been a political Justice Department.	0
It has been a Justice Department that decided that they want to pick who the winners and losers are.	0
They like General Motors, so they give them a pass.	0
They don't like somebody else like David Petraeus, they prosecute them and send a decorated general on to disgrace.	0
It's a political Justice Department.	0
And, Jim, you know full well that in the seven years I was U.S. attorney we went after pharmaceutical companies.	0
We went after companies that were ripping off shareholders.	0
We went after companies that were doing things that were against the law.	0
And to expand on Mr. Carson's — or Dr. Carson's question, let's face it, we have laws already.	0
We don't need newer (ph) laws.	0
We don't need Hillary Clinton's price controls for — again, does anybody out there think that giving Washington, D.C., the opportunity to run the pharmaceutical industry is a good idea, given how well they have done running the government?	0
So what we do, though, is, if there is somebody who is price- gouging, we have laws for prosecutors to take that on.	0
Let's let a Justice Department — and I will make an attorney general who will enforce the law and make justice more than just a word.	0
It will be a way of life.	0
Thank you, Governor Christie.	0
Jim, thanks.	0
Governor Bush, in a debate like this four years ago, every Republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large.	0
A few months later, you told Congress, put me in, coach, you said you would take that deal.	0
Still feel that way?	0
Well, the deal was done.	0
Barack Obama got his massive tax increase, and there was no spending cuts.	0
You just see the recent deal announced today or yesterday, more spending, more tax increasing, more regulation.	0
And now we have to accept 2 percent, the new normal for economic growth.	0
And the net result is the middle class has $2,300 less in their pockets than the day that Barack Obama got elected president.	0
And now they see Hillary Clinton proposing a third term of economic policy for our country.	0
We need to reverse that.	0
And my record was one of cutting taxes each and every year.	0
You don't have to guess about it, because I actually have a record.	0
$19 billion of tax cuts, 1.3 million jobs created.	0
We were one of two states to go to AAA bond rating, and our government spending was far less than the spending in people's income.	0
But to — to the point that you made to Congress, if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar...	0
You find me...	0
...one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts, would you take it?	0
You find me a Democrat — you find me a Democrat that will cut spending ten dollars?	0
Heck, find me a Republican in Congress that would cut spending ten dollars.	0
I'll talk to them.	0
So you don't want the coach to put you in any more?	0
Look, the — the deal is already done.	0
The biggest tax increase happened under the watch of Barack Obama, and spending's gone up.	0
You find a Democrat that's for cutting taxes — cutting spending ten dollars, I'll give them a warm kiss.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Thank you, governor.	0
Carl?	0
Mrs. Fiorina, in 2010, while running for Senate in Tech Ridge (ph), California, you called an Internet sales tax a bad idea.	0
Traditional brick and mortar stores obviously disagree.	0
Now that the Internet shopping playing field has matured, what would be a fair plan to even that playing field?	0
You know, I want to go back for a moment to what we were just talking about.	0
Crony capitalism is alive and well, and has been so in Washington, D.C. for decades.	0
What's crony capitalism?	0
Crony capitalism is what happens when government gets so big and so powerful that only the big and the powerful can handle it.	0
So why are the pharmaceutical companies consolidating?	0
Why are there five even bigger Wall Street banks now, instead of the ten we used to have on Wall Street?	0
Because when government gets big and powerful, the big feel like they need to get even bigger to deal with all that power, and meanwhile, the small and the powerless — in this case, 1,590 community banks — go out of business.	0
You see, folks, this is how socialism starts.	0
Government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem.	0
This is why, fundamentally, we have to take our government back.	0
The student loan problem has been created by government.	0
Government trying to level the playing field between Internet and brick-and-mortar creates a problem.	0
"The FCC jumping in now and saying, ""we're going to put 400 pages of regulation over the Internet,"" is going to create massive problems."	0
But guess who pushed for that regulation?	0
The big Internet companies.	0
This is what's going on.	0
Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage.	0
It's why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid.	0
It's why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together.	0
It's you see the health insurance companies getting together.	0
It's why you see the banks consolidating.	0
And meanwhile, small businesses are getting crushed.	0
Community- based businesses and farms are getting crushed.	0
Community banks are going out of business.	0
Big government favors the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected, and crushes the small and the powerless.	0
Mrs. Fiorina.	0
It is why we have to simplify.	0
It is why we have to reduce the size and power of government.	0
OK.	0
It's the only way to level the playing field between big and powerful and small and powerless.	0
Thank you very much.	0
[ applause ]	0
Senator Rubio, you yourself have said that you've had issues.	0
You have a lack of bookkeeping skills.	0
You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money.	0
You faced (ph) foreclosure on a second home that you bought.	0
And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund.	0
That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties.	0
In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy.	0
What do you say?	0
Well, you just — you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all.	1
But I'm going to tell you the truth.	0
Here's the truth.	0
I didn't inherit any money.	0
My dad was a bartender, my mother was a maid.	0
They worked hard to provide us the chance at a better life.	0
They didn't save enough money for us to go to school.	0
I had to work my way through school.	0
I had to borrow money to go to school.	0
I tried (ph), early in my marriage, explaining to my wife why someone named Sallie Mae was taking $1,000 out of our bank account every month.	0
[ laughter ]	0
I know what it's like to owe that money, and we've worked hard.	0
We've worked hard our whole life to provide a better family — a better life for our family.	0
We own a home four blocks away from the place that I grew up in.	0
My four children have been able to receive a good Christian education, and I've been able to save for them to go to college so they never have to have the loans that I did.	0
But I'm not worried about my finances, I'm worried about the finances of everyday Americans who today are struggling in an economy that is not producing good paying jobs while everything else costs more.	0
And that's what this economy needs to — that's what this debate needs to be about.	0
This debate needs to be about the men and women across this country that are struggling on a daily basis to provide for their families the better future that we've always said this country is all about.	0
Senator, I understand all of that.	0
I had a lot of student loans when I got out, too.	0
But you've had a windfall that a lot of Americans haven't.	0
You made over a million dollars on a book deal, and some of these problems came after that.	0
And I used it to pay off my loans.	0
And it's available on paperback, if you're interested in buying my book.	0
[ applause ]	0
But you — but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact, and that cost you about $24,000 out of that in taxes and feed.	0
That — that was after you'd already come into that windfall.	0
That's why I raised the question.	0
Yeah, again, as I said, we're raising a family in the 21st century and it's one of the reasons why my tax plan is a pro- family tax plan.	0
It increases the per child tax credit, because I didn't read about this in a book.	0
I know for a fact how difficult it is to raise children, how expensive it's become for working families.	0
And I make a lot more than the average American.	0
Imagine how hard it is for these people out there that are making 40, 50, $60,000 a year, and they're trying to provide for their families at a time when this economy is not growing.	0
We can't afford another four years of that.	0
Which is what we're gonna get if we elect a big government liberal like Hillary Clinton to the White House.	0
Thank you, senator.	0
Governor John Kasich, you've called for abolishing the Export Import Bank, which provides subsidies to help American companies compete with overseas competitors.	0
You call that corporate welfare.	0
One of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial, said they found that strange, writing, that if that's corporate welfare, what does Kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort — jobs Ohio.	0
If subsidies are good enough for Ohio companies, why aren't they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas?	0
Well, first of all, when we talk about the Import Export Bank, it's time to clean up corporate welfare.	0
If we're gonna reform welfare for poor people, we ought to reform it for rich people, as well.	0
Secondly, in our state, we went from a loss of 350,000 jobs to, now, a gain of 347,000 jobs to the positive.	0
Our wages are growing faster than the national average, and I've cut taxes more than any sitting governor in this state — $5 billion, including no taxes on small business and killing the death tax.	0
I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier, this budget deal in Washington.	0
This is the same old stuff since I left.	0
You spend the money today and then you hope you're going to save money tomorrow.	0
I don't know if people understand, but I spent a lifetime with my colleagues getting us to a federal balanced budget.	0
We actually did it.	0
And I have a road map and a plan right now to get us to balance.	0
Reforming entitlements, cutting taxes.	0
You see, because if you really want to get to a balanced budget, you need to reduce your expenses and you need to grow your economy.	0
So what I will tell you about our incentives — our incentives are tight, and at the end of the day we make sure that we gain more from the creation of jobs than what we lose.	0
And you know what?	0
Ohio, one of the best growing places in the country — I not only did it in Washington, I did it in Ohio, and I'll go back to Washington, and there will be no more silly deals...	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
...	0
If I become President because we'll have a Constitutional Amendment to require a federally balanced budget so they will do their job.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Thank you.	0
Yes, thank you John.	0
Senator Cruz, working women in this country still earn just 77 percent of what men earn.	0
And I know that you've said you've been very sympathetic to our cause.	0
But you've also you said that the Democrats' moves to try and change this are the political show votes.	0
I just wonder what you would do as President to try and help in this cause?	0
Well, we've gotta turn the economy around for people who are struggling.	0
The Democrats' answer to everything is more government control over wages, and more empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits.	0
You know, you look at women working.	0
I'll tell you, in my family there are a lot of single moms in my family.	0
My sister was a single mom, both of my aunts who were a single moms.	0
My mom who's here today, was a single mom when my father left us when I was 3 years old.	0
Now, thank God, my father was invited to a Bible study and became born again and he came back to my mom and me and we were raised together.	0
But I — the struggle of single moms is extraordinary.	0
And you know, when you see Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and all the Democrats talking about wanting to address the plight of working women, not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty.	0
Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.	1
The the truth of the matter is, big government benefits the wealthy, it benefits the lobbyists, it benefits the giant corporations.	0
And the people who are getting hammered are small businesses, it's single moms, it's Hispanics.	0
That is who I'm fighting for.	0
The people that Washington leaves behind.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Becky, it is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman President, when every single policy she espouses, and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstrably bad for women.	0
92 percent — 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.	1
Senator Cruz is precisely right.	0
Three million women have fallen into poverty under this administration.	0
The number of women —	0
Mrs. Fiorina —	0
— living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record.	0
I am a conservative because I know our values, our principles and our policies —	0
Mrs. Fiorina, we will come back to you.	0
— work better to lift everyone up, men and women.	0
Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.	0
Carl?	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, we know you as a physician, but we wanted to ask you about your involvement on some corporate boards, including Costco's.	0
Last year, a marketing study called the warehouse retailer the number one gay-friendly brand in America, partly because of its domestic partner benefits.	0
Why would you serve on a company whose policies seem to run counter to your views on homosexuality?	0
Well, obviously, you don't understand my views on homosexuality.	0
I believe that our Constitution protects everybody, regardless of their sexual orientation or any other aspect.	0
I also believe that marriage is between one man and one woman.	0
And there is no reason that you can't be perfectly fair to the gay community.	0
They shouldn't automatically assume that because you believe that marriage is between one man and one woman that you are a homophobe.	0
And this is one of the myths that the left perpetrates on our society, and this is how they frighten people and get people to shut up.	0
You know, that's what the PC culture is all about, and it's destroying this nation.	0
The fact of the matter is we the American people are not each other's enemies, it's those people who are trying to divide us who are the enemies.	0
And we need to make that very clear to everybody.	0
[ applause ]	0
One more question.	0
This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship.	1
They offered claims that they could cure autism, cancer, they paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet you're involvement continued.	1
Why?	0
Well, that's easy to answer.	0
I didn't have an involvement with them.	0
That is total propaganda, and this is what happens in our society.	0
Total propaganda.	0
I did a couple of speeches for them, I do speeches for other people.	0
They were paid speeches.	0
It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.	1
Do I take the product?	0
Yes.	0
I think it's a good product.	0
To be fair, you were on the homepage of their website with the logo over your shoulder —	0
If somebody put me on their homepage, they did it without my permission.	0
Does that not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way.	0
No, it speaks to the fact that I don't know those —	0
[ audience boos ]	0
See?	0
They know.	0
[ applause ]	0
Apparently.	0
We will take a break.	0
We'll be back in Boulder in just a minute.	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate on CNBC, live from Boulder, Colorado at the University of Colorado.	0
"Senator Huckabee, I mean — excuse me — Senator Rubio, Wired magazine recently carried the headline, ""Marco Rubio wants to be the tech industry's savior."""	0
It noted your support for dramatically increasing immigration visas called H1B, which are designed for workers with the special skills that Silicon Valley wants.	0
But your Senate colleague, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, says in reality, the tech industry uses this program to undercut hiring and wages for highly qualified Americans.	0
Why is he wrong?	0
Well, first of all, if a company gets caught doing that, they should never be able to use the program again.	0
If you get caught abusing this program, you should never be able to use it again.	0
The second thing I said is we need to add reforms, not just increase the numbers, but add reforms.	0
For example, before you hire anyone from abroad, you should have to advertise that job for 180 days.	0
You also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else, so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor.	0
But here's the best solution of all.	0
We need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century.	0
Why, for the life of me, I do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in America, people that can work with their hands; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work.	0
But the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so Americans have the skills for those jobs.	0
But in the interim, in the absence of that, what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those — those centers (ph) to Canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here.	0
But the ideal scenario is to train Americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad.	0
It sounds like you think Senator Sessions is wrong to believe there is enough abuse in that program that we shouldn't...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Well, I believe that there are abuses, those companies should be permanently barred from ever using the program again and we should put strict standards in place to ensure that they're not being abused, like the prevailing wage requirement and like the advertising requirement.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Becky?	0
Mr. Trump, let's stay on this issue of immigration.	0
You have been very critical of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these H1Bs.	0
I was not at all critical of him.	0
I was not at all.	0
In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.	0
They go to Harvard.	0
They go to Yale.	0
They go to Princeton.	0
They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.	0
I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.	0
So you're in favor of...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
So I have nothing at all critical of him.	0
Where did I read this and come up with this that you were...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Probably, I don't know — you people write the stuff.	0
I don't know where you... [	0
laughter ]	0
[ applause ]	0
And if I could say just one thing.	0
I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.	0
I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.	0
And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous — so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.	0
Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?	0
But I will be putting — I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.	0
SuperPacs are a disaster.	0
They're a scam.	0
They cause dishonesty.	0
And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.	0
And I'm not blaming these folks — well, I guess I could.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Very good people are making very bad decisions right now.	0
And if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions, I will tell you, you better get rid of the SuperPacs because they causing a big problem with this country, not only in dishonesty and what's going on, but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests.	0
You know, Mr. — you know, Mr. Trump, if I may	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
You've been — you have been — you had talked a little bit about Marco Rubio.	0
I think you called him Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator because he was in favor of the H1B.	1
I never said that.	0
I never said that.	0
So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?	0
You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not...	0
My apologies.	0
I'm sorry.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
... he's really doing some bad...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Since I've been mentioned, can I respond?	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Yes, you can.	0
OK.	0
I know the Democrats have the ultimate SuperPac.	0
It's called the mainstream media who every single day...	0
[ applause ]	0
... and I'll tell you why.	0
Last week, Hillary Clinton went before a committee.	0
"She admitted she had sent e-mails to her family saying, ""Hey, this attack at Benghazi was caused by Al Qaida-like elements."""	0
She spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the American people that it was because of a video.	0
And yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in Hillary Clinton's campaign.	0
It was the week she got exposed as a liar.	0
It was the week that she got exposed as a liar...	0
[ applause ]	0
But she has her super PAC helping her out, the American mainstream media.	0
Senator Rubio, thank you very much.	0
I would like to introduce my colleague, Rick Santelli, he has some comments as well, sir.	0
Senator Cruz, let's focus on our central bank, the Federal Reserve.	0
You've been a fierce critic of the Fed, arguing for more transparency.	0
Where do you want to take that?	0
Do you want to get Congress involved in monetary policy, or is it time to slap the Fed back and downsize them completely?	0
What are your thoughts?	0
What do you believe?	0
Well, Rick, it's a very important question.	0
I have got deep concerns about the Fed.	0
The first thing I think we need to do is audit the Fed.	0
And I am an original co-sponsor of Rand Paul's audit the Fed legislation.	0
The second thing we need to do is I think we need to bring together a bipartisan commission to look at getting back to rules- based monetary policy, end this star chamber that has been engaging in this incredible experiment of quantitative easing, QE1, QE2, QE3, QE- infinity.	0
And the people who are being impacted, you know, a question that was asked earlier, Becky asked, was about working women.	0
You know, it's interesting, you look at on Wall Street, the Fed is doing great.	0
It's driving up stock prices.	0
Wall Street is doing great.	0
You know, today, the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our income than any year since 1928.	0
But if you look at working men and women.	0
If you look at a single mom buying groceries, she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent.	0
She sees her cost of electricity going up.	0
She sees her health insurance going up.	0
And loose money is one of the major problems.	0
We need sound money.	0
And I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound money and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold.	0
Senator Paul, the same question to you.	0
Well, thank you very much.	0
I would like to thank Ted for co-sponsoring my bill, audit the Fed.	0
And I think it's precisely because of the arrogance of someone like Ben Bernanke, who now calls us all know-nothings, that is precisely why we need audit the Fed.	0
I think it is really very much a huge problem that an organization as powerful as the Fed comes in, lobbies against them being audited on the Hill.	0
I would prevent them lobbying Congress.	0
I don't think the Fed should be involved with lobbying us.	0
I think we should examine how the Fed has really been part of the problem.	0
You want to study income inequality, let's bring the Fed forward and talk about Fed policy and how it causes income inequality.	0
Let's also bring the Fed forward and have them explain how they caused the housing boom and the crisis, and what they've done to make us better or worse.	0
I think the Fed has been a great problem in our society.	0
What you need to do is free up interest rates.	0
Interest rates are the price of money, and we shouldn't have price controls on the price of money.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
[ applause ]	0
Dr. Carson, you told The Des Moines Register that you don't like government subsidies, it interferes with the free market.	0
But you've also said that you're in favor of taking oil subsidies and putting them towards ethanol processing.	0
Isn't that just swapping one subsidy for another, Doctor?	0
Well, first of all, I was wrong about taking the oil subsidy.	0
I have studied that issue in great detail.	0
And what I have concluded is that the best policy is to get rid of all government subsidies, and get the government out of our lives, and let people rise and fall based on how good they are.	0
And — you know, all of this too big to fail stuff and picking and choosing winners and losers — this is a bunch of crap, and it is really causing a great deal of — great deal of problems for our society right now.	0
And — and — you know, it goes back to the whole concept of regulations, which are in everything.	0
The reason that I — I hate them so much is because every single regulation costs in terms of goods and services.	0
That cost gets passed on to the people.	0
Now, who are the people who are hurt by that?	0
It's poor people and middle class.	0
Doesn't hurt rich people if their bar of soap goes up ten cents, but it hurts the poor and the middle class.	0
And Bernie Sanders will tell them that it's because of the rich.	0
Well, I'll tell you something: you can take everything from the top 1 percent, and you apply it to our fiscal gap, and you won't even make a dent in it.	0
Thank you, Doctor.	0
Becky?	0
Rick, thank you very much.	0
Governor Huckabee, you have railed against income inequality.	0
You've said that some Wall Street executives should have gone to jail over the roles that they played during the financial crisis.	0
Apart from your tax plan, are there specific steps you would require from corporate America to try and reduce the income inequality.	0
I don't think it's so much about when the government orders a corporation to do something.	0
In fact, that's part of the problem.	0
If you saw that blimp that got cut loose from Maryland today, it's a perfect example of government.	0
I mean, what we had was something the government made — basically a bag of gas — that cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it, so we had to keep it.	0
That is our government today.	0
We saw it in the blimp.	0
[ applause ]	0
That's exactly what we saw.	0
So look, corporations ought to exercise some responsibility.	0
When CEO income has risen 90 percent above the average worker, when the bottom 90 percent of this country's economy has had stagnant wages for the past 40 years, somebody is taking it in the teeth.	0
And it's not the folks on Wall Street.	0
I'm not anti-Wall Street, but I don't believe the government ought to wear a team jersey, pick winners and losers.	0
Governor?	0
The government ought to wear a striped shirt and just make sure the game...	0
Governor?	0
...is paid — played fairly.	0
Thank you.	0
Now, everybody else has fudged their time and gone over, so please, don't cut me off too quick, Becky.	0
All right, Governor Huckabee.	0
Let me just close it out this way.	0
How about 15 more seconds?	0
We need to be focusing on what fixes this country.	0
And I'll tell you one thing that we never talk about — we haven't talked about it tonight.	0
"Why aren't we talking about — instead of cutting benefits for old people, cutting benefits for sick people — why don't we say, ""let's cure the four big cost-driving diseases..."	0
Governor?	0
"...""diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's?"""	0
Governor, I'm sorry...	0
If you do that, you don't just change the economy, you transform the lives of millions of hurting Americans.	0
Governor, thank you.	0
Gosh, I'd love for us to talk about something like that.	0
Thank you.	0
Governor, thank you.	0
Appreciate it.	0
John?	0
Governor Bush, the tax reform bill that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986 cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent — just like your plan does.	0
But President Reagan taxed capital gains at the same rate, while you would tax them at just 20 percent.	0
Given the problems we've been discussing, growing gap between rich and poor, why would you tax labor at a higher rate than income from investments?	0
Look, the — the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family.	0
And if you make $40,000 a year, a family of four, you don't pay any income tax at all.	0
Simplifying the code and lowering rates, both for corporations and — and personal rates, is exactly what we need to do.	0
You think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost — that's why small businesses are closing, rather than being formed in our country right now.	0
The big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this.	0
And what I think all of us are saying is, our monetary policy, our tax policy, regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise.	0
The government has tried it their way.	0
Under — under Barack Obama and the proposals of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and others, they've tried it their way, and it has failed miserably.	0
We need to take a new approach of taxing — reforming how we tax, and reforming the regulations in our — in our country before it's too late.	0
Senator Rubio, 30 seconds to you.	0
The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale.	0
Since you're the champion of Americans living paycheck-to- paycheck, don't you have that backward?	0
No, that's — you're wrong.	0
In fact, the largest after- tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan.	0
And there's a bunch of things my tax plan does to help them.	0
Number one, you have people in this country that...	0
The Tax Foundation — just to be clear, they said the...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...you wrote a story on it, and you had to go back and correct it.	0
No, I did not.	0
You did.	0
No, you did.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Senator, the Tax Foundation said after-tax income for the top 1 percent under your plan would go up 27.9 percent.	0
Well, you're talking about — yeah.	0
And people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15 percent.	0
Yeah, but that — because the math is, if you — 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand.	0
So yeah, someone who makes more money...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...numerically, it's gonna be higher.	0
But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan, and here's why: because in addition to a general personal exemption, we are increasing the per-child tax credit for working families.	0
We are lowering taxes on small business.	0
You know, a lot of business activity in America is conducted like the guy that does my dry cleaning.	0
He's an S corporation.	0
He pays on his personal rate, and he is paying higher than the big dry-cleaning chain down the street, because he's paying at his personal rate.	0
Under my plan, no business, big or small, will pay more than 25 percent flat rate on their business income.	0
That is a dramatic tax decrease for hard-working people who run their own businesses.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...The other thing I'd like to make about our plan, one more point, it is the most pro growth tax plan that I can imagine because it doesn't tax investments at all.	0
You know why?	0
Because the more you tax something, the less of it you get.	0
I want to be in — I want America to be the best...	0
...John...	0
...in the world for people...	0
Senator, thank you.	0
John, I'd like to address this?	0
John, could I follow up on this?	0
...We'll come back around.	0
I want to get to governor Kasich.	0
What are the rules on who gets to follow up.	0
How do we decide on who gets to follow up?	0
I've seen plenty of other people follow up?	0
It's at the moderator discretion.	0
Governor Kasich, let's talk ...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...about Marijuana, Governor Kasich...	0
I'd like to just mention something about my tax plan, and how it relates to the discussion...	0
Alright, but 30 seconds, you made a case.	0
Sure, 30 seconds.	0
Alright.	0
Much of the discussion is centered over whether or not the different tax plans help, or affect the middle class.	0
In fact, it's the chief argument by democrats against many of the different flat tax proposals.	0
Mine is unique in the sense that my tax plan actually gets rid of the payroll tax as well.	0
It shifts it to the business, and it would allow middle class people to get a tax cut.	0
If you just cut their income tax, there isn't much income tax to cut.	0
Mine actually cuts the payroll tax, and I think it would spread the tax cut across all socioeconomic levels, and would allow then it to be something that would be broadly supported by the public in an election.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
Let me say on that...	0
Oh, no, no, no...	0
...Rand is exactly right.	0
His plan is a good plan, and I will note that my 10% plan also eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax,	0
...Ok...	0
...eliminates the business...	0
[ inaudible ]	0
...income tax...	0
What are you doing?	0
...10% flat rate...	0
...We're going to go to...	0
...is the lowest personal rate any candidate up here has, and what it would also enable us to do is for every citizen to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can eliminate the IRS.	0
[ cheering and pplause ]	0
OK.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Kasich, let's talk about marijuana.	0
We're broadcasting from Colorado which has seen $150 million in new revenue for the state since legalizing last year.	0
Governor Hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization, but he's said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it, they're just now paying taxes.	0
Given the budget pressures in Ohio, and other states, is this a revenue stream you'd like to have?	0
Well, first of all, we're running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we're not having a revenue problem right now.	0
And, sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster.	0
Drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country, and I spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses, and it goes on and on.	0
We could do a whole show on that.	0
I want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality.	0
My program would move the 104 programs of the federal Department of Education into four block grants, and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country.	0
The fact is, in order to get this economy moving again, I call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety.	0
I believe that we need to cut these taxes down, we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget, and we need to send power, money, and influence, the welfare department, the education department, job training, infrastructure, Medicaid, all of that out of Washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top, not a one size fits all mentality that they have in Washington.	0
And, that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children, and an ability to see wages rise.	0
Again...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...One more time, in Ohio, our wages are growing faster than the national average.	0
We've cut taxes, balanced budgets, changed the regulatory environment.	0
Folks, you want to —	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
— fix America, this is the formula.	0
It worked for Reagan and it works for our team in Ohio.	0
Thank you.	0
Thank you.	0
We'll be back from Boulder, Colorado in just a moment.	0
[ applause ]	0
[ commercial break ]	0
Welcome back to the University of Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.	0
Mr. Trump, I want to go back to an issue that we were talking about before, the H-1B visas.	0
I found where I read that before.	0
It was from the donaldjtrump.com website and it says — it says that again, Mark Zuckerburg's personal senator, Marco Rubio has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.	0
Are you in favor of H-1Bs or are you opposed to them?	0
I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.	0
And you know what?	0
They can have it anyway you want.	0
You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.	0
I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect — and actually some of these folks I really like a lot — but I'm the only one that can say that.	0
I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given — if I'm given the opportunity to be president.	0
As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have — it's fine.	0
They have to come into this country legally.	0
We have a country of borders.	0
We have a country of laws.	0
We have to obey the laws.	0
It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.	0
Thank you, sir.	0
I was mentioned in the question.	0
You were.	0
You get 30 seconds.	0
Thank you.	0
Well, I've learned the rules on this.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Look, in addition to what Donald was saying is we also need to talk about the legal immigration system for permanent residents.	0
Today, we have a legal immigration system for permanent residency that is largely based on whether or not you have a relative living here.	0
And that's the way my parents came legally in 1956.	0
But in 2015, we have a very different economy.	0
Our legal immigration system from now on has to be merit-based.	0
It has to be based on what skills you have, what you can contribute economically, and most important of all, on whether or not you're coming here to become an American, not just live in America, but be an American.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Carl?	0
Mr. Trump, you've said you have a special permit to carry a gun in New York.	0
Yes.	0
"After the Oregon mass shooting on October 1st, you said, ""By the way, it was a gun-free zone."	0
"If you had a couple of teachers with guns, you would have been a hell of a lot better off."""	0
Or somebody else.	0
Right.	0
Would you feel more comfortable if your employees brought guns to work?	0
Yes, I might feel more comfortable.	0
I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York — a permit to carry.	0
And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.	0
But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly...	0
[ laughter ]	0
Are you carrying one now?	0
[ laughter ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.	0
[ applause ]	0
But I feel that the gun-free zones and, you know, when you say that, that's target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. That's target.	0
They look around for gun-free zones.	0
You know, we could give you another example — the Marines, the Army, these wonderful six soldiers that were killed.	0
Two of them were among the most highly decorated — they weren't allowed on a military base to have guns.	0
And somebody walked in and shot them, killed them.	0
If they had guns, he wouldn't be around very long.	0
I can tell you, there wouldn't have been much damage.	0
So, I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe.	0
They're a feeding frenzy for sick people.	0
We called a few Trump resorts, a few Trump properties that — that do not allow guns with or without a permit.	0
Would you change those policies?	0
I would change them.	0
I would change them.	0
OK. All right.	0
Thank you.	0
John?	0
Governor Huckabee, you've written about the huge divide in values between middle America and the big coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles.	0
As a preacher as well as a politician, you know that presidents need the moral authority to bring the entire country together.	0
The leading Republican candidate, when you look at the average of national polls right now, is Donald Trump.	0
When you look at him, do you see someone with the moral authority to unite the country?	0
You know, of the few questions I've got, the last one I need is to give him some more time.	0
I love Donald Trump.	0
He is a good man.	0
I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight.	0
Get over that one, OK?	0
[ applause ]	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Is it made in Mexico?	0
I don't know.	0
Where's it made?	0
Is it made in China?	0
Is it made in China or Mexico?	0
I have no idea.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Such a nasty — such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.	0
You're welcome.	0
[ laughter ]	0
Let me tell you, Donald Trump would be a president every day of the week and twice on Sunday, rather than Hillary.	0
I've spent a lifetime in politics fighting the Clinton machine.	0
[ applause ]	0
You want to talk about what we're going to be up against next year?	0
"I'm the only guy on this stage — you know, everybody has an ""only guy"" — ""I'm the only guy this; I'm the only guy that."""	0
Well, let me tell you one thing that I am the only guy: The only guy that has consistently fought the Clinton machine every election I was ever in over the past 26 years.	0
And not only did I fight them, but I beat them.	0
"Somebody says ""I'm a fighter."""	0
Well, I want to know, did you win?	0
Well, I did.	0
And not only did I fight them and win, I lived to tell about it and I'm standing on this stage tonight as evidence of that.	0
And I think that ought to be worth something.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
John, I'll tell you something.	0
You want to talk about moral authority.	0
Let's talk about something that happened this week in the news.	0
You know, the FBI director, the president's appointed FBI director has said this week that because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United States, that police officers are afraid to get out of their cars; that they're afraid to enforce the law.	0
And he says, the president's appointee, that crime is going up because of this.	0
And when the president of the United States gets out to speak about it, does he support police officers?	0
Does he stand up for law enforcement?	0
No, he doesn't.	0
I'll tell you this, the number one job of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of the American people.	0
This president has failed, and when I'm in the Oval Office, police officers will know that they will have the support of the president of the Untied States.	0
That's real moral authority that we need in the Oval Office.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Don't forget my colleague, Sharon Epperson.	0
Thank you, John.	0
Mrs. Fiorina, you were the CEO of a large corporation that offers a 401(k) to its employees.	0
But more than half of American have no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan.	0
That includes the workers at small businesses, and the growing ranks of Uber drivers and other part-timers in the freelance economy.	0
Should the Federal Government play a larger role in helping to set up retirement plans for these workers?	0
No, the Federal Government should not play a larger role.	0
Look, every time the Federal Government gets engaged in something it gets worse.	0
And then the Government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that Hillary Clinton is talking about.	0
Companies should, if they want to attract the best workers, provide a good set of benefits.	0
But honestly, if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed.	0
We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country.	0
How great is that?	0
They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others.	0
The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year.	0
And why?	0
They cite Obamacare.	0
They are refusing to...	0
So you wouldn't agree — you wouldn't agree with a start for 401(k) for businesses or anything like that?	0
I think it's a wonderful that that businesses start a 401(k).	0
The point I'm making is this, the Federal Government should not be in a lot of things.	0
There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government in setting up — retirement plans.	0
There is no Constitutional role for the Federal Government to be setting minimum wages...	0
Thank you very much.	0
...	0
The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, the slower the economy becomes.	0
The more the Government gets engaged in the economy, it is demonstrably true...	0
Thank you, the rules say one minute.	0
...	0
The more the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected are advantaged.	0
Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.	0
We appreciate it.	0
Thank you, thank you.	0
I want to turn my attention now, to you now, Governor Kasich.	0
Most people can't get a college degree without going into debt.	0
Over 40 million Americans have student loans and many of them cannot pay them back.	0
This country has over $100 billion in student loan defaults.	0
That's billion with a b.	0
What will you do to make sure that students, their families, taxpayers, won't feel the economic impact of this burden for generations?	0
Well, first of all, in Ohio we're changing the whole system.	0
Universities will not get paid one dime unless the student graduates or — graduates or completes a course.	0
Secondly, you can be in high school and complete almost an entire first year before you go to college and get credit to do that.	0
And, of course, in addition to that, we are working now to go after the cost drivers in our universities.	0
And let me give you an example.	0
Universities today have so many non-academic assets.	0
At Ohio State they sold the parking garage and the parking lot, and they got $500 million because they shouldn't be in the parking lot business.	0
They shouldn't be in the ding business, they shouldn't be in the dorm business.	0
And, of course, we need to take advantage of on-line education to reduce these costs and begin to dis-intermediate the cost of four years.	0
Now, for those who that have these big high costs, I think we can seriously look at an idea of where you can do public service.	0
I mean legitimate, public service and begin to pay off some of that debt through the public service that you do.	0
And in the meantime, it may inspire us to care more about our country, more about ourselves.	0
This is a big moral issue in America.	0
Living a life bigger than yourself, and being a center of healing and justice.	0
And people can learn it through public service.	0
Thank you, thank you.	0
We don't need the federal government to be involved in this at all.	0
Higher education is the example...	0
We don't need the Federal Government to be involved in this, because when they do we create a $1.2 trillion debt.	0
In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.	1
Let the states do this.	0
You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't in debt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs.	0
It's always a solution of the left to create more Government from the Federal Government.	0
It is broke, it is not working.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Governor Bush, daily fantasy sports has become a phenomenon in this country, will award billions of dollars in prize money this year.	0
But to play you have to assess your odds, put money at risk, wait for an outcome that's out of your control.	0
Isn't that the definition of gambling, and should the Federal Government treat it as such?	0
Well, first of all, I'm 7 and 0 in my fantasy league.	0
I had a feeling you were going to brag about that.	0
Gronkowski is still going strong.	0
I have Ryan Tannehill, Marco, as my quarterback, he was 18 for 19 last week.	0
So I'm doing great.	0
But we're not gambling.	0
And I think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation.	0
Effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all.	0
And when you have insider information, which apparently has been the case, where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it, there has to be some regulation.	0
If they can't regulate themselves, then the NFL needs to look at just, you know, moving away from them a little bit.	0
And there should be some regulation.	0
I have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place, my instinct is to say, hell no, just about everything about the federal government.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
Carl, are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football?	0
[ laughter ]	0
We have — wait a second, we have $19 trillion in debt.	0
We have people out of work.	0
We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us.	0
And we're talking about fantasy football?	0
Can we stop?	0
[ applause ]	0
How about this?	0
How about we get the government to do what they're supposed to be doing, secure our borders, protect our people, and support American values and American families.	0
Enough on fantasy football.	0
Let people play, who cares?	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I want to go back, if I can, to the issue of...	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I want to go back, if I may, to the...	0
"Governor Christie, you've said something that many in your party do not believe, which is that climate change is undeniable, that human activity contributes to it, and you said, quote: ""The question is, what do we do to deal with it?"""	0
So what do we do?	0
Well, first off, what we don't do is do what Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Barack Obama want us to do, which is their solution for everything, put more taxes on it, give more money to Washington, D.C., and then they will fix it.	0
Well, there is no evidence that they can fix anything in Washington, D.C.	0
What should we do?	0
What we should do is to be investing in all types of energy, John, all types of energy.	0
I've laid out...	0
You mean government?	0
No, John.	0
John, do you want me to answer or do you want to answer?	0
[ laughter ]	0
How are we going to do this?	0
[ applause ]	0
Because, I've got to tell you the truth, even in New Jersey what you're doing is called rude.	0
So... 	0
[ laughter ]	0
We've laid out a national energy plan that says that we should invest in all types of energy.	0
I will tell you, you could win a bet at a bar tonight, since we're talking about fantasy football, if you ask who the top three states in America are that produce solar energy: California and Arizona are easy, but number three is New Jersey.	0
Why?	0
Because we work with the private sector to make solar energy affordable and available to businesses and individuals in our state.	0
We need to make sure that we do everything across all kinds of energy: natural gas, oil, absolutely.	0
But also where it's affordable, solar, wind in Iowa has become very affordable and it makes sense.	0
That is the way we deal with global warming, climate change, or any of those problems, not through government intervention, not through government taxes, and for God's sake, don't send Washington another dime until they stop wasting the money they're already sending there.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
Becky.	0
Senator Paul, among the leading conservative opponents to the creation of Medicare back in the 1960s was Ronald Reagan.	0
He warned that it would lead to socialism.	0
Considering the mounting cost of Medicare, was he right to oppose it?	0
The question always is, what works better, the private marketplace or government?	0
And what distributes goods better?	0
It always seems to be the private marketplace does a better job.	0
Is there an area for a safety net?	0
Can you have Medicare or Social Security?	0
Yes.	0
But you ought to acknowledge the government doesn't do a very good job at it.	0
The main problem with Medicare right now is that the average person pays in taxes over their whole lifetime about $100,000.	0
But the average person takes out about $350,000.	0
We have this enormous mismatch because we have smaller and smaller families.	0
When people ask me, whose fault is it?	0
Whose fault is it that Medicare is broken, out of money, that Social Security is broken, out of money?	0
And I say, look, it's not Republicans' fault, it's not Democrats' fault, it's your grandparents' fault for having too many damn kids.	0
[ laughter ]	0
After the war we had all of these kids, Baby Boomers.	0
Now we're having smaller families.	0
We used to have 16 workers for one retiree, now you have three workers for one retiree.	0
It's not working.	0
I have a bill to fix Medicare.	0
I've a bill to fix Social Security.	0
For both of them you have to gradually raise the age.	0
If you're not willing to do that, nobody wants to do it, but if you're not willing to gradually raise the age, you're not serious about fixing either one of them.	0
Senator, thank you.	0
Becky, may I...	0
This is the— well, we're going to take a break.	0
We want to save time for closing statements after the break.	0
So this is the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, and we'll be right back.	0
[ commercial break ] 	0
[ applause ]	0
Welcome back to Boulder, Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.	0
Governor Huckabee, you wanted to respond to the points that Senator Rand Paul was just making when it comes to Social Security.	0
Your time, sir.	0
Well, and specifically to Medicare, Becky, because 85 percent of the cost of Medicare is chronic disease.	0
The fact is if we don't address what's costing so much, we can't throw enough money at this.	0
And it's why I've continued to focus on the fact that we need to declare war on the four big cost drivers because 80 percent of all medical costs in this country are chronic disease.	0
We don't have a health care crisis in America, we have a health crisis.	0
And until we deal with the health of Americans and do what we did with polio — when I was a little kid, we eradicated it.	0
You know how much money we spent on polio last year in America?	0
We didn't spend any.	0
We've saved billions of dollars.	0
You want to fix Medicare?	0
Focus on the diseases that are costing us the trillions of dollars.	0
Alzheimers, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.	0
Eradicate those and you fix Medicare and you've fixed America, its economy and you've made people's lives a heck of a lot better.	0
Becky —	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
[ applause ]	0
— the governor's absolutely right.	0
But we also need to reform Medicare and Social Security.	0
We can't just allow it to continue on its current path the way that Hillary Clinton wants to do because there'll be major reductions in benefits in the next decade if we do nothing.	0
I have a concrete plan to do just that, which allows people to keep HSAs to encourage savings, it allows for people that are retiring with Social Security to be able to get a minimum of 125 percent of the poverty level so that there is a baseline that in this generous country of ours no one goes below.	0
Governor Bush, Mr. Trump says that he is capable of growing the economy so much that Social Security and Medicare don't have to be touched.	0
Do you want to explain how that is going to happen, Mr. Trump?	0
Yes, it's very simple.	0
We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.	0
We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.	0
We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.	0
We're going to cut costs.	0
We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.	0
Governor, you just heard him.	0
You have to reform Social Security, and the simple way to do it is to make sure that the wealthiest don't receive the same benefits as people that are lower-income.	0
And make sure you enhance savings in the private market.	0
The idea of 401(k)s. I have a small business that I set up.	0
It took — it took an arm and a leg to be able to set up a 401(k).	0
Because of all the federal mandates and federal laws, it was too expensive.	0
We need to incent private savings and make sure that Social Security is protected for those that have it.	0
John.	0
But the idea that you can't — that you're just gonna grow your way out of this — I have a plan to grow the economy at 4 percent, but you're gonna have to make adjustments for both Medicare and Social Security.	0
Governor Kasich, do you want 30 seconds?	0
I wanna tell you, in my state, we took Medicaid, the hardest program to control, and we took it from a 10 percent growth rate to 2.5 percent without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one single benefit.	0
And so much of what we did — to force competition, to use technology, to stand down the special interest groups — can you imagine taking Medicaid from 10 to 2.5 percent?	0
We can take many of those same procedures, we can apply it to Medicare.	0
We can make a stronger program.	0
But I agree with Jeb, you can't just do this by growing the economy.	0
You can't grow your way out of demographics.	0
But we can give people better health care.	0
And finally, on health care, why don't we start treating — keep giving...	0
Governor.	0
...incentives for people to keep people healthy, rather than giving the incentives to treat them when they're sick?	0
Governor, thank you.	0
Senator Paul, let's go back to you.	0
Do these solutions sound like they work?	0
Say again?	0
Do these solutions sound like they would work?	0
You can't do nothing.	0
"And that's what I hear from some people, we'll do nothing and it will just be fixed."""	0
"That's absurd, and I think people who don't want to fix it, really, or unwilling to take the chance to say, ""something has to change,"" are missing the boat here."	0
The age will have to gradually rise, there is no question.	0
It's the only way you fix Medicare, the only way you fix Social Security.	0
You will also have to means-test the benefits and declare there's not enough money.	0
"It isn't ""I put money in, I'm getting it back."""	0
There is no money, it's a stack of paper.	0
There is no money in the Social Security account.	0
There is no money in the Medicare account.	0
There's only a promise to pay by the next generation, and the next generation's not big enough to pay it.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
...to deal with this. We did it 200 days ago.	0
Hold on, Governor.	0
I've got a question for — for Dr. Carson.	0
About Medicare?	0
Yes.	0
You've said that you would like to replace Medicare with a system of individual family savings accounts, so that families could cover their own expenses.	0
Obviously, that would be a very controversial idea.	0
Explain how that would work, exactly.	0
Well, first of all the — the plan gives people the option of — of opting out.	0
But I think they will see a very good option here.	0
You know, the annual Medicare budget is over $600 billion.	0
And there are 48 million people involved — 40 million, 65 and over, and 8 million other.	0
Divide that out.	0
That comes out to $12,500 for each one.	0
Now, I can tell you there are a lot of private-sector things that you could do with $12,500, which will get you a lot more than you get from this government program.	0
And that's really a theme of a lot of the things that I'm talking about.	0
"How do we utilize our intellect rather than allowing the government to use its, quote, ""intellect,"" in order to help us to be able to live healthier and better lives?"	0
It was never intended that the government should be in every aspect of our lives.	0
This is a country that is of, for and by the people.	0
Thank you, Dr. Carson.	0
Governor?	0
And — and — and I — you know, Ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to Washington, D.C. to fix this problem.	0
And that's what you'll hear from Hillary Clinton — and I've already heard from her — is that, send more money in Social Security, send more money in Medicare taxes, send more money for Medicaid, and that's gonna solve the problem.	0
What we know is we're living longer.	0
That's a blessing.	0
It's a blessing that we're living longer, so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing.	0
We need to make sure that people understand, as Jeb said before, that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country, do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later?	0
Or would you rather take less later on?	0
Senator Rubio...	0
Governor, do you also think that...	0
...yeah, I just wanted	0
[ inaudible ]	0
.	0
...that Dr. Carson's right, that we can replace Medicare with individual savings accounts?	0
No.	0
No.	0
What I said was that I think that Dr. Carson's ideas are good ideas.	0
They're not my ideas, and I don't necessarily agree with all of them.	0
But this is what you're seeing in the Republican debate that you didn't see in that Democrat debate.	0
You didn't see it for a minute.	0
You didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around, and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there.	0
"What you saw was a parade of, ""I'll give you this for free; I'll give you that for free."""	0
Let me tell you, everybody, when they say they want to give it to you for free, keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it.	0
And that's why I think these ideas up here are great, and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha.	0
[ crosstalk ]	0
I want to give you 30 seconds here.	0
I want to take off from that point and argue the same thing.	0
And that is that one of the things you're watching tonight are 11 quality candidates debating an important issue.	0
The Republican Party is blessed to have 11 good candidates,	0
[ inaudible ]	0
10 good candidates.	0
The Democrats can't even come up with one.	0
And on this issue of the Medicare in particular, it's important because they're going to demagogue what we're saying here tonight.	0
Everyone up here tonight that's talking about reforms, I think and I know for myself I speak to this, we're all talking about reforms for future generations.	0
Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries.	0
My mother is on Medicare and Social Security.	0
I'm against anything that's bad for my mother.	0
[ laughter ]	0
So, we're talking about — we're talking about reform for people like me and people like Senator Cruz, as he talked about earlier, who are years away from retirement that have a way to plan for these changes, and way that's very reasonable.	0
And it's not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us.	0
John, I — if I — a lot of people have jumped in here.	0
I'd like to jump in.	0
A lot of people have jumped in here.	0
Mrs. Fiorina, we're right at the end of our time.	0
I understand.	0
You all wanted us to limit	0
[ inaudible ]	0
All right.	0
Go ahead.	0
I would just say that...	0
[ laughter ]	0
... I would just say this, we've heard a lot of great ideas up here, and I agree with what Senator Rubio said.	0
Every election we talk about this.	0
Every election we talk about Medicare and Social Security reform.	0
It never happens.	0
I would like to start with a basic.	0
Let us actually go to zero- based budgeting so we know where the money is being spent.	0
It's kind of basic.	0
There is a bill sitting in the House that would actually pass and have us go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dime of your money is being spent instead of only talking about how much more we're going to spend year after year after year.	0
My point is this.	0
While there are lots of good ideas for reform, we have never tackled the basics.	0
And we finally need to tackle the basics to cut this government down to size and hold it accountable.	0
So let's start by knowing where your money is being spent by the federal government.	0
We have now reached the point in the program where candidates are going to give their closing statements, 30 seconds apiece.	0
We're going to go right to left and start with you, Senator Paul.	0
Liberty thrives when government is small.	0
I want a government so small I can barely see it.	0
I want a government so small that the individual has a chance to thrive and prosper.	0
I think, though, government is too big now.	0
And what you're going to see in Washington this week is establishment Republicans have made an agreement with the president to raise the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion; no limit to the debt ceiling raise.	0
This is extraordinary.	0
It's extraordinarily wrong.	0
You'll see me on the floor of the Senate tomorrow filibustering this and saying enough is enough, no more debt.	0
Governor Christie?	0
I want to talk to the folks at home.	0
I want to ask you: Are you fed up with how Washington taxes you?	0
Are you fed up with how Washington wastes your money?	0
Are you concerned like I am that the debt and deficits of Washington, D.C. are endangering America's future?	0
I've got one more question for you then.	0
Are you serious about this election?	0
Because if you are, you need to elect someone who's deadly serious about changing this culture.	0
I am deadly serious about changing this culture.	0
I changed it in New Jersey.	0
I'm deadly serious about doing this job the right way.	0
I'm prepared.	0
I'm tested.	0
I'm ready.	0
And I want to make this our government.	0
For the people who say we can't do it, I say hell no, we can do it together.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Senator Cruz?	0
You know, everyone here talks about the need to take on Washington.	0
The natural next question is who actually has done so.	0
Who actually has stood up not just to Democrats, but to leaders in our own party?	0
When millions of Americans rose up against Obamacare, I was proud to lead that fight.	0
When millions of Americans rose up against amnesty, I was proud to lead that fight.	0
When millions of Americans rose up against Planned Parenthood, I was proud to lead that fight.	0
If people are promising they're going to take on Washington and cronyism, you need to look to who has been doing it.	0
In my family, my dad fled oppression in Cuba to come to America.	0
Freedom is personal for me, and I will always keep my word and fight for freedom.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Mrs. Fiorina?	0
You know, every election we hear a lot of talk.	0
We hear a lot of good plans.	0
We hear actually a lot of good intentions.	0
But somehow for decades, nothing really has changed.	0
What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results.	0
That's how you go from secretary to CEO.	0
You lead and you produce results.	0
I will cut this government down to size and hold it accountable, simplify the tax code, roll back the regulations that have been spewing out of Washington, D.C. for 50 years.	0
I may not be your dream candidate just yet, but I can assure you I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.	0
And in your heart of hearts, you cannot wait to see a debate between Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina.	0
I will tell you this, I will beat Hillary Clinton.	0
And with your vote and your support and your prayers, I will lead with the citizens of this great nation the resurgence of this great nation.	0
Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.	0
Dr. Carson?	0
I just want to thank all my colleagues here for being civil, and not falling for the traps.	0
And, I also just want to thank the audience for being attentive, and noticing the questions, and the noticing the answers.	0
And, this is what I am finding throughout America.	0
People are waking up because it is going to be us who will determine the direction of our country.	0
And, it was made for we the people, we are the ones who decide who we are, and we should never give away the values and principles that made America into a great nation for the sake of political correctness.	0
[ applause ]	0
Mr. Trump?	0
Our country doesn't win anymore.	0
We used to win, we don't win anymore.	0
We lose on trade.	0
We lose with ISIS.	0
We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.	0
We don't win.	0
Let me give you one quick example.	0
These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.	0
I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.	0
I went out and said, it's ridiculous.	0
Nobody — I could stand up here all night.	0
Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.	0
It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.	0
We called Ben, he was with me 100%.	0
We called in, we said, that's it.	0
We're not doing it.	0
They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.	0
Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.	0
Not bad.	0
[ applause ]	0
And, I'll do that with the country.	0
We will make America great again.	0
And, thank you everybody.	0
Just for the record.	0
Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours.	0
Senator Rubio?	0
That's not right.	0
That is absolutely not right.	0
You know that.	0
That is not right.	0
[ ]	0
Thank you.	0
Senator Rubio.	0
You know, America doesn't owe me anything.	0
I have a debt to America I'll never repay.	0
This isn't just the country I was born in, this is the nation that literally changed the history of my family.	0
My parents in this country were able to give me the chance to do all the things they never did.	0
We call that the American Dream, although, it's built on the universal dream of a better life.	0
The fact that it's happened for so many people here throughout our history, that's what makes us special.	0
But, now for millions of Americans, it's slipping away.	0
And, we have a government and leaders in government that are completely out of touch, and that's why I'm running for president.	0
Because we can't just save the American Dream, we can expand it to reach more people, and change more lives than ever before.	0
And, that's why tonight I'm asking you for your vote.	0
Thank you, Senator.	0
Governor Bush?	0
America's at a crossroads.	0
The D.C. politicians continue to make things worse.	0
I have a proven record of success, 32 years in business, and 8 years as Governor of the state of Florida.	0
I will change the culture in Washington, just as I changed the culture in Tallahassee.	0
I will do so in a way that will bring people together.	0
We need a unifier, not a cynical divider in chief, and that's exactly what I will do.	0
Imagine a country where people are lifted out of poverty again.	0
Imagine a country where the middle class can get rising income again.	0
I know we can do this because we're still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
Governor Huckabee.	0
You know, I know to a lot of people in the media, this is just a great big game, and we're the players.	0
And, we come out here, and we do our thing.	0
And, sometimes we're held up in contempt by people who write columns, but, I guarantee you to every person on this stage there's something deep inside of us that would cause us to give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people of America.	0
I've got five grandkids.	0
"I do not want to walk my five grandkids through the charred remains of a once great country called America, and say, ""Here you go, $20 trillion dollars of debt."	0
"Good luck making something out of this mess."""	0
And, for those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard why we're here, and hopefully you'll know we're not here for ourselves.	0
We honest to god are here to get this country back on track.	0
I know this, I certainly am.	0
Thank you...	0
...Thank you.	0
Governor Kasich?	0
"I was on morning Joe at a town hall and a young student stood up and said, ""Can I still be idealistic?"""	0
I said, absolutely, you can still change the world.	0
And, you know the old inscription, if you save one life, you've changed the world.	0
Folks, we have a problem here with the leadership in Washington, but I'll tell you another problem.	0
We need to rebuild our families.	0
We need to have stronger families.	0
We need to know who our neighbors are.	0
We need to come together as a country because we have to realize that America is great, not from the top-down.	0
Oh yeah, we want to elect a good president, but America is great from the bottom-up, and the bottom-up is us in our families, in our communities, in our neighborhoods.	0
We will renew America if we work together, and I am totally confident that we will.	0
And God bless America.	0
[ applause ]	0
Thank you, Governor.	0
That concludes tonight's debate.	0
On behalf of my colleagues Becky Quick, John Harwood, Sharon Epperson, Rick Santelli and Jim Cramer, we'd like to our host, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Republican National Committee, the candidates and, of course, tonight's audience.	0
Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.	0
"I'm Lester Holt, anchor of ""NBC Nightly News."""	0
I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.	0
The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.	0
This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization.	0
The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.	0
The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long.	0
We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.	0
At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.	0
From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.	0
The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.	0
The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.	0
I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
How are you, Donald?	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Good luck to you.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.	0
We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.	0
I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.	0
Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.	0
So, let's begin.	0
"We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity."""	0
And central to that is jobs.	0
There are two economic realities in America today.	0
There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.	0
However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.	0
Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?	0
Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.	0
The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	0
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.	0
First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	0
That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	0
I want us to invest in you.	0
I want us to invest in your future.	0
That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	0
We also have to make the economy fairer.	0
That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	0
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.	0
If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.	0
And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	0
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.	0
So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.	0
Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	0
How are we going to do it?	0
We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.	0
Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	0
We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.	0
You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	0
I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	0
Secretary Clinton, thank you.	0
Mr. Trump, the same question to you.	0
It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.	0
You have up to two minutes.	0
Thank you, Lester.	0
Our jobs are fleeing the country.	0
They're going to Mexico.	0
They're going to many other countries.	0
You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.	0
They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	0
And we have a very good fight.	0
And we have a winning fight.	0
Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.	1
So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.	0
When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.	0
They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.	0
With the United States, as he said, not so much.	0
So Ford is leaving.	0
You see that, their small car division leaving.	0
Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.	0
They're all leaving.	0
And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	0
As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.	0
We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	0
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	0
We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.	0
All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	0
They left -- fired 1,400 people.	0
They're going to Mexico.	0
So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	0
We cannot let it happen.	0
Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.	0
That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	0
It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.	0
Companies will come.	0
They will build.	0
They will expand.	0
New companies will start.	0
And I look very, very much forward to doing it.	0
We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.	0
Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?	0
Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	0
Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	0
And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.	0
We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.	0
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.	0
In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	1
I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.	0
That is not how we grow the economy.	0
We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	0
I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.	0
I understand that.	0
You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	0
He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	0
I don't buy that.	0
I have a different experience.	0
My father was a small-businessman.	0
He worked really hard.	0
He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.	0
And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.	0
That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.	0
Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.	0
You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.	0
How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?	0
How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?	0
Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0
Our country's in deep trouble.	0
We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	0
They're the best, the best ever at it.	0
What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	0
So we have to do that.	0
We have to renegotiate our trade deals.	0
And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.	0
Let me give you the example of Mexico.	0
They have a VAT tax.	0
We're on a different system.	0
When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.	0
When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	0
When they sell into us, there's no tax.	0
It's a defective agreement.	0
It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.	0
Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	0
Good.	0
I want you to be very happy.	0
It's very important to me.	0
But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.	0
She's been doing this for 30 years.	0
And why hasn't she made the agreements better?	0
The NAFTA agreement is defective.	0
Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...	0
Let me interrupt just a moment, but...	0
Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	0
They should have been doing this for years.	0
What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	0
We cannot do it any longer, Lester.	0
Back to the question, though.	0
How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	0
How do you make them bring the jobs back?	0
Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.	0
The companies are leaving.	0
I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	0
They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	0
And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	0
We wish you a lot of luck.	0
But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.	0
And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.	0
So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.	0
We have to stop them from leaving.	0
And that's a big, big factor.	0
Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.	0
Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	0
We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	0
That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	0
In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	1
"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."""	1
Well, it did collapse.	0
That's called business, by the way.	0
Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	0
Five million people lost their homes.	0
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	0
Now, we have come back from that abyss.	0
And it has not been easy.	0
So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.	0
Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	1
They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.	0
Take clean energy.	0
Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.	0
Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	1
I think it's real.	0
I did not.	0
I did not.	0
I do not say that.	1
I think science is real.	0
I do not say that.	0
And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.	0
And here's what we can do.	0
We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.	0
We can have enough clean energy to power every home.	0
We can build a new modern electric grid.	0
That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.	0
So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
She talks about solar panels.	0
We invested in a solar company, our country.	0
That was a disaster.	0
They lost plenty of money on that one.	0
Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.	0
Our energy policies are a disaster.	0
Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.	0
You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	0
The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.	1
He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	1
So I will tell you this.	0
We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	0
And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.	0
And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	0
And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	0
You've been doing this for 30 years.	0
Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?	0
For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	0
Well, actually...	0
I will bring -- excuse me.	0
I will bring back jobs.	0
You can't bring back jobs.	0
Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	0
Yeah, for 30 years.	0
And I have -- well, not quite that long.	0
I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.	0
I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...	0
Well, he approved NAFTA...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
million new jobs, a balanced budget...	0
He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.	0
Incomes went up for everybody.	0
Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.	0
When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	0
Will they create jobs in America?	0
Will they raise incomes in America?	0
And are they good for our national security?	0
Some of them I voted for.	0
The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	1
And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	0
But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	0
I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.	0
I'm going to have a special prosecutor.	0
We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	0
When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	0
We increased them to China 50 percent.	0
So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.	0
Very quickly...	0
But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	0
Well, I've been a senator, Donald...	0
You haven't done it.	0
You haven't done it.	0
And I have been a secretary of state...	0
Excuse me.	0
And I have done a lot...	0
Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	0
Well, that's your opinion.	0
That is your opinion.	0
You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	1
NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.	0
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
You were totally in favor of it.	0
Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	0
But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.	0
Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	0
Well, that is just not accurate.	0
I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.	0
I wrote about that in...	0
You called it the gold standard.	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
You called it the gold standard of trade deals.	1
You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.	1
No.	0
And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.	0
Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.	0
The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...	0
Not.	0
which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.	0
I wrote about that in my book...	0
So is it President Obama's fault?	0
before you even announced.	0
Is it President Obama's fault?	0
Look, there are differences...	0
Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?	0
There are...	0
Because he's pushing it.	0
There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	0
And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.	0
That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.	0
But you have no plan.	0
But in -- oh, but I do.	0
Secretary, you have no plan.	0
In fact, I have written a book about it.	0
"It's called ""Stronger Together."""	0
You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...	0
That's about all you've...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Folks, we're going to...	0
or at an airport near you.	0
We're going to move to...	0
But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.	0
We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	0
So we have a very robust set of plans.	0
And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	0
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.	0
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.	0
You are going to drive business out.	0
Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	0
And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	0
I'm very proud of it.	0
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	0
But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	0
When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	0
And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.	0
You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.	0
And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.	0
I'm going to cut regulations.	0
I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	0
Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment.	0
We're going to talk taxes...	0
That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	0
Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.	0
I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...	0
Facts.	0
So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	0
So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	0
Because what I have proposed...	0
And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.	0
would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	0
What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.	0
What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.	0
And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.	0
Well, you just opened the next segment.	0
Well, could I just finish -- I think I...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
I'm going to give you a chance right here...	0
I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	0
with a new 15-minute segment...	0
She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.	0
Mr. Trump, I'm going to...	0
And look at her website.	0
You know what?	0
It's no difference than this.	0
She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	0
Just go to her website.	0
She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.	0
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	0
The next segment, we're continuing...	0
Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.	0
achieving prosperity...	0
No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
No, we're not.	0
No, we're not.	0
See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.	0
That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.	0
OK, you are unpacking a lot here.	0
And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.	0
And I want to talk about taxes.	0
The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.	0
Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.	0
I'd like you to further defend that.	0
And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.	0
I'd like you to defend that.	0
And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.	0
Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	0
They're going to expand their companies.	0
They're going to do a tremendous job.	0
I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.	0
And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	0
It's a great thing for the middle class.	0
It's a great thing for companies to expand.	0
And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.	0
So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.	0
And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	0
Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	0
Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	0
And here's the thing.	0
Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	0
I happen to think it's double that.	0
It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.	0
And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.	0
But we have no leadership.	0
And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	0
All right.	0
You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.	0
I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.	0
Why not?	0
Why not?	0
Yeah, why not?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	0
Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...	0
There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.	0
This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.	0
Yes.	0
Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	0
We've looked at your tax proposals.	0
I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.	0
I happen to support that.	0
Then you didn't read it.	0
I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.	0
But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.	0
You've proposed an approach that has a...	0
Who gave it that name?	0
The first I've -- who gave it that name?	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.	0
$4 billion tax benefit for your family.	0
And when you look at what you are proposing...	0
How much?	0
How much for my family?	0
it is...	0
Lester, how much?	0
as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	0
Trickle-down did not work.	0
It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.	0
Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	0
And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.	0
And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.	0
I don't think top-down works in America.	0
I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	0
Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	0
Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	0
Mr. Trump, we're...	0
Typical politician.	0
All talk, no action.	0
Sounds good, doesn't work.	0
Never going to happen.	0
Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.	0
Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.	1
And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	0
And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	0
We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	0
And we better be awfully careful.	0
And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	0
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.	0
The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	0
And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	0
The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.	0
Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.	0
And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.	0
Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?	0
I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.	0
And it'll be released.	0
And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	0
But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	1
It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	0
If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.	0
But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0
When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	0
You know what that is?	0
That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	0
We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	0
The IRS says an audit...	0
Excuse me.	0
of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.	0
And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...	0
Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.	0
Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.	0
I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.	0
I said, do you get audited?	0
I get audited almost every year.	0
And in a way, I should be complaining.	0
I'm not even complaining.	0
I don't mind it.	0
It's almost become a way of life.	0
I get audited by the IRS.	0
But other people don't.	0
I will say this.	0
We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	0
I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.	0
As soon as she releases them, I will release.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
I will release my tax returns.	0
"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."""	0
I will tell you this.	0
No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.	0
Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.	0
When the audit's complete, I'll do it.	0
But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.	0
So it's negotiable?	0
It's not negotiable, no.	0
Let her release the e-mails.	0
Why did she delete 33,000...	0
Well, I'll let her answer that.	0
But let me just admonish the audience one more time.	0
There was an agreement.	0
We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	0
For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	0
You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	0
We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	0
So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	0
And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	0
First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	0
Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	0
Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	0
Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	1
That makes me smart.	0
So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	0
And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	0
And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	0
They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	0
And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.	0
And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	0
And we'll guess.	0
We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	0
But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	0
Who does he owe money to?	0
Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.	0
He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.	0
Do you want to respond to that?	0
I do.	0
You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	0
That's for sure.	0
And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	0
But I'm not going to make any excuses.	0
It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	0
Mr. Trump?	0
That was more than a mistake.	0
That was done purposely.	0
OK?	0
That was not a mistake.	0
That was done purposely.	0
When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.	0
And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.	0
As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.	0
That I can tell you.	0
You learn a lot from financial disclosure.	0
And you should go down and take a look at that.	0
The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.	0
The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	0
It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	0
The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	0
And the $650 isn't even on that.	0
But it's not $650.	0
It's much less than that.	0
But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.	0
These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.	0
I could do that very quickly.	0
I am very underleveraged.	0
I have a great company.	0
I have a tremendous income.	0
And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	0
It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	0
When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.	0
Our airports are like from a third world country.	0
You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.	0
So the worst of all things has happened.	0
We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	0
We haven't even started.	0
And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.	0
Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.	0
And it's really a shame.	0
And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.	0
Our country has tremendous problems.	0
We're a debtor nation.	0
We're a serious debtor nation.	0
And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.	0
And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.	0
We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.	0
And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
And the other thing I think is important...	0
It would be squandered, too, believe me.	0
is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.	0
You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.	0
And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	0
I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.	0
We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	0
It's a beautiful facility.	0
It immediately was put to use.	0
And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...	0
Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...	0
Well, to...	0
Which our country should do, too.	0
Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?	0
I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	0
He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	0
And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	1
There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.	0
You call yourself the King of Debt.	0
You talk about leverage.	0
You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.	1
Wrong.	0
Wrong.	0
Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	0
Let's let Mr. Trump...	0
And we need to be very clear about that.	0
So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.	0
Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	0
I built an unbelievable company.	0
Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.	0
It's an unbelievable company.	0
But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.	0
And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.	0
Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.	0
But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.	0
My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	0
And that's what I do.	0
But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.	0
I'll give you an example.	0
We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	0
But we're opening the Old Post Office.	0
Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.	0
I'm a year ahead of schedule.	0
And that's what this country should be doing.	0
We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.	0
We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.	0
When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.	0
The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	0
And we should be able to do that for our country.	0
Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.	0
We move into our next segment talking about America's direction.	0
And let's start by talking about race.	0
The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.	0
Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.	0
So how do you heal the divide?	0
Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.	0
Well, you're right.	0
Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	0
Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	0
We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.	0
And we've got to do several things at the same time.	0
We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	0
We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	0
Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	0
Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	0
So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	0
I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.	0
But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	0
So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	0
And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	0
The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	1
So we have to do two things, as I said.	0
We have to restore trust.	0
We have to work with the police.	0
We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	0
And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.	0
All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.	0
How do you heal the divide?	0
Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.	0
And we need law and order.	0
If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.	0
And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	0
I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.	0
We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.	0
We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.	0
You walk down the street, you get shot.	0
In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.	1
Thousands of shootings.	0
And I'm saying, where is this?	0
Is this a war-torn country?	0
What are we doing?	0
And we have to stop the violence.	0
We have to bring back law and order.	0
In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.	0
We have to bring back law and order.	0
Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	0
It brought the crime rate way down.	0
But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.	0
We have gangs roaming the street.	0
And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	0
And they have guns.	0
And they shoot people.	0
And we have to be very strong.	0
And we have to be very vigilant.	0
We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	0
Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.	0
We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.	0
Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.	0
Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.	0
No, you're wrong.	0
It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	0
It was taken away from her.	0
And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	0
They would have won an appeal.	0
If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.	0
The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.	0
No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	0
These are felons.	0
These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.	0
You need more police.	0
You need a better community, you know, relation.	0
You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	0
It's terrible.	0
I have property there.	0
It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.	0
But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.	0
You need better relationships.	0
I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.	0
You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	0
But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.	0
So there's some bad things going on.	0
Some really bad things.	0
Secretary Clinton...	0
But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.	0
And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.	0
And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.	0
Ugh.	0
You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.	0
There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.	0
But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	0
There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	0
Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.	0
It did not do what it needed to do.	0
Now, I believe in community policing.	0
And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.	0
Property crime is down 40 percent.	0
We just don't want to see it creep back up.	0
We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.	0
But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.	0
Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	0
And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.	1
So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	0
We cannot just say law and order.	0
We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.	0
We need to have more second chance programs.	0
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.	0
You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.	0
So there are some positive ways we can work on this.	0
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	0
Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	0
In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	0
We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	0
And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.	0
If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	0
Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.	0
Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?	0
Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	0
I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	0
And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	0
But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.	0
I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	0
They admit it's an issue.	0
They've got a lot of concerns.	0
Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.	0
They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.	0
And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
I'd like to respond to that.	0
Please.	0
First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.	0
I agree with you.	0
When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	0
These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.	0
But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	0
And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	0
But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.	0
I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.	1
And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.	0
I think you've apologized for it.	0
But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	0
And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.	0
Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.	0
And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	0
I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	0
Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	0
It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	0
But we went from 2,200 to 500.	0
And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.	0
And it was terminated by current mayor.	0
But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	0
Tremendous beyond belief.	0
So when you say it has no impact, it really did.	0
It had a very, very big impact.	0
Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	0
So there is...	0
No, you're wrong.	0
You're wrong.	0
No, I'm not.	0
Murders are up.	0
All right.	0
You check it.	0
New York -- New York has done an excellent job.	0
And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.	0
And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	0
Look, one murder is too many.	0
But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	0
And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.	0
Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	0
But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	0
And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	0
This conversation is about race.	0
And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...	0
I'd like to just respond, if I might.	0
Please -- 20 seconds.	0
I'd just like to respond.	0
Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.	0
I will.	0
Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.	0
They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.	0
The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.	0
They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.	0
They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.	0
Mr. Trump, let me...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Well, I -- I do think...	0
And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	0
You decided to stay home, and that's OK.	0
But I will tell you, I've been all over.	0
And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	0
And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.	0
Mr. Trump, I...	0
I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.	0
And, yes, I did.	0
And you know what else I prepared for?	0
I prepared to be president.	0
And I think that's a good thing.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.	0
You questioned his legitimacy.	0
In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States.	0
Can you tell us what took you so long?	0
I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	0
Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.	0
And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.	0
And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	0
And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.	0
Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	0
They were pressing it very hard.	1
She failed to get the birth certificate.	0
When I got involved, I didn't fail.	0
I got him to give the birth certificate.	0
So I'm satisfied with it.	0
And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.	0
That was...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	0
I will let you respond.	0
It's important.	0
But I just want to get the answer here.	0
The birth certificate was produced in 2011.	0
You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...	0
Yeah.	0
as recently as January.	0
So the question is, what changed your mind?	0
Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.	0
I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.	0
But nobody was caring much about it.	0
But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.	0
And I think I did a good job.	0
Secretary Clinton also fought it.	0
I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	0
Look, it's true.	0
Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.	0
And she was involved.	0
But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	0
I'm sorry.	0
I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.	0
But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.	0
What do you say to Americans, people of color who...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	0
I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.	0
He should have produced it a long time before.	0
I say nothing.	0
But let me just tell you.	0
When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	0
I think you can see that.	0
And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	0
And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, just listen to what you heard.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	0
But it can't be dismissed that easily.	0
He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	0
There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	0
But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	1
He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.	0
So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	0
And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	0
You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.	0
And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	0
But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.	0
And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.	0
Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.	0
I would love to respond.	0
First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.	0
You treated him with terrible disrespect.	0
And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	0
It doesn't work that way.	0
You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	0
I don't think you can deny that.	0
But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	0
So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.	0
It really doesn't.	0
Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.	0
We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.	0
It was very easy to do.	0
I notice you bring that up a lot.	0
And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	0
Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	0
But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	0
Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	0
I'll go one step further.	0
In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	0
No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.	0
And it's a tremendously successful club.	0
And I'm so glad I did it.	0
And I have been given great credit for what I did.	0
And I'm very, very proud of it.	0
And that's the way I feel.	0
That is the true way I feel.	0
"Our next segment is called ""Securing America."""	0
We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.	0
Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.	0
So my question is, who's behind it?	0
And how do we fight it?	0
Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.	0
Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.	0
There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.	0
But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	0
The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.	0
There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.	0
I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...	0
(CROSSTALK)	0
tough, long game here.	0
And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	0
And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	0
We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.	0
And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.	0
And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.	0
We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.	0
But we will defend the citizens of this country.	0
And the Russians need to understand that.	0
I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.	0
And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.	1
That is just unacceptable.	0
It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...	0
Your two minutes have expired.	0
have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.	0
It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.	0
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question.	0
Who's behind it?	0
And how do we fight it?	0
I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.	0
That just happened, and many more are coming.	0
And I'm very proud of it.	0
In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	0
They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	0
I was just endorsed by ICE.	0
I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.	0
So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.	0
OK?	0
Because look at the mess that we're in.	0
Look at the mess that we're in.	0
As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.	0
We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.	0
I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	0
She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.	0
I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.	0
It could also be lots of other people.	0
It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?	0
You don't know who broke in to DNC.	0
But what did we learn with DNC?	0
We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.	0
Look what happened to her.	0
But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.	0
That's what we learned.	0
Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.	0
We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.	0
ISIS.	0
So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.	0
It is -- it is a huge problem.	0
I have a son.	0
He's 10 years old.	0
He has computers.	0
He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	0
The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.	0
And maybe it's hardly doable.	0
But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.	0
But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.	0
We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	0
I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.	0
It does involve going after them online.	0
I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.	0
But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.	0
We're making progress.	0
Our military is assisting in Iraq.	0
And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	0
But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	0
And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.	0
I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	0
And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.	0
Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	0
You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.	0
I'll ask this to both of you.	0
Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?	0
Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	0
Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.	0
We will take out ISIS.	0
Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.	0
And ISIS was formed.	0
So she talks about taking them out.	0
She's been doing it a long time.	0
She's been trying to take them out for a long time.	0
But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	0
And then you wouldn't have had them.	0
Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.	0
And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	0
Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	0
Wrong.	0
That is absolutely proved over and over again.	0
Wrong.	0
Wrong.	0
He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	1
But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.	0
And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	0
But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.	0
The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	0
That's the most important part of this.	0
How do we prevent attacks?	0
How do we protect our people?	0
And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.	0
I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	0
You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.	0
And they brought him down.	0
And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	0
So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.	0
That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	0
We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	0
We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	0
Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.	0
They're on the front lines.	0
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	0
They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
Well, I have to respond.	0
Please respond.	0
The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.	0
You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.	0
Under your direction, to a large extent.	0
But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.	0
They were choking on the sanctions.	0
And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.	0
But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?	0
And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	0
I did really well.	0
But I have common sense.	0
And I said, well, I'll tell you.	0
I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.	0
But two things.	0
Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	0
Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	0
And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.	0
And I was very strong.	0
And I said it numerous times.	0
And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	0
And I think that's great.	0
And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	0
It's a lot of money to protect other people.	0
But I'm all for NATO.	0
But I said they have to focus on terror, also.	1
And they're going to do that.	1
And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	1
I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	0
And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.	0
Not only that, you named the day.	0
They couldn't believe it.	0
They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.	0
They said...	0
Lester, we've covered...	0
No, wait a minute.	0
We've covered this ground.	0
When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.	0
It should have never happened.	0
Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	0
But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.	0
Now it's in over 30 countries.	0
And you're going to stop them?	0
I don't think so.	0
Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.	0
You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.	0
What makes your...	0
I did not support the war in Iraq.	1
In 2002...	0
That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.	0
My question is, since you supported it...	0
Just -- would you like to hear...	0
why is your -- why is your judgment...	0
Wait a minute.	0
I was against the war in Iraq.	0
Just so you put it out.	0
The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...	0
The record does not show that.	0
Why was -- is your judgment any...	0
The record shows that I'm right.	0
When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	0
Essentially.	0
I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.	0
We talked about the economy is more important.	0
I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.	0
I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.	0
And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	0
Why is your judgment better than...	0
And when he -- excuse me.	0
And that was before the war started.	0
Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.	0
I was against the war.	0
He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.	0
And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.	0
But nobody called Sean Hannity.	0
And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.	0
I think in '04.	0
But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.	0
And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.	0
But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.	0
He and I used to have arguments about the war.	0
I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	0
It's going to destabilize the Middle East.	0
And that's exactly what it's done.	0
It's been a disaster.	0
My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...	0
No, no.	0
You didn't hear what I said.	0
Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?	0
Well, I have much better judgment than she does.	0
There's no question about that.	0
I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.	0
I have a winning temperament.	0
I know how to win.	0
She does not have a...	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Wait.	0
The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	0
I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Whew, OK.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	0
You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.	0
And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?	0
After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	0
With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	0
They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	0
They had built covert facilities.	0
They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.	0
And we had sanctioned them.	0
I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	0
So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.	0
And we did drive them to the negotiating table.	0
And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
That's diplomacy.	0
That's coalition-building.	0
That's working with other nations.	0
The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	0
He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.	0
That's not good judgment.	0
That would not start a war.	0
That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	0
And the worst part...	0
No, they were taunting us.	0
of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.	0
He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	0
It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	0
He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	0
Wrong.	0
have a good time, folks.	0
It's lies.	0
And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.	0
That is the number-one threat we face in the world.	0
And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.	0
So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.	0
That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.	0
I would like to...	0
It's a good one, though.	0
It well describes the problem.	0
(LAUGHTER)	0
It's not an accurate one at all.	0
It's not an accurate one.	0
So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.	0
I agree with her on one thing.	0
The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	0
Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0
Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.	1
They do not pay us.	1
But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.	0
That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.	0
I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	0
All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.	0
We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...	0
We need to move on.	0
Well, wait, but it's very important.	0
All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.	0
We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	0
They have to help us out.	0
Our last...	0
As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	0
It is the single greatest threat that this country has.	0
Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.	0
On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.	0
Do you support the current policy?	0
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.	0
Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.	0
But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.	0
We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	0
I looked the other night.	0
I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.	0
We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	0
I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	0
But I would certainly not do first strike.	0
I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	0
At the same time, we have to be prepared.	0
I can't take anything off the table.	0
Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.	0
China should solve that problem for us.	0
China should go into North Korea.	0
China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.	1
And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.	0
Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.	0
Iran has power over North Korea.	0
And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.	0
And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.	0
And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?	0
Why didn't you add other things into the deal?	0
One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.	1
Nobody's ever seen that before.	0
That turned out to be wrong.	0
It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.	0
It certainly looks that way.	0
So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?	0
This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	0
The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.	0
All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	0
Your two minutes is expired.	0
And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	0
I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.	0
Believe me, he's not a happy camper.	0
All right.	0
Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.	0
Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.	0
Words matter when you run for president.	0
And they really matter when you are president.	0
And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.	0
It is essential that America's word be good.	0
And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.	0
I've talked with a number of them.	0
But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.	0
It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	0
There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.	0
But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.	0
And Donald never tells you what he would do.	0
Would he have started a war?	0
Would he have bombed Iran?	0
If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.	0
But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.	0
He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.	0
So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	0
People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.	0
Can they rely on us?	0
Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?	0
That's what I intend to do.	0
I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	0
We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	0
Your two minutes is...	0
to be given any opportunities at all.	0
is expired.	0
Lester, one thing I'd like to say.	0
Very quickly.	0
Twenty seconds.	0
I will go very quickly.	0
But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.	0
Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	0
Mr. Trump...	0
And it's a big problem.	0
And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.	0
We cannot be the policemen of the world.	0
We cannot protect countries all over the world...	0
We have just...	0
where they're not paying us what we need.	0
We have just a few final questions...	0
And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	0
We need heart.	0
We need a lot of things.	0
But you have to have some basic ability.	0
And sadly, she doesn't have that.	0
All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.	0
But they weren't taken care of.	0
And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.	0
Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.	0
"Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look."""	0
She's standing here right now.	0
What did you mean by that?	0
She doesn't have the look.	0
She doesn't have the stamina.	0
I said she doesn't have the stamina.	0
And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	0
To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.	0
"The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look."""	0
You have -- wait a minute.	0
Wait a minute, Lester.	0
You asked me a question.	0
Did you ask me a question?	0
You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	0
You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.	0
I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?	0
And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?	0
All you have to do is speak to them.	0
Wait.	0
You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.	0
Let's let her respond.	0
Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
The world -- let me tell you.	0
Let me tell you.	0
Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.	0
We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
But it's bad, bad experience.	0
Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	0
I agree.	0
She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	0
And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	0
We are at -- we are at the final question.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Well, one thing.	0
One thing, Lester.	0
Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.	0
You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.	0
But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...	1
I never said that.	0
women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	0
I didn't say that.	0
And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.	0
He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.	0
"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."""	0
"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."	0
Donald, she has a name.	0
Where did you find this?	0
Where did you find this?	0
Her name is Alicia Machado.	0
Where did you find this?	0
And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	0
Oh, really?	0
she's going to vote this November.	0
OK, good.	0
Let me just tell you...	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...	0
You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	0
Some of it's said in entertainment.	0
Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	0
But you want to know the truth?	0
I was going to say something...	0
Please very quickly.	0
"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it."	0
I just can't do it.	0
It's inappropriate.	0
"It's not nice."""	0
But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.	0
They're untrue.	0
And they're misrepresentations.	0
And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	0
And I don't deserve that.	0
But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	0
It's hundreds of millions of ads.	0
And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...	0
We have to move on to the final question.	0
$200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
One of you will not win this election.	0
So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?	0
Secretary Clinton?	0
Well, I support our democracy.	0
And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	0
But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.	0
And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.	0
It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.	0
So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	0
Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question.	0
Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?	0
I want to make America great again.	0
We are a nation that is seriously troubled.	0
We're losing our jobs.	0
People are pouring into our country.	0
The other day, we were deporting 800 people.	0
And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.	0
Ended up becoming citizens.	0
And it was 800.	0
And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.	0
Will you accept the outcome of the election?	0
Look, here's the story.	0
I want to make America great again.	0
I'm going to be able to do it.	0
I don't believe Hillary will.	0
The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.	0
(APPLAUSE)	0
All right.	0
Well, that is going to do it for us.	0
That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one.	0
We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.	0
The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.	0
The conversation will continue.	0
A reminder.	0
The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.	0
My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight.	0
Good night, everyone.	0
