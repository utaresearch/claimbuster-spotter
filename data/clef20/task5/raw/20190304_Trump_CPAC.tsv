1	Donald Trump	Oh, thank you very much.
2	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
3	Donald Trump	And thank you very much also to a man named Matt Schlapp.
4	Donald Trump	What a job he's done.
5	Donald Trump	And to CPAC -- I actually started quite a while ago at CPAC, and came here -- probably made my first real political speech.
6	Donald Trump	And I enjoyed it so much that I came back for a second one, then a third.
7	Donald Trump	Then I said, what the hell, let's run for President.
8	Donald Trump	Right?
9	Donald Trump	But it's wonderful to be back with so many great patriots, old friends, and brave young conservatives.
10	Donald Trump	What a future you have.
11	Donald Trump	Our movement and our future in our country is unlimited.
12	Donald Trump	What we've done together has never been done in the history maybe of beyond of country, maybe in the history of the world.
13	Donald Trump	They came from the mountains and the valleys and the cities.
14	Donald Trump	They came from all over.
15	Donald Trump	And what we did in 2016 -- the Election, we call it, with a capital "E" -- it's never been done before.
16	Donald Trump	And we're going to do it, I think, again in 2020, and the numbers are going to be even bigger.
17	SYSTEM	[Audience Chants USA]
18	Donald Trump	And we all had to endure, as I was running.
19	Donald Trump	So you had 17 Republicans, plus me.
20	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
21	Donald Trump	And I was probably more of a conservative than a Republican.
22	Donald Trump	People just didn’t quite understand that.
23	Donald Trump	They didn’t understand it.
24	Donald Trump	I think now, with what we've done with the judiciary and so many other things, I think they get it very well.
25	Donald Trump	And it's driving the other side crazy.
26	Donald Trump	But we all had to endure, remember?
27	Donald Trump	How many times did you hear, for months and months, "There is no way to 270"?
28	Donald Trump	You know what that means, right?
29	Donald Trump	There is no way to 270.
30	Donald Trump	They couldn’t get me there.
31	Donald Trump	We might as well have just given up.
32	Donald Trump	But there wasn’t any way to 270.
33	Donald Trump	In fact, I actually went up to Maine to get one, and I did win the one.
34	Donald Trump	But we didn’t need the one.
35	Donald Trump	We didn’t need it.
36	Donald Trump	We won Maine.
37	Donald Trump	We won our half of Maine, remember?
38	Donald Trump	You have Nebraska.
39	Donald Trump	We won both in Nebraska.
40	Donald Trump	We won the half we had to win in Maine.
41	Donald Trump	So we got the one, but we didn’t need the one, because we didn’t get 270; we got 306 to 223.
42	Donald Trump	223-306.
43	Donald Trump	A state called Wisconsin, a state called -- Michigan, where -- by the way, where Fiat Chrysler just announced a $4.5 billion incredible -- expansion and new plant, doubling their workforce.
44	Donald Trump	Many, many car companies have moved back to Michigan and are continuing to do so.
45	Donald Trump	Big numbers.
46	Donald Trump	Nobody every thought they'd see that happen.
47	Donald Trump	So I think we're going to do even better in 2020.
48	Donald Trump	I think we're going to do numbers that people haven’t seen for a long time.
49	Donald Trump	The men and women here today are on the frontlines of protecting America’s interests, defending America’s value, and reclaiming our nation’s priceless heritage.
50	Donald Trump	It's true.
51	Donald Trump	With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals.
52	Donald Trump	These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for.
53	Donald Trump	It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense.
54	Donald Trump	It wasn’t "America first."
55	Donald Trump	In many cases, it was "America last."
56	Donald Trump	Those days are over.
57	Donald Trump	Long over.
58	Donald Trump	America is winning again.
59	Donald Trump	America is respected again.
60	Donald Trump	And the world knows it.
61	Donald Trump	When I meet with prime ministers, when I meet with presidents -- and I get along with them -- because they know that what's taken place over many years -- not just the Obama administration; long before that -- they can't believe, themselves, that they got away with it.
62	Donald Trump	They can't believe it.
63	Donald Trump	An impossible thing.
64	Donald Trump	And they like me.
65	Donald Trump	And the reason they like me -- they tell me; they say, "Mr. President..." I said -- as an example, President Xi of China, I have great respect.
66	Donald Trump	We have a great relationship.
67	Donald Trump	I say, "How is it possible that you got away with this for so long?"
68	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
69	Donald Trump	And he said, "Because nobody ever asked us to change."
70	Donald Trump	It's true.
71	Donald Trump	When they charge 40 percent tariffs on our cars going into China, and we charge them nothing coming into our country; when they raise their tariff from 10 percent to 25 percent and then to 40 percent -- and they said to me, "We expected that somebody would call and say you can't do that."
72	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
73	Donald Trump	Nobody called, so we just left it.
74	Donald Trump	And I don’t blame them.
75	Donald Trump	We should’ve been doing the same thing to them.
76	Donald Trump	But we didn’t.
77	Donald Trump	True.
78	Donald Trump	Right?
79	Donald Trump	Hard to believe.
80	Donald Trump	It's hard to believe.
81	Donald Trump	But now things are different.
82	Donald Trump	Now we're negotiating with China.
83	Donald Trump	They wouldn’t negotiate with previous administrations.
84	Donald Trump	But I found some very old laws from when our country was rich -- really rich.
85	Donald Trump	The old tariff laws -- we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty.
86	Donald Trump	But, fortunately, they weren’t terminated.
87	Donald Trump	We started getting politically correct, even back then.
88	Donald Trump	But I said, when we were doing the great things, what happened to those laws?
89	Donald Trump	And I checked, and I found 301 and 382.
90	Donald Trump	I found one, 1938, where we can do what we have to do.
91	Donald Trump	But, you know, they had a debate in -- it was really a tough time in our country because we had so much money we didn’t know what the hell to do with it.
92	Donald Trump	Tough, tough, tough.
93	Donald Trump	It was called the Great Tariff Debate.
94	Donald Trump	Mark Levin will look this up.
95	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
96	Donald Trump	And the problem is, with Mark, if I make a little mistake, he'll let us know on Sunday night.
97	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
98	Donald Trump	I got to be very careful when I talk about this.
99	Donald Trump	But it was the Great Tariff Debate of 1888.
100	Donald Trump	And the debate was: We didn’t know what to do with all of the money we were making.
101	Donald Trump	We were so rich.
102	Donald Trump	And McKinley, prior to being President, he was very strong on protecting our assets, protecting our country.
103	Donald Trump	And he made statements that, "Others cannot come into our country and steal our wealth and steal our jobs, and build their country and not defend our country.
104	Donald Trump	We can't do that.
105	Donald Trump	We can't ever allow that to happen."
106	Donald Trump	And, you know -- I don't know, maybe you know.
107	Donald Trump	You know I'm totally off-script, right?
108	SYSTEM	[Audience member calls out]
109	Donald Trump	Thank you, darling.
110	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
111	Donald Trump	You know I'm totally off script right now.
112	Donald Trump	And this is how I got elected, by being off script.
113	Donald Trump	True.
114	Donald Trump	And if we don’t go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks.
115	Donald Trump	Because we have to get it back.
116	Donald Trump	And when I look at what's happening on the other side, I encourage it. I say, "No, no..." -- I think the New Green Deal, or whatever the hell they call it --
117	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
118	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
119	Donald Trump	The Green New Deal, right?
120	Donald Trump	Green New Deal -- I encourage it.
121	Donald Trump	I think it's really something that they should promote.
122	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
123	Donald Trump	They should work hard on.
124	Donald Trump	It's something our country needs desperately.
125	Donald Trump	They have to go out and get it.
126	Donald Trump	But I'll take the other side of that argument only because I'm mandated to.
127	Donald Trump	I'm mandated.
128	Donald Trump	But they should stay with that argument.
129	Donald Trump	Never change.
130	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
131	Donald Trump	Never change.
132	Donald Trump	No planes.
133	Donald Trump	No energy.
134	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
135	Donald Trump	When the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric.
136	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
137	Donald Trump	Let's hurry up.
138	Donald Trump	Darling -- "Darling, is the wind blowing today?
139	Donald Trump	I'd like to watch television, darling."
140	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
141	Donald Trump	No, but it's true.
142	Donald Trump	So the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 -- and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted.
143	Donald Trump	We built forces up that were incredible.
144	Donald Trump	Then, in 1913, they ended tariffs, okay?
145	Donald Trump	They ended tariffs.
146	Donald Trump	Somebody got stupid and they ended tariffs.
147	Donald Trump	They said, "Oh, it's okay for other nations to come in."
148	Donald Trump	I won't use a certain words because it's not politically -- but everybody knows the word I'd love to use.
149	Donald Trump	Should I use it?
150	Donald Trump	I won't do it.
151	Donald Trump	Our great First Lady always said, "Don't use certain words, please."
152	Donald Trump	I said, "But the audience wanted me to do it."
153	Donald Trump	She said, "Don't do it."
154	Donald Trump	And the problem is, if I do do that, they won't put the little preamble that we just went through.
155	Donald Trump	They'll just use the word, and they'll said, "Isn't that terrible."
156	Donald Trump	So I won't use it.
157	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
158	Donald Trump	I've learned. Because with the fake news --
159	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
160	Donald Trump	-- if you tell a joke, if you're sarcastic, if you're having fun with the audience, if you're on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, "Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton's emails.
161	Donald Trump	Please, Russia, please."
162	Donald Trump	Please get us the emails.
163	Donald Trump	Please!
164	SYSTEM	[Audience chants Trump]
165	Donald Trump	So everybody is having a good time.
166	Donald Trump	I'm laughing, we're all having fun.
167	Donald Trump	And then that fake CNN and others say, "He asked Russia to go get the emails.
168	Donald Trump	Horrible."
169	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
170	Donald Trump	I mean, I thought -- like, two weeks ago, I'm watching and they're talking about one of the points.
171	Donald Trump	He asked Russia for the emails.
172	Donald Trump	These people are sick.
173	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
174	Donald Trump	And I'm telling you, they know the game.
175	Donald Trump	They know the game, and they play it dirty -- dirtier than anybody has ever played the game.
176	Donald Trump	Dirtier than it's ever been played.
177	Donald Trump	But the thing that we've done is very special.
178	Donald Trump	Because, on trade, and because of tariffs -- and I know there are people in the Republican Party and people -- really, even conservatives -- good conservatives -- they don’t like tariffs.
179	Donald Trump	I'm not liking or not liking.
180	Donald Trump	The minimum, the greatest negotiating tool in the history of our country.
181	Donald Trump	Do you think China would be sending their top representatives over?
182	Donald Trump	Right now, China is paying 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of technology goods.
183	Donald Trump	I was then going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion.
184	Donald Trump	Not like $200 million -- that's a lot.
185	Donald Trump	This is 200 with a "B" -- billion.
186	Donald Trump	Two-hundred billion.
187	Donald Trump	So -- but I was nice, because we're having a very strong negotiation, which if it weren’t for tariffs -- and I tell this to President Xi; this is nothing to hide.
188	Donald Trump	I would never be talking like this because, in theory, it could hurt your negotiating position.
189	Donald Trump	But in my case, it can't, because it's true.
190	Donald Trump	I was nice, and I left it at 10 percent on $200 billion.
191	Donald Trump	And here's the beauty: We've lost so much money with China -- $500 billion a year.
192	Donald Trump	And on trade, it's such a disaster; it's $507 billion a year.
193	Donald Trump	China -- just one country.
194	Donald Trump	We lose with everybody, almost.
195	Donald Trump	But China is one country.
196	Donald Trump	$507 billion, for many years.
197	Donald Trump	So the beauty is this: I have $250 billion more to put tariffs on.
198	Donald Trump	The numbers are staggering.
199	Donald Trump	Billions of dollars, right now, are pouring into our Treasury.
200	Donald Trump	And for those of you that haven’t done the research, if you look, of the 25 percent, our country -- as it's turned out, because it's now been on there for a long while.
201	Donald Trump	Our -- and I'm in no rush because I'm fine with it.
202	Donald Trump	I'm fine with it.
203	Donald Trump	Of the 25 points, we've paid for 4 points, and China has paid for 21 points.
204	Donald Trump	Okay?
205	Donald Trump	Twenty-one.
206	Donald Trump	That’s what the numbers are.
207	Donald Trump	It's very simple.
208	Donald Trump	You know, everyone said, "Oh, it's a tax on our..." It's not really.
209	Donald Trump	And what China and other countries do sometimes is they will subsidize it.
210	Donald Trump	So the tax really is incredible.
211	Donald Trump	But what it is, beyond everything else, I can negotiate.
212	Donald Trump	But then you have senators and a few congressman, but not Mark Meadows.
213	Donald Trump	Where is the great Mark Meadows?
214	Donald Trump	He's here someplace.
215	Donald Trump	Man, has he been good.
216	Donald Trump	Mark and Jim Jordan, and -- I want to name every one of those couple of hundred people.
217	Donald Trump	Because we do have a lot.
218	Donald Trump	I want to name every damn one of them.
219	Donald Trump	They have been incredible.
220	Donald Trump	They've been fighting.
221	Donald Trump	And I just see Mark in the audience.
222	Donald Trump	They've been fighting -- with Deb, much more important.
223	Donald Trump	His wife is incredible.
224	Donald Trump	What an asset.
225	Donald Trump	He would be nowhere without her.
226	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
227	Donald Trump	Right?
228	Donald Trump	But they fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together; this phony thing that now looks like it's dying.
229	Donald Trump	So they don’t have anything with Russia.
230	Donald Trump	There's no collusion.
231	Donald Trump	So now they go and morph into, "Let's inspect every deal he's ever done.
232	Donald Trump	We're going to go into his finances.
233	Donald Trump	We're going to check his deals.
234	Donald Trump	We're going to check..." These people are sick.
235	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
236	Donald Trump	They're sick.
237	Donald Trump	I saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday.
238	Donald Trump	No, it's the first time.
239	Donald Trump	He went into a meeting and he said, "We're going to look into his finances."
240	Donald Trump	I said, "Where did that come from?"
241	Donald Trump	He always talked about Russia -- collusion with Russia.
242	Donald Trump	The collusion delusion.
243	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
244	Donald Trump	So now we're waiting for a report, and we'll find out whether or not, and who we're dealing with.
245	Donald Trump	We're waiting for a report by people that weren’t elected.
246	Donald Trump	We had -- think of this: We had the greatest election -- in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson.
247	Donald Trump	This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson.
248	Donald Trump	People say that.
249	Donald Trump	No, people say it.
250	Donald Trump	I'm not saying it.
251	Donald Trump	Right?
252	Donald Trump	This was the equivalent or greater.
253	Donald Trump	You know, they used to go to Ronald Reagan, when I first started.
254	Donald Trump	This is Ronald Reagan.
255	Donald Trump	Then we started really doing well, and they were coming from everywhere to vote.
256	Donald Trump	Those red hats -- and white ones.
257	Donald Trump	The key is in the color.
258	Donald Trump	The key is what it says.
259	Donald Trump	Make America Great Again, is what it says.
260	Donald Trump	Right?
261	Donald Trump	Right?
262	Donald Trump	But we had the greatest of all time.
263	Donald Trump	Now we have people that lost.
264	Donald Trump	And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there.
265	Donald Trump	And, all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit.
266	Donald Trump	Okay?
267	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
268	Donald Trump	With bullshit.
269	Donald Trump	Now, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him.
270	Donald Trump	And as you know, the Attorney General says, "I'm going to recuse myself."
271	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
272	Donald Trump	I'm going to recuse.
273	Donald Trump	And I said, why the hell didn’t he tell me that before I put him in?
274	Donald Trump	How do you recuse yourself?
275	Donald Trump	But the person that appointed Robert Mueller never received a vote.
276	Donald Trump	Robert Mueller put 13 of the angriest Democrats in the history of our country on the commission.
277	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
278	Donald Trump	Now, how do you do that?
279	Donald Trump	These are angry, angry people.
280	Donald Trump	You take a look at them.
281	Donald Trump	One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it.
282	Donald Trump	Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I've ever seen.
283	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
284	Donald Trump	All killers.
285	Donald Trump	In fact, it would've been actually better for them if they put half and half, and Mueller can do whatever he wants anyway, which he'll probably do.
286	Donald Trump	But we have conflicts.
287	Donald Trump	I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago.
288	Donald Trump	I said, why isn’t that mentioned?
289	Donald Trump	He wanted the job as FBI Director.
290	Donald Trump	I mean, these are things that are out there; they know it.
291	Donald Trump	Why isn’t that -- and I didn’t give it to him.
292	Donald Trump	Why isn’t that mentioned? Jim Comey -- Lyin' James Comey --
293	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
294	Donald Trump	-- is his best friend.
295	Donald Trump	James Comey is his best friend.
296	Donald Trump	And those are a few of the conflicts.
297	Donald Trump	Other than that, it's wonderful.
298	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
299	Donald Trump	So -- so everybody is waiting.
300	Donald Trump	I thought of it this morning, Mark.
301	Donald Trump	And I heard you made an incredible speech and statement today.
302	Donald Trump	Mark Levin.
303	Donald Trump	I heard it was incredible.
304	Donald Trump	And I was on the way.
305	Donald Trump	But I'll see it later.
306	Donald Trump	I guarantee I'll be watching it later.
307	Donald Trump	I have one of the great inventions in history.
308	Donald Trump	It's called TiVo.
309	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
310	Donald Trump	I think it's actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right?
311	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
312	Donald Trump	But I'll be watching it later, Mark.
313	Donald Trump	But people that got no votes.
314	Donald Trump	But I heard this morning, "President Trump is waiting for the Mueller report."
315	Donald Trump	I said, wait a minute, let me get this straight.
316	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
317	Donald Trump	So the Attorney General recuses himself, and I don’t fire him.
318	Donald Trump	No obstruction.
319	Donald Trump	That's the other thing: If you use your right, if you use your power, if you use Article 2, it's called obstruction.
320	Donald Trump	But only for Trump.
321	Donald Trump	For nobody else.
322	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
323	Donald Trump	So the Attorney General is weak and ineffective, and he doesn’t do what he should've done.
324	Donald Trump	Somebody that never got a vote writes a powerful letter -- horrible -- about Comey.
325	Donald Trump	Every single Democrat said Comey should be fired, or worse, if possible.
326	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
327	Donald Trump	Every Republican said -- everybody -- in fact, when I fired Comey, I said, "You know..." -- First Lady -- I said, "Melania, I'm doing something today.
328	Donald Trump	I'm doing it because it really has to be done."
329	Donald Trump	He's bad.
330	Donald Trump	He's a bad, bad -- he's a bad, bad guy.
331	Donald Trump	That's been proven now with all of the emails and the texts.
332	Donald Trump	I'm doing something that has to be done.
333	Donald Trump	But you know the good news?
334	Donald Trump	It's going to be bipartisan.
335	Donald Trump	It's going to be so popular, it's going to be bipartisan.
336	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
337	Donald Trump	Every Democrat hates him.
338	Donald Trump	Every Republican hates him.
339	Donald Trump	He did a horrible job at the FBI.
340	Donald Trump	Speak to the real agents, the real people.
341	Donald Trump	Because the people in the FBI are incredible people -- not the sleaze on top.
342	Donald Trump	And I said to the First Lady -- I said, "But you know the good news?
343	Donald Trump	The good news is that this is going to be so bipartisan.
344	Donald Trump	Everyone is going to love it."
345	Donald Trump	So we fire Comey.
346	Donald Trump	And Schumer -- who called for his resignation many times -- Podesta, I believe that day -- because he still hasn’t gotten over getting his ass kicked, okay?
347	Donald Trump	I believe that day called for his resignation.
348	Donald Trump	That day.
349	Donald Trump	Podesta, the great genius of campaigns.
350	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
351	Donald Trump	He called for the Comey resignation.
352	Donald Trump	Others -- almost every, I would say.
353	Donald Trump	Mark, would you say virtually every Democrat, virtually every -- I can't think of anybody that said he's doing a good job.
354	Donald Trump	So I said to Melania, "Melania, the good news, this will be a popular thing."
355	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
356	Donald Trump	And I fire a bad cop.
357	Donald Trump	I fire a dirty cop.
358	Donald Trump	And all of a sudden, the Democrats say, "How dare he fire him.
359	Donald Trump	How dare he do this."
360	Donald Trump	And that's where we are, folks.
361	Donald Trump	That's where we are.
362	Donald Trump	We're in this swamp of Washington, D.C.
363	Donald Trump	But you know what?
364	Donald Trump	We're winning, and they're not.
365	Donald Trump	We're winning.
366	Donald Trump	So, just to finish -- and I'll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this.
367	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
368	Donald Trump	He's saying, "This is a lot more than we paid for."
369	Donald Trump	You know, normally you read a few pages and you say, "Bye, folks."
370	Donald Trump	But you know what I like about this?
371	Donald Trump	Number one, I'm in love, and you're in love.
372	Donald Trump	We're all in love together.
373	Donald Trump	We've done something that nobody has ever done.
374	Donald Trump	Right?
375	Donald Trump	It's easy.
376	Donald Trump	No, it's easy.
377	Donald Trump	You know, a great friend of mine from New York, he's a stone-cold killer.
378	Donald Trump	He's a brutal man. He's actually not even a good friend of mine because he'd turn on me in two seconds if it was
379	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
380	Donald Trump	.
381	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
382	Donald Trump	But he's a very rich guy.
383	Donald Trump	And he said, "What are you going to speak about today?
384	Donald Trump	Like, what are you going to speak?"
385	Donald Trump	I said, "I don't know.
386	Donald Trump	I don't know."
387	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
388	Donald Trump	He said, "I just heard that you have the biggest crowd in the history of CPAC.
389	Donald Trump	They're all over.
390	Donald Trump	By the way, not only in this giant room.
391	Donald Trump	They're in many hotel rooms all over the place.
392	Donald Trump	You're just better at real estate than they are."
393	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
394	Donald Trump	True.
395	Donald Trump	But this guy -- you all know his name -- very rich guy.
396	Donald Trump	And he has a problem with a thing called public speaking.
397	Donald Trump	If he has to speak to more than like five people, he chokes.
398	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
399	Donald Trump	He can't breathe.
400	Donald Trump	You know, juh-juh.
401	Donald Trump	Are you okay?
402	Donald Trump	He kills people for a living -- meaning mentally and financially -- but if there's like an audience of nine, it's like "augh."
403	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
404	Donald Trump	So he said to me, "How the hell do you do that?"
405	Donald Trump	And I said, "It's easy."
406	Donald Trump	And the reason it's easy -- I really mean this -- there's so much love in this room, it's easy to talk.
407	Donald Trump	You can talk your heart out.
408	Donald Trump	You really could.
409	Donald Trump	There's love in this room.
410	Donald Trump	You can talk your heart out.
411	Donald Trump	It's easy.
412	Donald Trump	It's easy.
413	Donald Trump	It's easy.
414	Donald Trump	And we've had that from the day I came down with your First Lady on the escalator in Trump Tower.
415	Donald Trump	It's been easy.
416	Donald Trump	And you know what?
417	Donald Trump	We never had an empty seat.
418	Donald Trump	We went out and helped Ted Cruz.
419	Donald Trump	We went out and helped so many people.
420	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what: If we didn’t do those 32 rallies -- and it wasn’t easy.
421	Donald Trump	When you're doing rallies with 25-, 30,000 people -- in Texas, we had 109,000 people sign up.
422	Donald Trump	We used the Houston Rockets arena; it holds 22,000.
423	Donald Trump	Tens of thousands were outside.
424	Donald Trump	We were sending notices, "Please don’t come."
425	Donald Trump	That's a little different.
426	Donald Trump	Usually, people are begging.
427	Donald Trump	Well, yeah, like can somebody come?
428	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
429	Donald Trump	We never had an empty seat. Of course, the Washington Post -- a guy named David Weigel -- he wrote an article, some arena --
430	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
431	Donald Trump	No, listen to this.
432	Donald Trump	He wrote an article.
433	Donald Trump	He got there four hours early.
434	Donald Trump	He took pictures of an empty arena.
435	Donald Trump	He then put out a note -- something to the effect, "Not very good crowd size, Mr.
436	Donald Trump	President."
437	Donald Trump	And I never saw it because I don’t follow the guy.
438	Donald Trump	But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldn’t get in -- he got there four or five hours early because he doesn’t fly private.
439	Donald Trump	You know.
440	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
441	Donald Trump	And maybe it's because of the carbon footprint.
442	Donald Trump	You think maybe that's it?
443	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
444	Donald Trump	Maybe.
445	Donald Trump	Must be the carbon footprint.
446	Donald Trump	He just doesn’t want private.
447	Donald Trump	But he got there hours early.
448	Donald Trump	And, you know, the place hadn’t started taking in people.
449	Donald Trump	They weren’t going to take them in.
450	Donald Trump	So there were virtually nobody.
451	Donald Trump	And, you know, whatever it was -- 18,000 -- when you have nobody, it's a little scary-looking.
452	Donald Trump	So he took pictures.
453	Donald Trump	And you know who really got even?
454	Donald Trump	Our people.
455	Donald Trump	Because they were incensed.
456	Donald Trump	We had people sitting on the stairwells.
457	Donald Trump	We had people sitting in every seat.
458	Donald Trump	I don’t think we've had an empty seat since we announced.
459	Donald Trump	And from the day we came down the escalator, I really don’t believe we've had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium.
460	Donald Trump	It's been an incredible thing.
461	Donald Trump	And that's why I say this has never, ever happened before, and now we have to verify it in 2020 with an even bigger victory.
462	SYSTEM	[Applause, Audience chants Four More Years]
463	Donald Trump	And, by the way, just to finish that story, the great Sarah Huckabee and Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here -- Mercedes, thank you.
464	Donald Trump	They always say -- you know, they're good people, right?
465	Donald Trump	Much better than I am.
466	Donald Trump	They always say, "Don't bring it up.
467	Donald Trump	Don’t fight.
468	Donald Trump	Don’t fight.
469	Donald Trump	Everyone understands."
470	Donald Trump	I said, "They don’t understand."
471	Donald Trump	If I don’t explain it, how are they going to understand?
472	Donald Trump	So remember the arena one, right?
473	Donald Trump	And then it was shown.
474	Donald Trump	And the Washington Post had to do -- and this particular writer -- had to do a -- I thought he was going to get fired.
475	Donald Trump	I mean, if that were a conservative, he would've been fired on the spot.
476	Donald Trump	He would've been humiliated for what he did.
477	Donald Trump	Because it was fake news.
478	Donald Trump	Nobody was in the arena.
479	Donald Trump	There were thousands outside but they hadn’t opened the gates yet.
480	Donald Trump	They did the same thing at our big inauguration speech.
481	Donald Trump	You take a look at those crowds.
482	Donald Trump	And I watched one of the evening shows that are ridiculous, how horrible they are, how mean -- how horrible.
483	Donald Trump	And I watched it by mistake.
484	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
485	Donald Trump	And they showed -- they showed from the White House all the way down.
486	Donald Trump	They showed from the Cap- -- they showed -- there were people.
487	Donald Trump	Nobody has ever seen it.
488	Donald Trump	The Capitol down to the Washington Monument -- people.
489	Donald Trump	But I saw pictures that there were no people.
490	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
491	Donald Trump	Those pictures were taken hours before.
492	Donald Trump	Right?
493	Donald Trump	And they always mention crowd size.
494	Donald Trump	He talks about crowd size.
495	Donald Trump	So I'm constantly bugging Mercedes.
496	Donald Trump	Whenever we have a slow moment, I say, "Mercedes" -- and Sarah -- "show them the pictures.
497	Donald Trump	Show them.
498	Donald Trump	And compare them with what they put on television.
499	Donald Trump	Those pictures were taken hours before."
500	Donald Trump	And remember this also -- not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument.
501	Donald Trump	And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet.
502	Donald Trump	And women and men -- and I consider them totally equal, so I'm not going to say it's harder.
503	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
504	Donald Trump	In fact, it's probably, with the men I know, it's actually easier for the women to make the walk, right?
505	SYSTEM	[Audience Calls Out No]
506	Donald Trump	But they had to walk all the way down.
507	Donald Trump	They had to walk with high heels, in many cases.
508	Donald Trump	They had to walk all the way down to the Washington Monument and then back.
509	Donald Trump	And I looked, and I made a speech, and I said, before I got on -- I said to the people that were sitting next to me, "I've never seen anything like this.
510	Donald Trump	Look at that crowd."
511	Donald Trump	And it was wide.
512	Donald Trump	Wide.
513	Donald Trump	We had a crowd -- I've never seen anything like it.
514	Donald Trump	And I have to live -- I have to live with "crowd size."
515	Donald Trump	It's all a phony deal.
516	Donald Trump	But I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people.
517	Donald Trump	It was taken hours before our great day.
518	Donald Trump	That was a great day for us.
519	Donald Trump	That was a great, great day.
520	Donald Trump	People came from all over.
521	Donald Trump	People came from all over.
522	Donald Trump	So, Sarah said, and Mercedes said, "Sir, it doesn’t matter.
523	Donald Trump	Nobody cares."
524	Donald Trump	I said, "But I care."
525	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
526	Donald Trump	And people care.
527	Donald Trump	People care.
528	Donald Trump	So what I'm going to do is I'll give it to the great one.
529	Donald Trump	I'll give it to Mark Levin.
530	Donald Trump	And I'll give him the picture.
531	Donald Trump	Then I'll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field -- like nobody on it.
532	Donald Trump	And you'll see the sun.
533	Donald Trump	You know, you can see it's very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right?
534	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
535	Donald Trump	And you can have some fun.
536	Donald Trump	You're going to get big ratings on your show, I'll tell you that.
537	Donald Trump	Sunday night, everybody.
538	Donald Trump	Sunday night.
539	Donald Trump	Huh?
540	Donald Trump	Ten o'clock, right?
541	Donald Trump	Sunday night at 10 o'clock.
542	SYSTEM	[Audience Member Calls Out, Trump laughs]
543	Donald Trump	Thank you.
544	Donald Trump	I knew that, actually.
545	Donald Trump	But thank you.
546	Donald Trump	All right, now let's get back to what I'm here for.
547	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
548	Donald Trump	And don't fall asleep.
549	Donald Trump	Don’t fall asleep, right?
550	Donald Trump	Don’t fall asleep.
551	Donald Trump	You know, somebody said, "Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible."
552	Donald Trump	They said it was incredible.
553	Donald Trump	They said that was so great.
554	Donald Trump	And I said -- I said -- I did; I got great reviews, even from some of the really bad ones out there.
555	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
556	Donald Trump	Of course, by the following morning, they had to change because the head people called up, "What are you doing?"
557	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
558	Donald Trump	A lot of it is not the people on television, you know.
559	Donald Trump	A lot of it is their bosses -- which someday we're going to have to figure out why, Meadows, why that is.
560	Donald Trump	Because, you know, if you're building a great country, you have the best employment and unemployment numbers we've ever had.
561	Donald Trump	More people are working today in the United States than ever before in the history of our country.
562	Donald Trump	And you say, why are they upset by that?
563	Donald Trump	Why?
564	Donald Trump	Why are they upset by that?
565	Donald Trump	We've slashed 30,000 pages of job-killing regulations from the Federal Register.
566	Donald Trump	That's an all-time record in the history of the United States, even by Presidents there for eight years, and in one case more.
567	Donald Trump	We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.
568	Donald Trump	And we got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big deal.
569	Donald Trump	Which should lead to the ending of the disaster known as Obamacare.
570	Donald Trump	It should.
571	Donald Trump	The great state of Texas has a case, and it was literally based on the individual mandate.
572	Donald Trump	Now that it's gone, I don't know how they rule against it.
573	Donald Trump	Now we'll have to find out.
574	Donald Trump	But that'll soon be up in the Supreme Court of the United States, I hope.
575	Donald Trump	And we're going to see what happens.
576	Donald Trump	And then we're going to get together with the Democrats and come up with really great healthcare, okay?
577	Donald Trump	Really great healthcare.
578	Donald Trump	And of the other things we did in our tax package is ANWR.
579	Donald Trump	Perhaps the largest field in the world -- oil and gas.
580	Donald Trump	I got it approved.
581	Donald Trump	And I didn’t want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly.
582	Donald Trump	Very badly.
583	Donald Trump	Don’t get that vote very often.
584	Donald Trump	And I said, you know, I don’t want to get it.
585	Donald Trump	Then I get a call from a friend of mine, and he's in the oil business.
586	Donald Trump	He's not asking for anything.
587	Donald Trump	He said -- but he really is a knowledgeable guy when it comes to oil and gas.
588	Donald Trump	He said to me, "Hey" -- and they all call me "Mr.
589	Donald Trump	President."
590	Donald Trump	I have friends that, for 35 years, "Hey, Don, how you doing?
591	Donald Trump	Hey, Donny.
592	Donald Trump	I love you, Donny."
593	Donald Trump	For 35 years.
594	Donald Trump	Now they call, "Mr. President, sir."
595	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
596	Donald Trump	How are you?
597	Donald Trump	I have a friend -- a very rich guy -- Richard LeFrak, in New York.
598	Donald Trump	A builder.
599	Donald Trump	A good builder.
600	Donald Trump	He calls me all my life, "Hey, Don, how you doing?"
601	Donald Trump	I've known this guy so long -- from kindergarten.
602	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
603	Donald Trump	It's true.
604	Donald Trump	Hi, Don, how you doing?
605	Donald Trump	How's everything?
606	Donald Trump	And now I get a call the other day, "Mr. President, how are you, sir?
607	Donald Trump	How are you?"
608	Donald Trump	I said, "Richard, lighten up.
609	Donald Trump	Lighten up."
610	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
611	Donald Trump	Call me 'Donald'.
612	Donald Trump	Richard, call me 'Donald'.
613	Donald Trump	You've known me for -- I don’t want to say, because I don’t want my wife to hear the number."
614	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
615	Donald Trump	But -- it's true.
616	Donald Trump	Actually, that's true.
617	Donald Trump	That's actually true.
618	Donald Trump	Richard came up; he said, "I've known your husband for 65 years."
619	Donald Trump	I said, "Don’t say that."
620	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
621	Donald Trump	I say, "Say 25, 30.
622	Donald Trump	Don’t say 65 years."
623	Donald Trump	But I said, "Richard -- Richard, call me 'Donald', like you always do.
624	Donald Trump	Call me 'Don'."
625	Donald Trump	Okay.
626	Donald Trump	Okay, Don.
627	Donald Trump	Okay.
628	Donald Trump	He gets his breath.
629	Donald Trump	Uh-huh. Two minutes later -- "Mr. President..."
630	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
631	Donald Trump	That's called respect for the office, right?
632	Donald Trump	Maybe that's a good thing, right?
633	Donald Trump	Many -- many of my friends.
634	Donald Trump	And that wasn’t in the script either, Mark.
635	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
636	Donald Trump	But we're renegotiating, right now, horrible trade deals that we're cracking down -- and we are really doing a number -- cracking down on countries that cheat, and standing up for the American worker for the first time in many, many decades.
637	Donald Trump	Many decades.
638	Donald Trump	Our workers have been treated horribly.
639	Donald Trump	A country announces they're closing their plant in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Ohio -- they're closing.
640	Donald Trump	They're closing a plant; they're going to move to Mexico.
641	Donald Trump	They're going to move to China.
642	Donald Trump	They're going to move someplace else.
643	Donald Trump	They fire all their workers.
644	Donald Trump	And then they sell their cars, no tax; just make them in Mexico, sell them back to here.
645	Donald Trump	No tax, no nothing.
646	Donald Trump	Those days are all gone, folks.
647	Donald Trump	They're all gone.
648	Donald Trump	They're all gone.
649	Donald Trump	And in the new deal with Mexico and Canada, called the USMCA, it's very, very hard -- prohibitively hard -- for a company to fire its 4,000 workers and move to Mexico or some other location.
650	Donald Trump	It's now a very costly -- they can do it, I guess, if they want.
651	Donald Trump	But it's costly.
652	Donald Trump	It's painful.
653	Donald Trump	It used to be almost -- I said -- I used to -- I've been talking about this for a long time.
654	Donald Trump	I used to say it's almost like we're giving them an incentive to leave our country.
655	Donald Trump	Again, I'm for America first.
656	Donald Trump	That wasn’t for America first.
657	Donald Trump	And we have great companies that are now moving back to our country.
658	Donald Trump	They're coming back in.
659	Donald Trump	They're coming back in.
660	Donald Trump	And, by the way, you know I'm building the wall.
661	Donald Trump	We're finishing the wall.
662	Donald Trump	We got a lot of money.
663	Donald Trump	It's in the thing.
664	SYSTEM	[Audience chants Build that Wall]
665	Donald Trump	But -- and there will be some people in the room that don’t like this.
666	Donald Trump	We're down to 3.7 percent unemployment -- the lowest number in a long time.
667	Donald Trump	But think of this: I got all these companies moving in.
668	Donald Trump	They need workers.
669	Donald Trump	We have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place.
670	Donald Trump	This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign because I never knew we would be as successful as we've been.
671	Donald Trump	Companies are roaring back into our country, and now we want people to come in.
672	Donald Trump	We need workers to come in, but they've got to come in legally, and they've got to come in through merit, merit, merit.
673	SYSTEM	[Audience Chants USA]
674	Donald Trump	They've got to come in through merit.
675	Donald Trump	They have to be people that can help us.
676	Donald Trump	They have to be people that can love our country, not hate our country.
677	Donald Trump	We have people in Congress -- right now, we have people in Congress that hate our country.
678	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
679	Donald Trump	And you know that.
680	Donald Trump	And we can name every one of them if they want.
681	Donald Trump	They hate our country.
682	Donald Trump	It's sad.
683	Donald Trump	It's very sad.
684	Donald Trump	When I see some of the things being made, the statements being made, it's very, very sad.
685	Donald Trump	Very, very -- and find out, how did they do in their country?
686	Donald Trump	Just ask them, how did they do?
687	Donald Trump	Did they do well?
688	Donald Trump	Were they succeeding?
689	Donald Trump	Just ask that question.
690	Donald Trump	Somebody would say, "Oh, that's terrible that he brings that up."
691	Donald Trump	But that's okay, I don’t mind.
692	Donald Trump	I'll bring it up.
693	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
694	Donald Trump	How did they do in their country?
695	Donald Trump	Not so good.
696	Donald Trump	Not so good.
697	Donald Trump	But we need workers.
698	Donald Trump	We have to bring in workers.
699	Donald Trump	One other thing -- because we have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes.
700	Donald Trump	We have some senators.
701	Donald Trump	We have some congressmen.
702	Donald Trump	When a senator tells us that he's a free trader, so am I. I'm a fair trader.
703	Donald Trump	I'm a free trader.
704	Donald Trump	But when a senator said we can't do tariffs, where we make a fortune, or at a minimum, we're able to use this tremendous power that I found -- tremendous -- old stuff.
705	Donald Trump	Nobody even knew it existed.
706	Donald Trump	I'm able to use it, at a minimum, to negotiate great and fair trade deals.
707	Donald Trump	They wouldn't even be talking to us because it's so one-sided.
708	Donald Trump	Last year, we lost eight hundred -- this for many years -- almost $800 billion on trade.
709	Donald Trump	It's not sustainable.
710	Donald Trump	You can't do that.
711	Donald Trump	And now we're making great trade deals.
712	Donald Trump	But when some of the senators -- good people; I think they're good people.
713	Donald Trump	I just don't understand the thinking.
714	Donald Trump	So I say, India is a very high-tariff nation.
715	Donald Trump	They charge us a lot.
716	Donald Trump	When we send a motorcycle to India, it's 100 percent tariff.
717	Donald Trump	They charge 100 percent.
718	Donald Trump	When India sends a motorcycle to us, we brilliantly charge them nothing.
719	Donald Trump	So I want a reciprocal tax, or at least I want to charge a tax.
720	Donald Trump	It's called a mirror tax, but it's a reciprocal tax.
721	Donald Trump	Now, here's what I don't understand: I've had a lot of people -- Lindsey Graham.
722	Donald Trump	I said, Lindsey -- it's not his thing necessarily.
723	Donald Trump	It's not the thing that he's most adept at.
724	Donald Trump	But he's adept and he's smart.
725	Donald Trump	I said, "Lindsey, if they charge us a hundred, I'd like a reci-..." If they charge us, we charge them.
726	Donald Trump	He goes, "That makes sense to me."
727	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
728	Donald Trump	And then he gets on to judiciary and things that, frankly, he likes and finds very interesting.
729	Donald Trump	But he's a smart guy, and he said -- I'll never forget.
730	Donald Trump	It took me about a minute, which is a long time.
731	Donald Trump	I did a bad description.
732	Donald Trump	It's so easy.
733	Donald Trump	They charge 100; we charge nothing.
734	Donald Trump	Now we have reciprocal, so it's 100.
735	Donald Trump	But what happens now, for those that really think about tariffs and don't like tariffs for whatever reason might be -- and that's okay.
736	Donald Trump	What's going to happen is, in many cases, instead of 100 and 100, you're going to have zero and zero, so you won't have any tariff.
737	Donald Trump	Okay?
738	Donald Trump	It's going to happen.
739	Donald Trump	That's going to happen.
740	Donald Trump	But you have to -- you have to start working on some of the senators that say "I can't approve this deal."
741	Donald Trump	I say, "You know what?
742	Donald Trump	I want to just charge India" -- as an example, I'm using it.
743	Donald Trump	But India is a very high-tariff nation.
744	Donald Trump	I mean, nobody -- nobody knows it because nobody knows what they're doing in Washington.
745	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
746	Donald Trump	But India is a very, very high-tariff nation, and they charge tremendous -- tremendous numbers.
747	Donald Trump	So they charge 100.
748	Donald Trump	So I say, "I'm not going to charge 100, but I'm going to charge 25 percent."
749	Donald Trump	And I hear this turmoil in the Senate because we're charging 25.
750	Donald Trump	So I call a couple of the guys up.
751	Donald Trump	I say, "Fellas, listen, they're charging us 100 for the exact same product.
752	Donald Trump	I want to charge them 25."
753	Donald Trump	And I feel so foolish charging 25 because it should be 100.
754	Donald Trump	But I'm doing 25 only because of you.
755	Donald Trump	I want to get your support.
756	Donald Trump	Sir, that's not free trade.
757	Donald Trump	Where do these people come from?
758	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
759	Donald Trump	Where do they come from?
760	Donald Trump	Where?
761	Donald Trump	Where do they come from?
762	Donald Trump	I need your help.
763	Donald Trump	I need your help -- the voters' help.
764	Donald Trump	Where do they come from?
765	Donald Trump	So it can only be one of two or three things.
766	Donald Trump	Number one, I know they're very smart people.
767	Donald Trump	I know they are.
768	Donald Trump	And I even like some of them.
769	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
770	Donald Trump	But they're smart.
771	Donald Trump	So we take that out of the equation.
772	Donald Trump	So even -- and I know they don't have evil intentions.
773	Donald Trump	And the other thing could be, I guess, maybe -- you know, these companies are all owned by people, and these people are very generous.
774	Donald Trump	Campaign contributions -- they're very, very generous people.
775	Donald Trump	Can that be possible?
776	Donald Trump	I don't think so.
777	Donald Trump	I hope not.
778	Donald Trump	Because we're talking about our country.
779	Donald Trump	We can't allow a country to charge 100 percent and we get nothing for the same exact product.
780	Donald Trump	For one thing, they don't respect us.
781	Donald Trump	They think we're "stupido."
782	Donald Trump	They don't respect us.
783	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
784	Donald Trump	But let me tell you something: The world respects our country again.
785	Donald Trump	They respect us.
786	Donald Trump	And America is now booming like never before.
787	Donald Trump	Other countries are doing very poorly.
788	Donald Trump	Other countries are doing very poorly, and that makes it even harder for us to be successful.
789	Donald Trump	Plus, we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the Fed.
790	Donald Trump	We have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed.
791	Donald Trump	We have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the Fed.
792	Donald Trump	So with all of those things -- and we want a strong dollar, but let's be reasonable.
793	Donald Trump	You understand that.
794	Donald Trump	With all of that, we're doing great.
795	Donald Trump	Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were?
796	Donald Trump	There's no inflation, essentially.
797	Donald Trump	There's no inflation.
798	Donald Trump	Can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were?
799	Donald Trump	If we didn't do quantitative tightening, taking money out of the market?
800	Donald Trump	If we didn't do quantitative -- and this would lead to a little bit lower dollar.
801	Donald Trump	A little bit.
802	Donald Trump	I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's going to be great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it is prohibitive for us to be dealing with other nations and taking their business.
803	Donald Trump	Since the election, we've created a number that if I would have said during the campaign, the fake news just back there would have said this is crazy.
804	Donald Trump	5.3 million new jobs, including over, now, 600,000 beautiful, brand-new manufacturing jobs that were never going to come back to our country.
805	Donald Trump	These are jobs that were never coming back to our country.
806	Donald Trump	Remember?
807	Donald Trump	Not to talk badly about the other administration, but if that theory went forward with Crooked Hillary winning the election, instead of being up almost 50 percent with the stock market, you would have been down 50 percent.
808	Donald Trump	It was heading down.
809	Donald Trump	It was going to be a disaster.
810	Donald Trump	We have nearly 5 million Americans that have been lifted off of food stamps.
811	Donald Trump	Nobody ever thought that was possible.
812	Donald Trump	The unemployment rate has reached the lowest in over 51 years.
813	Donald Trump	And African American -- and you've heard me say this many times -- Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates are at their all-time historic lows.
814	Donald Trump	And African American income has reached an all-time high. So when I'm on the debate stage with one of these maniacs --
815	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
816	Donald Trump	-- I mean, trains to Hawaii.
817	Donald Trump	How do you get to Europe?
818	Donald Trump	We haven't figured that one out yet.
819	Donald Trump	We don't use airplanes anymore.
820	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
821	Donald Trump	You saw what I'm doing in California, right?
822	Donald Trump	They have a fast train.
823	Donald Trump	The fast train goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
824	Donald Trump	It's over budget by hundreds of billions of dollars, so they have a great idea -- the new governor; nice guy.
825	Donald Trump	Yeah, he's a nice guy.
826	Donald Trump	When I'm with him face to face, nice.
827	Donald Trump	When he speaks about me, not so nice.
828	Donald Trump	But face to face, he loves me.
829	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
830	Donald Trump	He called me up.
831	Donald Trump	He said, "You're a great President.
832	Donald Trump	You're doing a great job."
833	Donald Trump	He actually did, two weeks ago, three weeks.
834	Donald Trump	So he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House.
835	Donald Trump	Everybody else does.
836	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
837	Donald Trump	Check them.
838	Donald Trump	Check them.
839	Donald Trump	Check them.
840	Donald Trump	Called me up three or four weeks ago.
841	Donald Trump	I think they need some forest money, because honestly, the management of the forests is very bad and that's one of the problems they have.
842	Donald Trump	I said, "You got to get those forests."
843	Donald Trump	We can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives, more importantly.
844	Donald Trump	Got to clean it up.
845	Donald Trump	It's called management.
846	Donald Trump	When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out.
847	Donald Trump	It becomes like a matchstick, that tree.
848	Donald Trump	It hits a flame, it goes up.
849	Donald Trump	The leaves -- every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so -- a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it.
850	Donald Trump	The thing catches on fire and we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed.
851	Donald Trump	You got to have management.
852	Donald Trump	But he called me up the other day, recently -- let's say four weeks ago or so.
853	Donald Trump	He said, "I just want to tell you you're a great President and you're one of the smartest people I've ever met."
854	Donald Trump	That's what he said.
855	Donald Trump	Now, that's what he said.
856	Donald Trump	Will he admit it?
857	Donald Trump	No, I doubt it.
858	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
859	Donald Trump	But that's what he said.
860	Donald Trump	And you're doing a great job. And then he did start talking about, in all fairness, additional money for the fire, which is --
861	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
862	Donald Trump	-- it's okay.
863	Donald Trump	That's okay.
864	Donald Trump	We have great talks.
865	Donald Trump	I mean, I like him.
866	Donald Trump	Gavin Newsom.
867	Donald Trump	I like him.
868	Donald Trump	Nice guy.
869	Donald Trump	But they say things -- you know, politicians, they say things to your face, and then you see two days later they're giving a news conference -- just like, where did that guy come from?
870	Donald Trump	Where did he come from?
871	Donald Trump	But everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well -- except, of course, for the Never Trumpers.
872	Donald Trump	But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
873	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
874	Donald Trump	Mouth to mouth.
875	Donald Trump	Mouth to mouth.
876	Donald Trump	They're hanging in.
877	Donald Trump	A couple of them.
878	Donald Trump	I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong.
879	Donald Trump	Not only Never Trumpers.
880	Donald Trump	You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline.
881	Donald Trump	They're basically dishonest people -- because, look, let's face it: Whether you like me or not -- if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges -- it'll soon be 145 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges.
882	Donald Trump	And 17 appellate division judges.
883	Donald Trump	That we've got the best economy maybe in our history.
884	Donald Trump	That we've got the best employment numbers and unemployment numbers in our history.
885	Donald Trump	That we've cut more regulations in two years than any President has ever done, whether it's for eight or beyond.
886	Donald Trump	That we've taken care of our military with -- $1.7 billion.
887	Donald Trump	Think of that.
888	Donald Trump	Think of what we did.
889	Donald Trump	Think of what we did with our military.
890	Donald Trump	Think of the numbers that we have for our military.
891	Donald Trump	We have numbers -- nobody has ever heard of these numbers before.
892	Donald Trump	And you know, part of the problem that we have -- because I'm a cost cutter.
893	Donald Trump	But -- and you are all cost cutters.
894	Donald Trump	But we have to take care of our military.
895	Donald Trump	We have to.
896	Donald Trump	Seven hundred billions dollars we spent.
897	Donald Trump	And that was the first year.
898	Donald Trump	And then the second year, $716 billion.
899	Donald Trump	Now, I have no choice.
900	Donald Trump	I'd like to spend much less.
901	Donald Trump	Obama was spending much less but our military was being depleted.
902	Donald Trump	He was fighting in endless wars; they'd never end.
903	Donald Trump	And, by the way, as of probably today or tomorrow, we will actually have 100 percent of the caliphate in Syria.
904	Donald Trump	One hundred percent.
905	Donald Trump	One hundred percent.
906	Donald Trump	And we'll leave a small group of guys and gals.
907	Donald Trump	But we want to bring our people back home.
908	Donald Trump	We want to bring our people back home.
909	Donald Trump	It's time.
910	Donald Trump	Been in these wars.
911	Donald Trump	We were going to be in Syria for four months.
912	Donald Trump	We ended up five years.
913	Donald Trump	This fighting -- they just like to fight.
914	Donald Trump	We want to fix our country.
915	Donald Trump	We want to fix our bridges, our highways, our roads, our schools.
916	Donald Trump	We want to fix our country up.
917	Donald Trump	It's time.
918	Donald Trump	It's time.
919	Donald Trump	But I was told by a general, who I had to fire -- I said, "General, how long before we get 100 percent of the caliphate?"
920	Donald Trump	He said, "Sir, two years."
921	Donald Trump	I said, "I can't take it two years."
922	Donald Trump	And then I flew to Iraq; first time I left the White House -- because I stayed in the White House for months and months because I wanted the Democrats to get back from their vacations from Hawaii and these other places.
923	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
924	Donald Trump	And I figured it would look good if I stayed in the White House so that you people all love me and vote for me, okay?
925	Donald Trump	I figured it would look good.
926	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
927	Donald Trump	I figured it would look good.
928	Donald Trump	So I stayed in the White House.
929	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you what: I was there -- I told my wife, "Go to Florida.
930	Donald Trump	Enjoy your Christmas."
931	Donald Trump	I stayed for Thanksgiving.
932	Donald Trump	I said -- I mean, I was in the White House for a long time.
933	Donald Trump	Months.
934	Donald Trump	Months.
935	Donald Trump	I had cabin fever in the White House.
936	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
937	Donald Trump	But if you've got to have cabin fever, that's the place to do it, okay?
938	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
939	Donald Trump	But I was there, I don't know, for a number of months, through Christmas.
940	Donald Trump	I spent my New Year's all by myself.
941	SYSTEM	[Laughter, Audience calls out Awww]
942	Donald Trump	Don't cry.
943	Donald Trump	All -- it was me and about 500 men and women outside with machine guns.
944	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
945	Donald Trump	I never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns.
946	Donald Trump	I'd look at that equipment and I'd say, "Man..." They sit in the trees.
947	Donald Trump	They sit on the lawn.
948	Donald Trump	I told people, "I'm in this mess" -- you know, people don't know how big the White House.
949	Donald Trump	First of all, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world.
950	Donald Trump	It's really -- I made a lot of money with luxury.
951	Donald Trump	This building is -- 1799 -- which, of course, when President Xi comes, I say "1799," like it's old.
952	Donald Trump	To him, that's like a brand-new house in China.
953	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
954	Donald Trump	In China, they go back -- they go back 8,000 years.
955	Donald Trump	So that's -- that's like a new -- that's like a new residence.
956	Donald Trump	But I sat in the White House for months and months, except I took a day off.
957	Donald Trump	I flew to a lovely place called Iraq, and I flew at night and I got there at night.
958	Donald Trump	And I said to myself, this is interesting, because they say, "Sir, all of the lights in the plane, sir, are going off."
959	Donald Trump	I say, "Why?"
960	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
961	Donald Trump	Because we're getting ready to land.
962	Donald Trump	We're an hour out.
963	Donald Trump	I said, "What about the shades?"
964	Donald Trump	Well, we want it better than that. May be like 
965	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
966	Donald Trump	So we turned the lights off, put the shades down.
967	Donald Trump	This is a big seven forty -- Air Force One.
968	Donald Trump	And we're landing, and I go up and I look.
969	Donald Trump	And I've landed; I like to sit with pilots.
970	Donald Trump	I respect people that know what they're doing, and these are the best in the world.
971	Donald Trump	I really do.
972	Donald Trump	These are the best in the world.
973	Donald Trump	And the pilot says, Sir, we're landing in approximately one and a half minutes."
974	Donald Trump	I say, "But there's no runway."
975	Donald Trump	No, sir, the runway is right up there, sir.
976	Donald Trump	I say, "I don't see it."
977	Donald Trump	I have pretty good vision.
978	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
979	Donald Trump	At least for my age I have good vision.
980	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
981	Donald Trump	I guess for my age I have great vision.
982	Donald Trump	But I don’t have vision like a 35-year-old captain.
983	Donald Trump	He said, "No, it's right up there."
984	Donald Trump	I said, "I'm sorry, Captain, how about this: Should we lift off and try it again?
985	Donald Trump	Captain, there's no runway."
986	Donald Trump	Anyway -- he sits right up there and we land.
987	Donald Trump	There's practically not lights.
988	Donald Trump	These are little pin spots. And I said, think of this: We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can't land with the lights on --
989	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
990	Donald Trump	-- 20 years later.
991	Donald Trump	How bad is it?
992	Donald Trump	No, seriously, how bad is it?
993	Donald Trump	How bad is it?
994	Donald Trump	Seven trillion dollars and we have to fly in with no lights.
995	Donald Trump	But I met some incredible people.
996	Donald Trump	I met some incredible people -- generals.
997	Donald Trump	One of them came from Syria -- the operation in Syria.
998	Donald Trump	And I was upset with my generals because they weren't getting it finished.
999	Donald Trump	I want the job done.
1000	Donald Trump	I want to bring our people back home.
1001	Donald Trump	It's not fair.
1002	Donald Trump	And this is why I flew.
1003	Donald Trump	So I met generals I didn't know.
1004	Donald Trump	General one, general two, general three.
1005	Donald Trump	I mean, these generals -- there's no person in Hollywood that could play the role.
1006	Donald Trump	These guys are like perfect people.
1007	Donald Trump	I said, "What's your name?
1008	Donald Trump	Sir, my name is Raisin.
1009	Donald Trump	What the hell kind of a name?
1010	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1011	Donald Trump	I said, "Raisin, like the fruit?"
1012	Donald Trump	He goes, "Yes, sir, Raisin."
1013	Donald Trump	What's your last name?
1014	Donald Trump	Caine.
1015	Donald Trump	Raisin Caine.
1016	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1017	Donald Trump	I said, "You got to be kidding me."
1018	Donald Trump	It's true.
1019	Donald Trump	Raisin Caine.
1020	Donald Trump	I just made him a big star.
1021	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1022	Donald Trump	Just like I did with Mattis when I said, "We're going to give you a new nickname, because 'Chaos' is not a good nickname."
1023	Donald Trump	So we changed his name.
1024	Donald Trump	Called him "Mad Dog."
1025	Donald Trump	But it wasn’t working too well.
1026	Donald Trump	Mad Dog wasn't working too well.
1027	Donald Trump	So what happened is I flew to Iraq.
1028	Donald Trump	I wanted to meet the people on the site, because I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what's going on, than I do from generals.
1029	Donald Trump	I do.
1030	Donald Trump	I hate to say it.
1031	Donald Trump	And I tell that to the generals all the time.
1032	Donald Trump	But I didn't have to go there.
1033	Donald Trump	I didn't have to go there.
1034	Donald Trump	Because I meet -- and I land in this airport, the most incredible thing.
1035	Donald Trump	We must have spent $3 billion building it.
1036	Donald Trump	It's one of the reasons I don't want to leave Iraq so fast.
1037	Donald Trump	I said, "Well, how do we leave this thing?"
1038	Donald Trump	So I have Raisin Caine and three other generals, colonels, sergeants.
1039	Donald Trump	And I said, "Bring the cameras.
1040	Donald Trump	I'm going to make a movie.
1041	Donald Trump	This is the most incredible thing."
1042	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1043	Donald Trump	And I said to the generals, "Listen, we got to get out.
1044	Donald Trump	I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent, which is what we had left."
1045	Donald Trump	It won't, sir.
1046	Donald Trump	And I said, "Tell me why it won't."
1047	Donald Trump	It won't, sir.
1048	Donald Trump	If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster.
1049	Donald Trump	Okay, General Raisin Caine, how fast can -- "Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week."
1050	Donald Trump	I said, "One week?
1051	Donald Trump	I was told two years."
1052	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1053	Donald Trump	One week?
1054	Donald Trump	That's right, sir.
1055	Donald Trump	We're only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria.
1056	Donald Trump	But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over -- from the base that you're right on, right now, sir.
1057	Donald Trump	They won't know what the hell hit them.
1058	Donald Trump	They won't know what the hell hit them, sir.
1059	Donald Trump	And I said, "Why didn't my other generals tell me that?
1060	Donald Trump	Why didn't they tell me that?"
1061	Donald Trump	I said, "Did you tell them that?"
1062	Donald Trump	Not our place to say it, sir.
1063	Donald Trump	They come in from Washington, sir.
1064	Donald Trump	We have to take orders.
1065	Donald Trump	You're the first one to ask us our opinion.
1066	Donald Trump	It's true.
1067	Donald Trump	It's true.
1068	Donald Trump	True.
1069	Donald Trump	True.
1070	Donald Trump	So I went back and I said, "I'm going to get back to you soon, Raisin.
1071	Donald Trump	I think you're great."
1072	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1073	Donald Trump	I like you, Raisin Caine.
1074	Donald Trump	But I did say -- I said, "Well, hey, listen, we're in Iraq.
1075	Donald Trump	Isn't that very far away from..." "I was here in a very short time, sir.
1076	Donald Trump	I flew right in."
1077	Donald Trump	Of course, he's taking a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, you know.
1078	Donald Trump	But incredible.
1079	Donald Trump	What you learn from being on the site -- my father was a builder.
1080	Donald Trump	He always used to say, "Nobody ever got rich by sitting behind their desk."
1081	Donald Trump	It's true.
1082	Donald Trump	It's true.
1083	Donald Trump	He'd say, "You got to be on this site.
1084	Donald Trump	You got to be with the contractors.
1085	Donald Trump	You got to see if they're ripping you off.
1086	Donald Trump	You've got to collect every nail that's dropped, every piece of wood.
1087	Donald Trump	You can sell it.
1088	Donald Trump	You got to be on the site.
1089	Donald Trump	You got to see while they're building, while they're under construction, is that wall straight or if it's crooked.
1090	Donald Trump	And you have to fix it before they build it, not after they build it, when you rip everything down."
1091	Donald Trump	True.
1092	Donald Trump	You don’t get rich by sitting behind a desk.
1093	Donald Trump	So I didn't want to do that.
1094	Donald Trump	And I'm in the White House and I was lonely.
1095	Donald Trump	I said, "Let's go to Iraq."
1096	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1097	Donald Trump	And I had a hell of a meeting in Iraq.
1098	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you, those generals -- not just Raisin Caine, General Caine.
1099	Donald Trump	Those generals were great.
1100	Donald Trump	They were great.
1101	Donald Trump	They knew their stuff.
1102	Donald Trump	They were gung-ho.
1103	Donald Trump	And it is true -- I mean, you talk central casting.
1104	Donald Trump	These guys -- you couldn’t -- I mean, it's incredible.
1105	Donald Trump	They had a master sergeant.
1106	Donald Trump	I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he's the star of the movie.
1107	Donald Trump	That happened once before, you know.
1108	Donald Trump	That did happen once before.
1109	Donald Trump	Remember?
1110	Donald Trump	They brought a man in -- a sergeant, a drill sergeant -- to teach some actor how to be a drill sergeant.
1111	Donald Trump	The drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn't.
1112	Donald Trump	That's because Hollywood discriminates against our people.
1113	Donald Trump	You know the movie I'm talking about, right?
1114	Donald Trump	What was that movie?
1115	Donald Trump	You know the movie.
1116	Donald Trump	But while we're making great strides, and our country is doing as well -- and maybe, in many ways, better than it's ever done before -- Democrat lawmakers are now embracing socialism.
1117	Donald Trump	They want to replace individual rights with total government domination.
1118	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
1119	Donald Trump	Just this week, more than 100 Democrats in Congress signed up for a socialist takeover of American healthcare.
1120	Donald Trump	Their radical government-run plan -- if you call it that -- would lead to colossal tax increases -- increases like you've never seen before -- and take away private coverage from over 180 million Americans.
1121	SYSTEM	[Audience calls out No]
1122	Donald Trump	And we have some great private coverage, and we've initiated some incredible plans, like the new cooperative plan, where you get better insurance than Obamacare for a fraction of the cost.
1123	Donald Trump	But perhaps nothing is more extreme than the Democrats' plan to completely takeover American energy and completely destroy America's economy through their new $100 trillion Green New Deal.
1124	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
1125	Donald Trump	Under the Green New Deal -- which somebody described as a high school term paper written by a poor student --
1126	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1127	Donald Trump	-- it's true.
1128	Donald Trump	It's true.
1129	Donald Trump	Who would believe it?
1130	Donald Trump	It so -- it's so bad.
1131	Donald Trump	But I don't -- I'll be honest with you, folks.
1132	Donald Trump	I said -- you know, it's Saturday morning, and I said, "Matt, should we do a little more, like, spend time?"
1133	Donald Trump	He said, "Yeah, would you do that?"
1134	Donald Trump	By the way, everybody okay?
1135	Donald Trump	I haven't seen anybody leaving.
1136	Donald Trump	I haven't seen anybody.
1137	Donald Trump	I know one thing: If Mark Levin gets up and leaves, I'll finish very quickly, because then I know.
1138	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1139	Donald Trump	But I haven't seen anyone leaving.
1140	Donald Trump	Nobody has left.
1141	Donald Trump	I watch those doors.
1142	Donald Trump	Because a lot of times -- a lot of times -- well, one time, the press said people left.
1143	Donald Trump	Yeah, you know where they went?
1144	Donald Trump	To the bathroom.
1145	Donald Trump	And then they came back.
1146	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1147	Donald Trump	Two people.
1148	Donald Trump	They showed two empty seats in a stadium of 19,000.
1149	Donald Trump	They showed two empty seats.
1150	Donald Trump	The people left right in front of me, and I said, "Oh, man, maybe this isn't a good job I'm doing."
1151	Donald Trump	Then they came back.
1152	Donald Trump	They went to the bathroom.
1153	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1154	Donald Trump	And a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats.
1155	Donald Trump	They said Trump had empty seats.
1156	Donald Trump	We never have empty seats.
1157	Donald Trump	The Green New Deal would completely abolish the American oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power industries, of which we're now the leader in the world.
1158	Donald Trump	We're the biggest now in the world because of moves that I've made.
1159	Donald Trump	Happened over the last two years, by the way.
1160	Donald Trump	And we're trying to speed up pipelines in Texas, which would have taken 15 years.
1161	Donald Trump	We think we're almost very close to getting them approved.
1162	Donald Trump	When that happens, we'll go probably another 30 to 40 percent.
1163	Donald Trump	We need pipeline approval.
1164	Donald Trump	We're going to have it very quickly.
1165	Donald Trump	It would have taken -- it was going to be a 14- to 15-year process.
1166	Donald Trump	We should have it done.
1167	Donald Trump	We'll pick up 30 to 40 percent more.
1168	Donald Trump	Their plan would remove every gas-powered car from American roads.
1169	Donald Trump	Oh, that's not so bad.
1170	Donald Trump	They want you to have one car instead of two, and it should be electric, okay?
1171	Donald Trump	So tell people, no more cars.
1172	Donald Trump	No more cars.
1173	Donald Trump	I think the auto industry is not going to do too well under this plan.
1174	Donald Trump	What do you think, Meadows?
1175	Donald Trump	How is this?
1176	Donald Trump	Will the auto industry be good?
1177	Donald Trump	I don’t think so.
1178	Donald Trump	It's not looking good.
1179	Donald Trump	I think maybe -- maybe you're going to see some bad stock prices if that passes.
1180	Donald Trump	It would end air travel.
1181	Donald Trump	But you'll get on a train, don't worry about it.
1182	Donald Trump	You just have to cross off about 95 percent of the world.
1183	Donald Trump	And it would force the destruction or renovation of virtually every existing structure in the United States.
1184	Donald Trump	New York City would have to rip down buildings and rebuild them again.
1185	Donald Trump	I don't think so.
1186	Donald Trump	This is the craziest plan, and yet I see senators that are there for 20 years -- white hair.
1187	Donald Trump	See, I don't have white hair.
1188	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1189	Donald Trump	I don’t have white hair.
1190	Donald Trump	No, I see these white-haired, longtime senators standing behind this young woman, and she's ranting and raving like a lunatic.
1191	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1192	Donald Trump	And these senators -- these senators: "Yes, I agree with this.
1193	Donald Trump	Yes, I agree."
1194	Donald Trump	The crazy female senator from the state of Ohio, the state of Hawaii.
1195	Donald Trump	Right?
1196	Donald Trump	She's like -- she's like a crazed person.
1197	Donald Trump	What she said about men is so bad.
1198	Donald Trump	What she said about men is so bad.
1199	Donald Trump	But she's standing in the hallway.
1200	Donald Trump	And she didn't know too much about the plan because she's -- you know, she can't understand that plan.
1201	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1202	Donald Trump	Which probably makes her smart, actually.
1203	Donald Trump	Now, this is the senator from Hawaii, and they're saying to her, "What do you think?
1204	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know how people are going to get to Hawaii, but I'm in favor of the plan."
1205	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1206	Donald Trump	I don't get it.
1207	Donald Trump	I don't get it.
1208	Donald Trump	I don't get it.
1209	Donald Trump	So she's in favor of the plan, but you won't be able to get to -- well, we can take boats, I guess.
1210	Donald Trump	We'll go back to boats.
1211	Donald Trump	This is the new Democrat platform for the -- and I don't want to talk them out of it.
1212	Donald Trump	I don't.
1213	Donald Trump	I don't.
1214	Donald Trump	I swear I don't.
1215	Donald Trump	This is a killer.
1216	Donald Trump	I got to get off this subject.
1217	Donald Trump	I want them to embrace this plan.
1218	Donald Trump	I want them to go and sell this plan.
1219	Donald Trump	I just want to be the Republican that runs against them for that.
1220	Donald Trump	I'm going to regret this speech.
1221	Donald Trump	This speech should have been delivered one year from now, not now, damn it.
1222	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1223	Donald Trump	Because they're going to grab out together, and they're going to say, "You know, this guy is really laying for us."
1224	Donald Trump	I should've saved the Pocahontas thing for another year.
1225	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1226	Donald Trump	Because I've destroyed her political career, and now I won't get a chance to run against her, and I would’ve loved it.
1227	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1228	Donald Trump	We got to -- you know, I don't want to knock out all of the good stuff and end up with somebody that's actually got talent.
1229	Donald Trump	That would be terrible.
1230	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1231	Donald Trump	So I do like the Green New Deal.
1232	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1233	Donald Trump	I respect it greatly.
1234	Donald Trump	It should be part of the dialogue of the next election.
1235	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1236	Donald Trump	And I think it has tremendous promise and tremendous potential for the future of our country.
1237	Donald Trump	Socialism is not about the environment.
1238	Donald Trump	It's not about justice.
1239	Donald Trump	It's not about virtue.
1240	Donald Trump	Socialism is about only one thing.
1241	Donald Trump	It's called "power for the ruling class."
1242	Donald Trump	That's what it is.
1243	Donald Trump	Look at what's happening in Venezuela and so many other places.
1244	Donald Trump	All of us are here today because we know that the future does not belong to those who believe in socialism.
1245	Donald Trump	And I heard, yesterday, a great speech from our Vice President Mike Pence, talking about this very subject -- and talking about it beautifully.
1246	Donald Trump	The future belongs to those who believe in freedom.
1247	Donald Trump	I have said it before and I'll say it again: America will never be a socialist country -- ever.
1248	SYSTEM	[Audience Chants USA]
1249	Donald Trump	Young Americans -- I love young Americans.
1250	Donald Trump	Speaking of young Americans -- Candace, stand up.
1251	Donald Trump	Candace is getting married.
1252	Donald Trump	Stand up.
1253	Donald Trump	You've been incredible.
1254	Donald Trump	Thank you.
1255	Donald Trump	Your whole group has been great.
1256	Donald Trump	You're getting married.
1257	Donald Trump	Seems like a nice guy to me.
1258	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1259	Donald Trump	Congratulations.
1260	Donald Trump	You've been so great.
1261	Donald Trump	Thank you very much, Candace.
1262	Donald Trump	Thanks.
1263	Donald Trump	And, Charlie, what a job you're doing.
1264	Donald Trump	Where's Charlie?
1265	Donald Trump	Where's Charlie?
1266	Donald Trump	Where is Charlie Kirk?
1267	Donald Trump	Because he has done an incredible job.
1268	Donald Trump	Thank you very much, Charlie.
1269	Donald Trump	But young Americans like you are leading the revival of American liberty, sovereignty, and self-determination in the face of left-wing intolerance.
1270	Donald Trump	The anger -- the unbelievable anger -- I see it every day.
1271	Donald Trump	Fortunately, for you, it's mostly pointed at me.
1272	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1273	Donald Trump	You have the courage to speak the truth, to do what is right, and to fight for what you believe, and keep doing it.
1274	Donald Trump	We reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas.
1275	Donald Trump	These ideas are dangerous.
1276	Donald Trump	Instead, we believe in free speech, including online and including on campus.
1277	Donald Trump	And, by the way, there's a young gentleman with us today.
1278	Donald Trump	There's a young gentleman.
1279	Donald Trump	I turned on my television the other day, and I saw somebody that was violently punched in the face.
1280	Donald Trump	Violently punched.
1281	Donald Trump	And I said that's disgusting.
1282	Donald Trump	By a bully I'd like to do a lot of things.
1283	Donald Trump	But, of course, we would never do that.
1284	Donald Trump	Because if I ever said violence, they would say, "Donald Trump attacked."
1285	Donald Trump	No, no, no.
1286	Donald Trump	Just for the media: I'm sure he's a lovely young man; just had a little temper tantrum.
1287	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1288	Donald Trump	I've been there before with those people.
1289	Donald Trump	I don’t want to do it again.
1290	Donald Trump	So, the man's name is Hayden Williams.
1291	Donald Trump	Where's Hayden?
1292	Donald Trump	Where is he?
1293	Donald Trump	Where is he?
1294	Donald Trump	Hayden, come up here.
1295	Donald Trump	Come up here.
1296	Hayden Williams	Thank you.
1297	Hayden Williams	Thank you.
1298	Hayden Williams	So, at the Leadership Institute, we're committed to making campuses great again.
1299	Hayden Williams	And I thank you so much for bringing me up here to let me speak.
1300	Hayden Williams	It's great -- it's great that I'm being recognized, and -- but there's so many conservative students across the country who are facing discrimination, harassment, and worse, if they dare to speak up on campus.
1301	Hayden Williams	So I'm glad that we could -- we could, you know, bring this to the forefront.
1302	Hayden Williams	And I'd just like to say, you know, if these socialist progressives had their way, they would put our Constitution through the paper shredder in a heartbeat.
1303	Hayden Williams	So, you know, it's as important now than ever the work at Leadership Institute and Campus Reform -- you know, exposing these liberal abuses to the public -- it's as important now as ever.
1304	Hayden Williams	And these students -- these students do it because they have a love of our nation and freedom, and frankly, a love for you, Mr. President.
1305	Hayden Williams	So if you keep defending us, we'll keep defending you.
1306	Donald Trump	Thank you.
1307	Hayden Williams	Thank you.
1308	Donald Trump	Stay here for a second.
1309	Donald Trump	So, here's the one thing.
1310	Donald Trump	I was going to call him, but I don't have to now.
1311	Donald Trump	I see him here.
1312	Donald Trump	But here's the one thing: I learned a number of things.
1313	Donald Trump	First of all, he can take a punch.
1314	Donald Trump	If Muhammad Ali could take a punch, he can take a punch.
1315	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1316	Donald Trump	Because you weren’t going to go down no matter how -- that was a hell of a hard punch.
1317	Donald Trump	He was a strong guy.
1318	Donald Trump	But you know what?
1319	Donald Trump	You've got yourself a great lawyer.
1320	Donald Trump	I know your lawyer.
1321	Donald Trump	She is a great lawyer.
1322	Donald Trump	Just tell her to do me a favor: Sue him.
1323	Donald Trump	But he's probably got nothing, but sue him forever.
1324	Donald Trump	But sue the college, the university.
1325	Donald Trump	And maybe sue the state.
1326	Donald Trump	Ladies and gentlemen, he took a hard punch in the face for all of us.
1327	Donald Trump	Remember that.
1328	Donald Trump	He took a punch for all of us.
1329	Donald Trump	And we can never allow that to happen.
1330	Donald Trump	And here is, in closing with Hayden -- here's the good news: He is going to be a very wealthy young man.
1331	Donald Trump	That's okay.
1332	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1333	Donald Trump	Go get 'em, Hayden.
1334	Donald Trump	Today I'm proud to announce that I will be very soon signing an executive order requiring colleges and universities to support free speech -- if they want federal research dollars.
1335	SYSTEM	[Audience Chants USA]
1336	Donald Trump	If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people, and old people, to speak.
1337	Donald Trump	Free speech.
1338	Donald Trump	And if they don't, it will be very costly.
1339	Donald Trump	That'll be signed very soon.
1340	Donald Trump	Every day, we're restoring common sense and the timeless values that unite us all.
1341	Donald Trump	We believe in the Constitution and the rule of law.
1342	Donald Trump	We believe in the First Amendment right.
1343	Donald Trump	And we believe in religious liberty.
1344	Donald Trump	And we believe strongly in the Second Amendment and the right to keep and bear arms -- which is under siege, folks.
1345	Donald Trump	They have a lot of plans.
1346	Donald Trump	It's under siege.
1347	Donald Trump	Be careful.
1348	Donald Trump	But I'll protect you, I promise you that.
1349	Donald Trump	I'll protect you.
1350	Donald Trump	Because it all has to come through my office.
1351	Donald Trump	And we hopefully are going to be here for six more years, so you're in good shape.
1352	Donald Trump	We believe in the American Dream, not in the socialist nightmare.
1353	Donald Trump	And we believe in the words of our national motto: In God We Trust.
1354	Donald Trump	Every day, my presidency will defend American families.
1355	Donald Trump	We will defend America's workers -- our great, great cherished workers -- that now we're taking care of.
1356	Donald Trump	They're not losing their jobs.
1357	Donald Trump	We're creating those jobs.
1358	Donald Trump	We're not letting those companies destroy their lives anymore.
1359	Donald Trump	We will defend the American way of life, and we will always defend America's borders.
1360	Donald Trump	Because without borders, as I've said many times before, we don't have a country.
1361	Donald Trump	The lawless chaos on our southern border provides a lucrative cash flow to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet.
1362	Donald Trump	Deadly cartels constantly -- daily, hourly -- violate our borders to flood our cities with drugs that kill thousands and thousands of our citizens violently.
1363	Donald Trump	What are these people talking about when they talk about the border?
1364	Donald Trump	Keep it open.
1365	Donald Trump	Keep what open?
1366	Donald Trump	Have you been there?
1367	Donald Trump	Have you seen?
1368	Donald Trump	I just got back.
1369	Donald Trump	I've been there many times.
1370	Donald Trump	I see what's happening.
1371	Donald Trump	I don't like it.
1372	Donald Trump	But I have to tell you, our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our law enforcement, the job they do -- and they don't have the backup of a wall, in many cases -- the job they do is incredible.
1373	Donald Trump	These ruthless cartels terrorize innocent communities on both sides of the border and spread instability throughout our hemisphere.
1374	Donald Trump	When I was there two weeks ago, 26 people were killed very close to where I was, on the Rio Grande.
1375	Donald Trump	Sounds nice, right?
1376	Donald Trump	The Rio Grande.
1377	Donald Trump	Rough.
1378	Donald Trump	Rough stuff.
1379	Donald Trump	Twenty-six people were killed, and they were buried right near where I was standing.
1380	Donald Trump	And the paper doesn't write about it.
1381	Donald Trump	The news doesn't write about it.
1382	Donald Trump	In the last two years alone, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests.
1383	Donald Trump	Think of what that means.
1384	Donald Trump	Think of that -- arrests.
1385	Donald Trump	I'm not talking about people coming in.
1386	Donald Trump	I'm talking they went out and arrested 266,000 people who have criminal records and, in some cases, for murder.
1387	Donald Trump	Who the hell wants to do that?
1388	Donald Trump	Thank God they're doing it because I don't want to do it.
1389	Donald Trump	It's dangerous.
1390	Donald Trump	It's hard.
1391	Donald Trump	But they love our country, and they're tough people, but they love our country.
1392	Donald Trump	Including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 violent murders.
1393	Donald Trump	These are people that ICE is going in and getting, and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put in jail, because we don’t want them.
1394	Donald Trump	We don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years.
1395	Donald Trump	You want them to pay a price, but we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years.
1396	Donald Trump	And all the nonsense you hear about "the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have" -- it's not true, folks.
1397	Donald Trump	Okay?
1398	Donald Trump	It's false.
1399	Donald Trump	It's false propaganda.
1400	Donald Trump	Right?
1401	Donald Trump	One recent study from FAIR -- F-A-I-R -- found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents.
1402	Donald Trump	Those are the numbers.
1403	Donald Trump	And if you look at prison population in federal prisons, these federal prisons are -- the number is staggering.
1404	Donald Trump	The number of illegals -- far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population.
1405	Donald Trump	But you don't hear that; you hear like these people are the greatest people in the world.
1406	Donald Trump	Just ask the Angel Moms how good are there.
1407	Donald Trump	Those great Angel Moms who were treated so badly -- so badly.
1408	Donald Trump	Incredible people.
1409	Donald Trump	But the simple reality is that every crime committed by an illegal immigrant is a crime that should never have happened in the first place.
1410	Donald Trump	The border crisis is also a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy.
1411	Donald Trump	Vicious coyotes, smugglers, and human traffickers prey upon innocent women and children.
1412	Donald Trump	One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north.
1413	Donald Trump	When I ran for president, my first speech, I mentioned the word "rape."
1414	Donald Trump	The press went after me; I couldn't believe it.
1415	Donald Trump	I said, "Will it be like this always?"
1416	Donald Trump	The answer was yes.
1417	Donald Trump	It even got worse.
1418	Donald Trump	From day one, I mention the word "rape."
1419	Donald Trump	If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening.
1420	Donald Trump	That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts.
1421	Donald Trump	Illegal immigration is not compassionate.
1422	Donald Trump	It's inhumane, unjust, and cruel.
1423	Donald Trump	The media fights me on this, but I say it: Mothers who love their daughters, when their daughters are getting ready to make that 2,000-mile trek up through Mexico -- and frankly, I wish Mexico would stop them at their northern border, at our -- I wish Mexico would stop them.
1424	Donald Trump	Because you know, they have a border.
1425	Donald Trump	They call it their southern border.
1426	Donald Trump	It's 2,000 miles down from our southern border.
1427	Donald Trump	I wish Mexico would stop them.
1428	Donald Trump	But they have their own difficulties.
1429	Donald Trump	Frankly, I understand that.
1430	Donald Trump	We're working along well with them.
1431	Donald Trump	And they are doing a lot of things to help us with asylum and other elements of what we're doing.
1432	Donald Trump	But mothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border.
1433	Donald Trump	Think of that.
1434	Donald Trump	True story, told to me by the Border Patrol.
1435	Donald Trump	So true and so sad.
1436	Donald Trump	Think of how evil that is.
1437	Donald Trump	Think of how bad it is.
1438	Donald Trump	Those caravans -- you look at those caravans, and some are phenomenal people.
1439	Donald Trump	But in those caravans you have stone-cold killers.
1440	Donald Trump	You had the interview done by some innocent person who I think is actually back there now.
1441	Donald Trump	And what is it that you want asylum for?
1442	Donald Trump	Why are you coming to America?
1443	Donald Trump	Uh, murder.
1444	Donald Trump	She goes, "What?"
1445	Donald Trump	Murder.
1446	Donald Trump	I mean, what's going on is incredible.
1447	Donald Trump	And when those caravans are formed, do you think those countries that we used to give a lot of money to -- I've cut it way back.
1448	Donald Trump	I've cut it way back.
1449	Donald Trump	Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.
1450	Donald Trump	Do you think they're giving us, as we say, their best and their finest?
1451	Donald Trump	Oh, let's send our best people up to America.
1452	Donald Trump	Let's have our best people go in the caravan so we can give America our greatest people.
1453	Donald Trump	No, no, no, no.
1454	Donald Trump	They give us some very bad people.
1455	Donald Trump	People with big, long crime records.
1456	Donald Trump	People with tremendous violence in their past.
1457	Donald Trump	Murderers, killers, drug dealers, human traffickers.
1458	Donald Trump	They want to keep their good people because they're smart.
1459	Donald Trump	It's so sad to see how stupid we've been.
1460	Donald Trump	Border Patrol recently reported apprehending 7,000 unlawful migrants in a single week on just one part of the Texas border, a couple of weeks ago.
1461	Donald Trump	Our immigration system is stretched far beyond the breaking point.
1462	Donald Trump	To confront this national security crisis, last month I declared a national emergency.
1463	Donald Trump	A national emergency.
1464	Donald Trump	And when I see these people -- and they're good people -- some senators, mostly -- I tell you, the House has been fantastic.
1465	Donald Trump	The House -- you know, backing we've had from the House has really been -- I'm talking about in the last short period of time.
1466	Donald Trump	There's a lot of spirit in the House, and I think in the Senate too, but we're going to have to see because we have a vote coming up.
1467	Donald Trump	And a lot of people talk about precedent.
1468	Donald Trump	Precedent.
1469	Donald Trump	That if we do this, the Democrats will use national emergency powers for something that we don't want.
1470	Donald Trump	They're going to do that anyway, folks.
1471	Donald Trump	The best way to stop that is to make sure that I win the election.
1472	Donald Trump	That's the best way to stop that.
1473	Donald Trump	They're going to do it anyway.
1474	Donald Trump	They'll do it anyway.
1475	Donald Trump	I watch -- good people, they're friends of mine, "We're very concerned with setting precedent."
1476	Donald Trump	That's "precedent" not "president."
1477	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1478	Donald Trump	Precedent.
1479	Donald Trump	We're very concerned about setting precedent.
1480	Donald Trump	I'm very concerned with having murderers and drug traffickers, and drugs and drug cartels, pouring into our country.
1481	Donald Trump	That's what I'm concerned about.
1482	Donald Trump	And the Democrats, they're going to do whatever they do if they get into power, and it won't have a damn thing to do with whether or not we approve our national emergency.
1483	Donald Trump	Because let me tell you -- they don't like it when I say it -- but we are being invaded.
1484	Donald Trump	We're being invaded by drugs, by people, by criminals.
1485	Donald Trump	And we have to stop it.
1486	Donald Trump	And we want people to come in, as I said before, but they have to come in legally and with merit.
1487	Donald Trump	Previous presidents have used their national emergency power to promote democratic elections in Belarus, to ensure political stability in Burundi, and to defend the sovereignty of Lebanon.
1488	Donald Trump	And you know what?
1489	Donald Trump	That's okay.
1490	Donald Trump	In Lebanon -- it's good.
1491	Donald Trump	Fine.
1492	Donald Trump	Use it.
1493	Donald Trump	But we need it right here in our country.
1494	Donald Trump	We have to use it for our country.
1495	Donald Trump	Many emergency declarations have been used to protect people in faraway nations and distant lands.
1496	Donald Trump	Now we are protecting, finally, our people.
1497	Donald Trump	You.
1498	Donald Trump	Our people.
1499	Donald Trump	And we are proudly standing with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.
1500	Donald Trump	Illegal immigration is also deeply unfair to American workers and taxpayers, including millions and millions of hardworking legal immigrants.
1501	Donald Trump	If you care about helping immigrants and care about their success, if you care about reducing poverty and raising living standards, then you must support a safe, strong, and very, very secure border.
1502	Donald Trump	We need an immigration policy that helps all Americans thrive, flourish, prosper.
1503	Donald Trump	We need an immigration policy that's going to be great for our corporations and our great companies.
1504	Donald Trump	We need an immigration policy where people coming into our country can love our country and love our fellow citizens.
1505	Donald Trump	And this includes shutting down sanctuary cities.
1506	Donald Trump	And we want to end catch-and-release.
1507	Donald Trump	We catch them, we realize they're a criminal, and we have to release them.
1508	Donald Trump	Think of this: They come onto our land, they put one foot on our land.
1509	Donald Trump	We now have to take them through a massive court trial.
1510	Donald Trump	Who does this?
1511	Donald Trump	Other countries say, "Get the hell out of here."
1512	Donald Trump	We have to take them through court.
1513	Donald Trump	So we catch them.
1514	Donald Trump	We talk to them.
1515	Donald Trump	If they're criminals, or if they're not, we release them.
1516	Donald Trump	We say, "Come back for a hearing in front of a judge."
1517	Donald Trump	You know how many judges you need to do this?
1518	Donald Trump	We have 900,000 people backlogged.
1519	Donald Trump	That's the good news.
1520	Donald Trump	The bad news?
1521	Donald Trump	Nobody shows up.
1522	Donald Trump	Three percent of the people come back for a trial.
1523	Donald Trump	It's insane.
1524	Donald Trump	Not my fault I inherited this mess, but we're fixing it.
1525	Donald Trump	We have to end chain migration, and we have to cancel the visa lottery.
1526	Donald Trump	Every American, no matter where they're born, will benefit from the creation of a lawful immigration system.
1527	Donald Trump	It is such -- you talk about an emergency.
1528	Donald Trump	Our immigration system is so broken, folks.
1529	Donald Trump	It's so broken.
1530	Donald Trump	It's so sad to see.
1531	Donald Trump	It's incompetent.
1532	Donald Trump	It's laughed at all over the world.
1533	Donald Trump	We have people pouring in from not just the southern border in Mexico.
1534	Donald Trump	From China.
1535	Donald Trump	They have a baby on our land.
1536	Donald Trump	The baby becomes a citizen.
1537	Donald Trump	Welcome to the United States for hopefully 90 years.
1538	Donald Trump	Okay?
1539	Donald Trump	And then the parents come in with the baby because the baby is a citizen.
1540	Donald Trump	This is like crazy.
1541	Donald Trump	They used to call it "anchor babies" but they don't use that term anymore because it doesn't sound nice.
1542	Donald Trump	Our laws are so crazy.
1543	Donald Trump	But one by one, we're finding ways.
1544	Donald Trump	You know, they call them loopholes.
1545	Donald Trump	A lot of our laws -- loopholes.
1546	Donald Trump	Well, I'm finding loopholes to get around the loophole.
1547	Donald Trump	Okay?
1548	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1549	Donald Trump	Because our Congress can't act.
1550	Donald Trump	They can't act.
1551	Donald Trump	They just can't act.
1552	Donald Trump	The Democrats in Congress don't want to touch any of it.
1553	Donald Trump	Visa lottery -- that's where they put in the names; they put it in a lottery, and you pick, "Oh, here's a wonderful person.
1554	Donald Trump	Wonderful."
1555	Donald Trump	You know, he killed four people.
1556	Donald Trump	Here's -- here's another wonderful.
1557	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1558	Donald Trump	And then they get in and we say, "Gee, that person just came into our country.
1559	Donald Trump	He just robbed a store and killed somebody."
1560	Donald Trump	How is that possible?
1561	Donald Trump	Because they send us the people they don't want.
1562	Donald Trump	The biggest form of subsidy we give to other nations.
1563	Donald Trump	Immigration systems that prioritize the admission of those who can support themselves financially and contribute.
1564	Donald Trump	We want people that can help themselves, that can support themselves.
1565	Donald Trump	We have people coming in.
1566	Donald Trump	We support them from the day they come in until the day they die.
1567	Donald Trump	We can't do that as a country.
1568	Donald Trump	We can't afford to do that as a country.
1569	Donald Trump	Sadly, on immigration and so many other issues, Democrat lawmakers have totally abandoned the American mainstream.
1570	Donald Trump	But that's going to be good for us in 2020.
1571	Donald Trump	They're embracing open borders, socialism, and extreme late-term abortion.
1572	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
1573	Donald Trump	Weeks ago, lawmakers in New York cheered as they passed legislation to allow babies to be ripped from the womb of their mother right up to the very moment of death.
1574	Donald Trump	Then, in an act and a statement, the likes of which I don't think I've ever heard, in Virginia, the governor -- a Democrat -- stated that he would allow babies to be born, to be born outside.
1575	Donald Trump	He would wrap them.
1576	Donald Trump	He would take care of them.
1577	Donald Trump	And then he'll talk to the mother and the father as to what to be done.
1578	Donald Trump	And if they didn't want the child, who is now outside of the womb -- long outside of the womb -- they will execute the baby after birth.
1579	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
1580	Donald Trump	They will execute the baby after birth.
1581	Donald Trump	And that's one many people have never even heard of or thought about.
1582	Donald Trump	This is a radical agenda by the Democrats.
1583	Donald Trump	And when you put something up, as was just put up before the Senate, everybody on the Democrat side votes for it.
1584	Donald Trump	By the way, I have to say one thing: They're lousy politicians and they have lousy policy.
1585	Donald Trump	They have policy I could never sell if I wanted to.
1586	Donald Trump	But -- but -- big but -- they always stick together.
1587	Donald Trump	And the Republicans don't remember that.
1588	Donald Trump	Remember that.
1589	Donald Trump	They always stick together.
1590	Donald Trump	They vote in blocs.
1591	Donald Trump	They have 47.
1592	Donald Trump	We had a tremendous victory.
1593	Donald Trump	We were given no credit.
1594	Donald Trump	I can't go and campaign for all of the people in the House.
1595	Donald Trump	Too many.
1596	Donald Trump	And guys like Meadows wins by so many points he doesn't need any help.
1597	Donald Trump	He doesn't need it.
1598	Donald Trump	I say, "Mark, do you need any help?"
1599	Donald Trump	No, I'm okay.
1600	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1601	Donald Trump	He'll win by 30, 35.
1602	Donald Trump	They're okay.
1603	Donald Trump	These guys -- you know a funny thing?
1604	Donald Trump	The ones that love Trump, the ones that are really the Trumpers -- like Meadows, Jordan, Gates, so many of them.
1605	Donald Trump	I don’t want to -- I could just name so many.
1606	Donald Trump	They're the ones that win with that.
1607	Donald Trump	I mean, it's like they don't even have an election.
1608	Donald Trump	It's the ones that sort of -- they're a little shy about embracing what we're all about, they get clobbered.
1609	Donald Trump	They get clobbered.
1610	Donald Trump	Take a look.
1611	Donald Trump	Those are the ones that get clobbered.
1612	Donald Trump	But the good news is they're all starting to find that out.
1613	Donald Trump	Just this week, Senate Democrats opposed legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children who survive abortions.
1614	Donald Trump	Virtually every Democrat voted against protecting these precious babies.
1615	Donald Trump	Every one.
1616	Donald Trump	They vote in groups.
1617	Donald Trump	And we did have that great victory.
1618	Donald Trump	We won for 51.
1619	Donald Trump	And two that we didn't like got out.
1620	Donald Trump	They said they retired.
1621	Donald Trump	They didn't retire.
1622	Donald Trump	They were retired.
1623	Donald Trump	They said, "These two senators have decided to retire."
1624	Donald Trump	No, no, no.
1625	Donald Trump	They retired because they had like very little support.
1626	Donald Trump	Like how about 5 percent?
1627	Donald Trump	Any percent.
1628	Donald Trump	No, we did great.
1629	Donald Trump	We had 53 we picked up in the Senate.
1630	Donald Trump	They were going to win the Senate, remember?
1631	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you, folks, I worked hard.
1632	Donald Trump	I did 32 big, fat rallies.
1633	Donald Trump	And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals.
1634	Donald Trump	And the fake news back there, they love to say "Donald Trump suffered a big defeat."
1635	Donald Trump	First of all, we won the Senate, which, frankly, judges -- you know, I hate to say it: In all due respect for us, the Senate, far more important.
1636	Donald Trump	I really worked hard.
1637	Donald Trump	But think of it.
1638	Donald Trump	We won the Senate and we had this, like, tremendous victory.
1639	Donald Trump	We get no credit at all.
1640	Donald Trump	Wait until you see what happens.
1641	Donald Trump	They say, "Donald Trump suffered a humiliating defeat."
1642	Donald Trump	I said, "I wasn't running."
1643	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1644	Donald Trump	And one of the commentators -- and I appreciate it -- one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, "Excuse me, he didn't run."
1645	Donald Trump	You know, not all our candidates were exactly great.
1646	Donald Trump	Let's face it.
1647	Donald Trump	You know, you can only do so much.
1648	Donald Trump	But wait until you see what's happening when I do run.
1649	Donald Trump	And what they don't say is -- governor of Ohio, great guy.
1650	Donald Trump	Mike.
1651	Donald Trump	Mike.
1652	Donald Trump	Mike was down six.
1653	Donald Trump	He won by seven with one day.
1654	Donald Trump	Right?
1655	Donald Trump	He was down by six.
1656	Donald Trump	One day into the election, I went out, I campaigned, worked hard, made a speech.
1657	Donald Trump	Jim Jordan was there.
1658	Donald Trump	Everybody was there.
1659	Donald Trump	It was a fantastic crowd like this.
1660	Donald Trump	Like this.
1661	Donald Trump	And all the people in the other ballrooms that are waiting for us.
1662	Donald Trump	And he ended up winning.
1663	Donald Trump	He was down by six; he won by seven.
1664	Donald Trump	One day.
1665	Donald Trump	Then we have Georgia -- the governor of Georgia.
1666	Donald Trump	Great guy.
1667	Donald Trump	Where's Georgia?
1668	Donald Trump	Great guy.
1669	Donald Trump	He was losing in the primary by 10.
1670	Donald Trump	I got a call from David Perdue and Sonny Perdue -- two great guys.
1671	Donald Trump	Could you endorse him?
1672	Donald Trump	I said, "Let me check."
1673	Donald Trump	And I checked him.
1674	Donald Trump	He was a Trumper before Trump was a Trumper.
1675	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1676	Donald Trump	And I said, "I love this guy."
1677	Donald Trump	He's down by 10.
1678	Donald Trump	He won by 40.
1679	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?
1680	Donald Trump	I endorsed him, Mark.
1681	Donald Trump	He won by 40.
1682	Donald Trump	Then he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party -- not Democratic.
1683	Donald Trump	It's Democrat.
1684	Donald Trump	We have to do that.
1685	Donald Trump	You know, it sounds prettier when we use "Democratic."
1686	Donald Trump	I even like -- I hate to say in the speech, the "Democrat Party" because it doesn't sound good.
1687	Donald Trump	But that's all the more reason I use it, because it doesn't.
1688	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1689	Donald Trump	They should change it because it sounds much better.
1690	Donald Trump	Rhetorically, it's much better.
1691	Donald Trump	Much better.
1692	Donald Trump	But then, he had an election against their star who followed me after the State of the Union Address.
1693	Donald Trump	I didn't think she was great.
1694	Donald Trump	But she's their star.
1695	Donald Trump	And who showed up?
1696	Donald Trump	Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and President Obama.
1697	SYSTEM	[Audience Boos]
1698	Donald Trump	And they campaigned for her, and they worked so hard.
1699	Donald Trump	And all our man had was Trump.
1700	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1701	Donald Trump	And we kicked their ass.
1702	Donald Trump	True.
1703	Donald Trump	We had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport.
1704	Donald Trump	It was one hangar.
1705	Donald Trump	They had three other hangars that were full.
1706	Donald Trump	They went so far back.
1707	Donald Trump	The problem was they gave the press, like these guys -- they gave the press too good a location because the people behind them couldn't see properly.
1708	Donald Trump	I was so angry.
1709	Donald Trump	But we had 55,000 people show up.
1710	Donald Trump	I said, "You're going to win the election."
1711	Donald Trump	He won the election.
1712	Donald Trump	He won it fairly easily, against their star.
1713	Donald Trump	And now David Perdue is going to win for senator in 2020.
1714	Donald Trump	And then -- and then we had Florida, and many others.
1715	Donald Trump	And we have a candidate, Ron DeSantis -- a friend.
1716	Donald Trump	A friend of many of us in this room.
1717	Donald Trump	But nobody knew he was running.
1718	Donald Trump	He was running against, in the primary, somebody that was easily going to win.
1719	Donald Trump	He was scheduled to be the next governor of Florida.
1720	Donald Trump	But Ron has been great to me on the witch hunt.
1721	Donald Trump	He's been a defender of me against these phony charges of Russia.
1722	Donald Trump	Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.
1723	Donald Trump	My wife said, "You never spoke to anybody from Russia, darling."
1724	Donald Trump	I said, "That's right."
1725	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1726	Donald Trump	But Ron DeSantis -- I like people that defend me.
1727	Donald Trump	You know, when people defend me, I defend them.
1728	Donald Trump	So he came.
1729	Donald Trump	That's why I like Mark.
1730	Donald Trump	That's why I like Mark Levin.
1731	Donald Trump	And I'm not sure a lot of people like him.
1732	Donald Trump	He's tough as hell.
1733	Donald Trump	But I like him.
1734	Donald Trump	I love him.
1735	Donald Trump	But then we have Florida.
1736	Donald Trump	So, Ron DeSantis is at three.
1737	Donald Trump	Three.
1738	Donald Trump	He calls up, "Sir, can I have your endorsement?"
1739	Donald Trump	I said, "Ron, you're at three.
1740	Donald Trump	Your opponent is, I guess, agriculture commissioner -- has 22 million in the bank.
1741	Donald Trump	His poll numbers are very good.
1742	Donald Trump	He's up in the 20s or 30s."
1743	Donald Trump	I said, "Ron, don't make me do this, Ron."
1744	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1745	Donald Trump	Sir, I can win.
1746	Donald Trump	All right, Ron.
1747	Donald Trump	Here we go.
1748	Donald Trump	Because I know if he loses -- which almost never happens when I endorse somebody.
1749	Donald Trump	Almost never.
1750	Donald Trump	Only one time, and that was because it was done in the middle of the day of the election.
1751	Donald Trump	Nobody knew I did it.
1752	Donald Trump	They got home, they said, "I didn't know Trump endorsed him."
1753	Donald Trump	But we rarely, rarely lose.
1754	Donald Trump	But I said, "Ron, don't do it."
1755	Donald Trump	I said, "All right, I'll do it."
1756	Donald Trump	He went from 3 to 60.
1757	Donald Trump	To 60.
1758	Donald Trump	And then he ran against a guy who had unbelievable support.
1759	Donald Trump	He had every celebrity go into Florida.
1760	Donald Trump	He had money all over the place.
1761	Donald Trump	And Ron was in there pitching, and I was in there pitching with him.
1762	Donald Trump	And we now have a great governor in the state of Florida.
1763	Donald Trump	And I could mention many others -- other governors, many other states.
1764	Donald Trump	But I'm not going to bore you with it.
1765	Donald Trump	And I think -- I really think that it's incredible what we did in the midterms.
1766	Donald Trump	I think it's incredible.
1767	Donald Trump	Governor of Florida.
1768	Donald Trump	Governor of Ohio.
1769	Donald Trump	Remember, "You can't win unless you win the state of Ohio."
1770	Donald Trump	We got the governor of Ohio, and he's great.
1771	Donald Trump	Mike.
1772	Donald Trump	We love you, Mike.
1773	Donald Trump	As we defend American values at home, we are also defending.
1774	Donald Trump	American security abroad.
1775	Donald Trump	We have secured all sorts of funding, all sorts of record everything.
1776	Donald Trump	And we will never forget our military.
1777	Donald Trump	We will never forget our veterans.
1778	Donald Trump	We are taking care of our veterans like they've never been taken care of before.
1779	Donald Trump	We just got them Choice, so now they can go see a doctor.
1780	Donald Trump	Now they can go and see a doctor instead of waiting on line for weeks and weeks and weeks.
1781	Donald Trump	And we got them Accountability.
1782	Donald Trump	You couldn't fire anybody in the VA. You had sadists.
1783	Donald Trump	You had people that took advantage of our veterans.
1784	Donald Trump	They've hit them.
1785	Donald Trump	They were sadists.
1786	Donald Trump	They were sick people.
1787	Donald Trump	You couldn’t fire them.
1788	Donald Trump	You had thieves that were stealing -- openly stealing.
1789	Donald Trump	You couldn't fire them.
1790	Donald Trump	I got a bill passed: VA Accountability.
1791	Donald Trump	Now you look at the guy, you say, "Get the hell out of here.
1792	Donald Trump	You're fired.
1793	Donald Trump	Get out."
1794	Donald Trump	Nobody thought we could get it.
1795	Donald Trump	For 40 years they tried to get it.
1796	Donald Trump	For 40 years they tried to get it; they couldn't get it.
1797	Donald Trump	And VA Choice, they thought -- for many, many decades they'd been trying to get VA Choice.
1798	Donald Trump	You couldn’t get it.
1799	Donald Trump	Now, instead of waiting on line for two days, nine days, three weeks -- people were dying.
1800	Donald Trump	People that weren't very sick would be dead by the time they saw a doctor, six weeks later.
1801	Donald Trump	Now these great veterans, if there's a big wait, they go outside, they go to a local doctor.
1802	Donald Trump	We pay the bills.
1803	Donald Trump	They get better.
1804	Donald Trump	Everybody is happy.
1805	Donald Trump	And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it.
1806	Donald Trump	And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved -- for our veterans.
1807	Donald Trump	We love our veterans.
1808	Donald Trump	And just in finishing up, as you know, I just returned from Vietnam, where I had very productive meetings with Chairman Kim Jong Un.
1809	Donald Trump	Very productive.
1810	Donald Trump	We get along.
1811	Donald Trump	We've developed a good relationship -- very good -- and made great historic progress.
1812	Donald Trump	And I do get a kick out of all these people in previous administrations: "Donald Trump should not, under any circumstances, be doing this or that."
1813	Donald Trump	You know, they're telling me how to negotiate.
1814	Donald Trump	These guys died.
1815	Donald Trump	One administration gave billions of dollars to him and got nothing.
1816	Donald Trump	And we haven't given him anything yet.
1817	Donald Trump	I look forward to maybe doing something at some point.
1818	Donald Trump	But I know one thing: I'm going to get other countries to give.
1819	Donald Trump	Maybe not us, but I'm going to get other countries to give, and if it all works out.
1820	Donald Trump	If it all works out.
1821	Donald Trump	But I had to walk.
1822	Donald Trump	Because every once in a while, you have to walk, because the deal wasn't a deal that was acceptable to me.
1823	Donald Trump	I don't like these deals that politicians make.
1824	Donald Trump	They make a deal just for the sake of doing it.
1825	Donald Trump	I don't want to do that.
1826	Donald Trump	I want to make a deal that either works, or let's not make it.
1827	Donald Trump	But the one thing we have, though, is we have no testing, no missiles going up, no rockets going up.
1828	Donald Trump	No nuclear testing.
1829	Donald Trump	We got our great people back.
1830	Donald Trump	We get our great, great people.
1831	Donald Trump	And that includes our beautiful, beautiful Otto -- Otto Warmbier -- whose parents I've gotten to know, who's incredible.
1832	Donald Trump	And I'm in such a horrible position, because in one way I have to negotiate.
1833	Donald Trump	In the other way, I love Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier, and I love Otto.
1834	Donald Trump	And it's a very, very delicate balance.
1835	Donald Trump	He was a special young man.
1836	Donald Trump	And to see what happened was so bad.
1837	Donald Trump	It was so bad.
1838	Donald Trump	And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea, and any success that we hopefully have -- and we've had a lot.
1839	Donald Trump	We're given no credit.
1840	Donald Trump	They don't remember that, in the last days of the Obama administration, rockets were flying all over the place, nuclear testing was going on.
1841	Donald Trump	Mountains were being -- these are big mountains.
1842	Donald Trump	They were being shoved over three, four inches.
1843	Donald Trump	People thought it was massive earthquakes, then they found out, no, that was nuclear weapons -- nuclear testing.
1844	Donald Trump	So much.
1845	Donald Trump	We're getting the remains back of a lot of our soldiers from many, many years ago.
1846	Donald Trump	Mike Pence was in Hawaii.
1847	Donald Trump	It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies.
1848	Donald Trump	We've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to make progress.
1849	Donald Trump	And I really think what we're doing there is very important.
1850	Donald Trump	But we actually had to walk, but I think we had a very good meeting.
1851	Donald Trump	In fact, when I came home, they put out a statement that, actually, they were willing to do much less on the sanction front.
1852	Donald Trump	But you see, that's not what happened there.
1853	Donald Trump	So already, I think we're negotiating.
1854	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you this: North Korea has an incredible, brilliant economic future, if they make a deal.
1855	Donald Trump	But they don't have any economic future if they have nuclear weapons.
1856	Donald Trump	It's really a bad thing for them.
1857	Donald Trump	So we'll see how it all goes.
1858	Donald Trump	But I think it's going well.
1859	Donald Trump	I think we learned a lot over the last couple of days.
1860	Donald Trump	And again, the relationship seems to be very, very strong.
1861	Donald Trump	And that's an important thing, especially when we're dealing with this kind of a situation.
1862	Donald Trump	For years, you watched as your leaders apologized for America.
1863	Donald Trump	You saw that.
1864	Donald Trump	Would you like to apologize?
1865	Donald Trump	No.
1866	Donald Trump	I'm not apologizing.
1867	Donald Trump	Now you have a President who is standing up for America.
1868	Donald Trump	After decades of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation, and we are doing it with American hands, American grit, and with beautiful, beautiful American steel.
1869	Donald Trump	We are fighting to ensure that every young American inherits the same blessings and the same boundless opportunity that our ancestors fought to secure with all of their heart, might, and soul.
1870	Donald Trump	Now more than ever, we need the proud men and women of CPAC.
1871	Donald Trump	And I want to thank everybody here, because it is incredible.
1872	Donald Trump	Your organization is incredible.
1873	Donald Trump	Matt and Mercedes, incredible.
1874	Donald Trump	You're energized, you're mobilized, and you're engaged.
1875	Donald Trump	We need your voice.
1876	Donald Trump	We need your patriotism.
1877	Donald Trump	We need your commitment.
1878	Donald Trump	We need your incredible spirit on the Fourth of July.
1879	Donald Trump	We are having, in Washington, D.C., a great tribute to America.
1880	Donald Trump	I hope you can all come.
1881	Donald Trump	Fourth of July -- keep it open.
1882	Donald Trump	We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country.
1883	Donald Trump	Those are the people we want.
1884	Donald Trump	The Fourth of July.
1885	Donald Trump	A salute to America.
1886	Donald Trump	Now is the time to embrace the promise of our history.
1887	Donald Trump	Now is the time to defend our American legacy.
1888	Donald Trump	And now is the time to seize our glorious destiny.
1889	Donald Trump	And, by the way, I'm watching those doors.
1890	Donald Trump	Not one person has left, and I've been up here a long time.
1891	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
1892	Donald Trump	I said, "Matt, is that okay?"
1893	Donald Trump	He said, "I love it.
1894	Donald Trump	Don't leave."
1895	Donald Trump	But not one person.
1896	Donald Trump	So if you hear tomorrow, when they read "people left" -- nobody left early.
1897	Donald Trump	There hasn't been one person that's left.
1898	Donald Trump	But when you read it, you just say "fake news."
1899	Donald Trump	This magnificent nation will always be the home of those who cherish life, who love liberty, and who defend the sacred rights given to us by Almighty God.
1900	Donald Trump	Together, we are one people, one family, and one nation, forever united behind one great American flag.
1901	Donald Trump	Thank you to everybody in this room and to all of the other rooms, all over the campus and all over the country.
1902	Donald Trump	We're hooked in all over the country.
1903	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
1904	Donald Trump	I want to thank CPAC.
1905	Donald Trump	What a job they've done.
1906	Donald Trump	What a job Matt Schlapp and his family have done in such a short period of time, in bringing this to a level like it's never been before.
1907	Donald Trump	God bless you.
1908	Donald Trump	God bless the United States of America.
1909	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
