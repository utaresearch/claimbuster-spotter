23	Donald Trump	And finally — I love you, too.
24	Donald Trump	I'd like to introduce a true leader, a proud veteran, my great friend, a tough, brilliant cookie.
25	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
26	Donald Trump	True.
27	Donald Trump	He's tough, he's smart, and he loves Florida, and he loves our country, and he's going to be your next governor, Ron DeSantis.
28	SYSTEM	[Inaudible]
29	Ron DeSantis	Welcome to Florida, Mr. President.
30	SYSTEM	[Applause]
31	Ron DeSantis	For someone who grew up just across the bay in Pinellas County, starting out working six bucks an hour, it's a true honor to be standing here, endorsed by the President of the United States.
32	Ron DeSantis	I appreciate your support, Mr. President, but I appreciate more the leadership you're showing for our great country.
33	Ron DeSantis	We have the strongest economy we've had in years.
34	Ron DeSantis	We are standing foursquare behind our ally, the State of Israel.
35	Ron DeSantis	We have strong Constitutionalists was being put on our courts, including the Supreme Court.
36	Ron DeSantis	We have ended the disastrous Iran deal.
37	Ron DeSantis	And under the president's leadership, we are standing against socialist dictatorships in Latin America like Cuba and Venezuela and Nicaragua.
38	Ron DeSantis	Florida is going in the right direction, and we need to continue our success and build upon it.
39	Ron DeSantis	We can't go back to the days of Charlie Crist, where the good ol' boys run the show.
40	SYSTEM	[Booing]
41	Ron DeSantis	We can make our state without peer for economic opportunity if we continue with strong Conservative policies.
42	Ron DeSantis	We can fight illegal immigration.
43	Ron DeSantis	All we've got to do is enact E-Verify and stop sanctuary cities.
44	Ron DeSantis	We can end judicial activism in Florida by appointing solid Constitutionalists to our state courts, just like the president has done to the federal courts.
45	Ron DeSantis	And we can improve our education system by stopping Common Core, by -- by giving every child, regardless of circumstance, the ability to attend a good school, and by getting the Constitution back in our classrooms in a very big way.
46	Ron DeSantis	So, Mr. President, thank you for your support, thank you for what you're doing for the state of Florida.
47	Ron DeSantis	I ask for your vote in the August primary, August 28th, I'd be honored to have it.
48	Ron DeSantis	Thank you guys and God bless America, thank you.
49	Donald Trump	Thank you.
50	Donald Trump	Thank you, Ron.
51	Donald Trump	And everybody needs to support Ron DeSantis in our August 28th primary and in the November general election, don't forget.
52	Donald Trump	You have somebody, one of the group is going to be running on open borders, anti-ICE, anti-law enforcement.

58	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
59	Donald Trump	Too bad.
60	Donald Trump	Sorry about that, Ron.
61	Donald Trump	Earlier today I also spent time with your current Governor, one of our nation's truly great leaders, Rick Scott. As you know, Rick is running to replace liberal Democrat, Schumer-controlled, Nancy Pelosi-controlled ...
62	SYSTEM	[Booing]
63	Donald Trump	... And the new star of the Democrat Party, Maxine Waters.
64	SYSTEM	[Booing]
65	Donald Trump	Name is Bill Nelson, and you know I live a lot of time in Florida.
66	Donald Trump	The only time I see Bill Nelson is five months before every election.
67	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
68	Donald Trump	And after a while you forget, who's the Senator?
69	Donald Trump	But around five months you see him at parties and you see him around and we have to be careful, because we have to make sure that Rick Scott wins and wins big.
70	Donald Trump	Bill Nelson voted for Obamacare, which has been a totally disastrous situation.
71	SYSTEM	[Booing]
72	Donald Trump	And we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular aspect and most of Obamacare will be gone very soon. In fact, it was gone until one gentleman decided at 2:00 in the morning ...
73	SYSTEM	[Booing]
74	Donald Trump	Remember?
75	Donald Trump	Thank you very much, we appreciate it.
76	Donald Trump	And he voted against tax cuts, and he wants to go in there and raise your taxes.
77	Donald Trump	Tell me, is that good politics?
78	Donald Trump	I don't think so. Bill Nelson voted in favor of sanctuary cities ...
79	SYSTEM	[Booing]
80	Donald Trump	He opposed Kate's Law.
81	Donald Trump	Bill Nelson puts criminal aliens before American citizens, which is why it's time to vote Bill Nelson out of office.
82	Donald Trump	That's what's going to happen.
83	Donald Trump	And we have two unbelievable people — Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott — fighting for Florida.
84	Donald Trump	They always will.
85	Donald Trump	And fighting to make America great again.
86	Donald Trump	That's what they're doing.
87	Donald Trump	That's what they're doing.
88	Donald Trump	So — I'm sure we all say this about our children, but I have great children.
89	Donald Trump	And a couple of them-plus are here tonight.
90	Donald Trump	I have Eric Trump, who's been fantastic.
91	Donald Trump	He loves this political stuff.
92	Donald Trump	Eric's wife, Lara, who is so great.
93	Donald Trump	I think she singlehandedly won the state of North Carolina for Trump.
94	Donald Trump	Thank you, Lara.
95	Donald Trump	Didn't hurt in Pennsylvania, either.
96	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
97	Donald Trump	And we have somebody that nobody ever heard of, Ivanka.
98	Donald Trump	Ivanka.
99	Donald Trump	Thank you.
100	Donald Trump	And, you know, we have a big thing happening because you know this — look at all those hats.
101	Donald Trump	White ones, red ones, they all have the same thing, "Make America Great."
102	Donald Trump	Well, make America great again.
103	Donald Trump	Only to be replaced by "Keep America Great" in about, I don't know, I guess we could do it now but let's wait another year.
104	Donald Trump	We could do it right now, frankly.
105	Donald Trump	We're doing fantastically well.
106	Donald Trump	I also want to thank David Bossie for being here, Corey Lewandowski for being here, two of our great supporters.
107	Donald Trump	I'll tell you, they are two fighters.
108	Donald Trump	We like fighters, don't we?
109	Donald Trump	We started off, it was a small group.
110	Donald Trump	They said it couldn't be done.
111	Donald Trump	It was actually done quite easily.
112	Donald Trump	We won quite handily.
113	Donald Trump	We were never left center stage.
114	Donald Trump	You know what that means, right?
115	Donald Trump	The debates.
116	Donald Trump	We never left center stage.
117	Donald Trump	And I said, "I always want odd numbers."
118	Donald Trump	Because I want to be in the center.
119	Donald Trump	I didn't want to be tied for the center.
120	Donald Trump	Does everybody understand?
121	Donald Trump	But we never — we never left center stage.
122	Donald Trump	And I'll tell you.
123	Donald Trump	Corey, David, Ivanka, Lara, Eric, Don, Jr., all of them, they were fantastic.
124	Donald Trump	They were fantastic.
125	Donald Trump	And I have to say, our First Lady is home watching.
126	Donald Trump	Look at all those cameras right there.
127	Donald Trump	She's home watching.

129	Donald Trump	They love Melania.
130	Donald Trump	Great.
131	Donald Trump	Doing a fantastic thing.
132	Donald Trump	She's doing a fantastic job.
133	Donald Trump	Just last week, it was announced that the U.S. economy grew at 4.1 percent last quarter.
134	Donald Trump	It was a number that everybody said was not reachable.
135	Donald Trump	And I would never want to say it during the campaign, even though I believed it.
136	Donald Trump	I believed it, because they would not have given us the break.

141	Donald Trump	Wouldn't you think they'd get tired of these speeches?
142	Donald Trump	Wouldn't you think?
143	Donald Trump	And here's one thing I'll tell you: If they don't get ratings, those speeches don't go on, doesn't matter.
144	Donald Trump	Look how many they have back there.
145	Donald Trump	They just can't get enough.
146	Donald Trump	They can't get enough.
147	Donald Trump	They cannot get enough.
148	Donald Trump	And by the way, outside, if you want to go, we set up, for the first time, a tremendous movie screen, because we have thousands and thousands of people outside that couldn't get in.
149	Donald Trump	So we have a big screen and big loudspeakers, and I hope you're all happy out there.
150	Donald Trump	This is a great place to be.
151	Donald Trump	If you've got to be outside, be outside in the great state of Florida, right?
152	Donald Trump	Right?
153	Donald Trump	So we're setting records like never before.
154	Donald Trump	Since the election, we have added 3.7 million new jobs.
155	Donald Trump	They would not have believed that.
156	Donald Trump	We're in the longest positive job growth streak in history.
157	Donald Trump	Think of that.

159	Donald Trump	What do I — OK?
160	Donald Trump	What do you have to lose?

186	Donald Trump	American oil production is at an all-time high, we have never produced as much.
187	Donald Trump	And the United States is now a net natural gas exporter for the first time in more than 60 years — 60.
188	Donald Trump	We will very shortly be the largest in the world in energy, the largest in the world, think of that.
189	Donald Trump	And most importantly, America is being respected again, we're respected again.
190	Donald Trump	And I told the story the other day, I get to meet all these world leaders.
191	Donald Trump	Virtually everyone comes into the Oval Office or wherever we're meeting and they don't know me.
192	Donald Trump	I'm meeting them in many cases for the first time.
193	Donald Trump	I'm not sure they like me, like in the case of NATO.
194	Donald Trump	I said you got to pay your bills, folks, got to pay up, got to pay up.
195	Donald Trump	But they liked it, they liked it.
196	Donald Trump	But everyone that reached me says hello, Mr. President, congratulations on what you've done for the economy.
197	Donald Trump	It's the talk of the world, talk of the world.
198	Donald Trump	Now that we have the best economy in the history of our country, this is the time to straighten out the worst trade deals ever made by any country on Earth, they are the worst.

213	Donald Trump	It's us, it's not me, it's us altogether.
214	Donald Trump	They know it's one of our great strengths.
215	Donald Trump	We won every farm state, you're going to see that middle of that map – wasn't even the middle, it was about everything but a little corners of each side.
216	Donald Trump	But you have to see, that is all red, Republican red, beautiful, Republican red.

285	Donald Trump	Last week I visited with hundreds of American steel workers, who were laid off years ago because other countries were dumping steel all over our country.
286	Donald Trump	They're not dumping so much anymore, you notice?
287	Donald Trump	And if they do, they're paying a 25 percent tariff or tax.

373	Donald Trump	Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities and towns from savage gangs like MS-13 that are occupying our country like another nation would.
374	Donald Trump	We want maximum border security and respect for our heroes, ICE, Border Patrol and law enforcement.
375	Donald Trump	And we're going to have tremendous border security that will include the wall — that will include the wall.
376	Donald Trump	Now a lot of people don't know it but we've already started the wall.
377	Donald Trump	We got $1.6 billion and we've started large portions of the wall, but we're going to need – even the way we negotiate, we're going to need more and we're going to get more and we may have to do some pretty drastic things, but we're going to get it.
378	Donald Trump	Because the Democrats – the Democrats are not voting for what we want to do and they're not voting and allowing our values to take place in our country.
379	SYSTEM	[Booing]
380	Donald Trump	We're tracking down the gang members and we're tracking down the drug dealers and the child predators and the criminal aliens and we're throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country.
381	Donald Trump	In some states, Democrats are even trying to give illegal immigrants the right to vote.
382	Donald Trump	They want to give them the right to vote.

384	Donald Trump	Yeah, what about all of those people that are waiting in line for 7, 8, 9, 10 years trying to get into our country, they don't have the right to vote.
385	Donald Trump	We believe that only American citizens should vote in American elections -- Which is why the time has come for voter ID like everything else, voter ID.
386	Donald Trump	You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card, you need ID.
387	Donald Trump	You go out and you want to buy anything, you need ID and you need your picture.
388	Donald Trump	In this country, the only time you don't need it in many cases is when you want to vote for a president, when you want to vote for a senator, when you want to vote for a governor or a congressman, it's crazy, it's crazy.

390	Donald Trump	But we're turning it around.
391	Donald Trump	Remember I said it's awfully early to be thinking this, but I always think it, remember the attack on Merry Christmas, they're not attacking it anymore.
392	Donald Trump	Everyone is happy to say Merry Christmas, right?
393	Donald Trump	Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.
394	Donald Trump	That was under siege.
395	Donald Trump	You have these big department stores they say, "Happy Holidays."
396	Donald Trump	I say, "Where is the Merry Christmas?"
397	Donald Trump	Now they're all putting up Merry Christmas again and that's because — only because of our campaign.
398	Donald Trump	And by the way, the evangelicals and Paula White, Pastor Paula White, the evangelicals have been so amazing to us.
399	Donald Trump	They came out and they voted 84 percent and doubled and tripled the numbers that ever voted in an election before.
400	Donald Trump	We love the evangelical Christians.
401	Donald Trump	If you want safety, if you want borders, if you want to have a country, then you need to go out and vote Republican.
402	Donald Trump	And very importantly, you need to go out and vote for Ron DeSantis for governor of Florida.
403	Donald Trump	The lobbyists and special interests fighting against my administration, many of them are globalist.

407	Donald Trump	They're the geniuses who came up with our terrible trade deals one after another, how about NAFTA, remember when they signed NAFTA?
408	SYSTEM	[Booing]
409	Donald Trump	Remember they signed NAFTA and everybody just moved their companies down to Mexico and these people were saying, "Isn't that a wonderful thing?"
410	Donald Trump	No, it's not a wonderful thing and those companies are now moving back.
411	Donald Trump	These are the people who lost trillions of dollars overseas and who gave us our horrible immigration laws.
412	Donald Trump	These laws are the worst.
413	Donald Trump	I am for America first and the American worker.
414	Donald Trump	We want to be a puppet for no one any longer.
415	Donald Trump	We're not going to be a puppet any longer.
416	Donald Trump	My only special interest is you, the citizens of the United States.
417	Donald Trump	I've had a great career.
418	Donald Trump	I've got a lot of fun, even in Florida, I've had a great career, I've had a lot of fun.
419	Donald Trump	I've done great.
420	Donald Trump	I've done really well, beyond anything I could've ever expected.
421	Donald Trump	And then I ran for president with no experience and I won.
422	Donald Trump	Isn't that -- But you actually won.
423	Donald Trump	You know, I told the story the other day, I was probably in Washington in my entire life 17 times.
424	Donald Trump	True, 17 times.
425	Donald Trump	I don't think I ever stayed overnight.
426	Donald Trump	You know what I'm getting at, right?
427	Donald Trump	And we have a great cabinet now, a couple of little changes.
428	Donald Trump	But we have a great cabinet.
429	Donald Trump	We have — Mike Pompeo, our Secretary of State.
430	Donald Trump	So many great people.
431	Donald Trump	And we're really getting – we have just incredible people.
432	Donald Trump	But I made some choices that I wouldn't have made.
433	Donald Trump	But I'm riding down Pennsylvania Avenue.
434	Donald Trump	Again, I've only been here about 17 times.
435	Donald Trump	And probably seven of those times was to check out the hotel I'm building on Pennsylvania Avenue and then I hop on the plane and I go back.
436	Donald Trump	So I've been there 17 times, never stayed there at night.
437	Donald Trump	I don't believe.
438	Donald Trump	And then I'm riding down in this beautiful car, picked up at the airport by Secret Service, holding the hand of our great first lady.
439	Donald Trump	And I look at her and I say, "Honey, guess what, I'm president of the United States!"
440	Donald Trump	President of the United States.
441	Donald Trump	And I didn't know anybody in Washington, but now I know everybody in Washington.
442	Donald Trump	I know the good ones.
443	Donald Trump	I know the bad ones.
444	Donald Trump	I know the wonderful people and I know the scum.
445	Donald Trump	And America now is winning again like they haven't won before.
446	Donald Trump	We passed the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history, biggest cuts in history.
447	Donald Trump	More than 100 utilities have slashed rates for consumers including right here from Duke Energy and Tampa Electric.
448	Donald Trump	Your rates have gone down.
449	Donald Trump	Over $300 billion poured back into the United States in the first quarter, and we expect to be taking back because of our new tax cut and reform plan that passed bigger than anything ever in our country.
450	Donald Trump	We expect to be taking back from overseas over $4 trillion.
451	Donald Trump	That's a lot of money — could never have come back before.
452	Donald Trump	And if our opponent had won and the Democrats had won, they would've put more regulations on.
453	Donald Trump	They would've raised your taxes.
454	Donald Trump	They would've opened your borders, gotten rid of law enforcement.
455	Donald Trump	They would not have helped your military.
456	Donald Trump	And you know what?
457	Donald Trump	Our country would be going to hell.
458	Donald Trump	And instead of going up, the market would be half of what it was if we're lucky, because frankly the tax cuts were incredible to what we've done.
459	Donald Trump	But maybe even more important are the cuts in these horrible regulations that didn't allow anybody to do anything, job-killing regulations.
460	Donald Trump	We've gotten rid of more regulations than any president in the history of the United States.
461	Donald Trump	And that's done in less than two years.
462	Donald Trump	I withdrew the United States from the unfair one-sided very, very expensive job-killing Paris Climate Accord.
463	Donald Trump	We repealed the core of Obamacare.
464	Donald Trump	The individual mandate is gone.
465	Donald Trump	You know, the individual mandate.
466	Donald Trump	That's a beauty.
467	Donald Trump	Only the past administration could have come up with this.
468	Donald Trump	That's where you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not paying in order to have poor health care.
469	Donald Trump	Other than that, it's a wonderful thing.
470	Donald Trump	So you pay all this money for the privilege of not having to pay and the health care is no good to start off with.
471	Donald Trump	And we're doing great on health care.
472	Donald Trump	We're allowing Americans to buy better health care for less money through association health plans, including across state lines, bidding, you're getting tremendous competition.
473	Donald Trump	We passed the biggest VA reform in half a century, Veteran's Choice.
474	Donald Trump	If our veterans can't get the care they need from the VA, they will have the right to go see a private doctor.
475	Donald Trump	We'll pay for the doctor.
476	Donald Trump	And frankly, we'll save a lot of money.
477	Donald Trump	We'll help a lot of vets.
478	Donald Trump	Everybody said they've been trying to get it for 45 years, everybody said you can't get it.
479	Donald Trump	Think of it.
480	Donald Trump	Think of it.
481	Donald Trump	Veterans Choice, they have to stand – our great people.
482	Donald Trump	These are our great people.
483	Donald Trump	Who's a veteran in this audience?
484	Donald Trump	Do you like Trump?
485	Donald Trump	Do you like the job we're doing?
486	Donald Trump	Now, think of it, 45 years, everybody said you'll never get it passed.
487	Donald Trump	And I used to say before I really was well-versed on the veteran situation in health care, I used to say all the time, "Why don't they just let the folks go to a doctor?"
488	Donald Trump	They'd wait in line for 7 days, 9 days, 14 days, 21 days.
489	Donald Trump	Some of them started off with a very modest problem.
490	Donald Trump	They end up being terminal because they can't see a doctor.
491	Donald Trump	I said, "Why don't they just let them go see a local private doctor, pay the bill and take care of it?"
492	Donald Trump	It will be a lot less expensive.
493	Donald Trump	And it's turned out to be something that the veterans love.
494	Donald Trump	And it's passed.
495	Donald Trump	It's passed.
496	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get it passed for 38 years.
497	Donald Trump	The other one is 45, and that's VA accountability.
498	Donald Trump	If somebody treated our veterans badly, if they stole, if they was – if they were – you know this, if they were sadistic, if they were really bad to our vets, all right?
499	Donald Trump	Really, really bad, we couldn't do anything about it.
500	Donald Trump	They could steal.
501	Donald Trump	They could rob.
502	Donald Trump	They could be abusive.
503	Donald Trump	You couldn't say, "You're fired."
504	Donald Trump	Now you can say, "You're fired."
505	Donald Trump	Made a big difference.
506	Donald Trump	That was another one they said you'll never get it done between civil service and unions.
507	Donald Trump	We love them both.
508	Donald Trump	But between civil service and unions they said, "You'll never get it done.
509	Donald Trump	You'll never get it approved."
510	Donald Trump	And by the way, we had virtually no help, very little from Democrats.
511	Donald Trump	Very little.
512	Donald Trump	Not because it's not right, but because they don't want to give Trump any victory.
513	Donald Trump	They'll do everything that's wrong.
514	Donald Trump	Look at Judge Kavanaugh.
515	Donald Trump	This is a great, great highly respected man.
516	Donald Trump	And the good news is the Republicans, I believe, are close to a hundred percent, which is what we need.
517	Donald Trump	But so far, the Democrats haven't given us any votes, and that's because they will do anything they can to not help the Trump agenda, even though they know it's wrong.
518	SYSTEM	[Booing]
519	Donald Trump	And Brett Kavanaugh, highest education, best grades, best tests, best everything.
520	Donald Trump	They thought 15 years ago he was going to be a Supreme Court judge.
521	Donald Trump	Look at Justice Gorsuch, how good is he?
522	Donald Trump	How good is he?
523	Donald Trump	So we're getting them through.
524	Donald Trump	But it's not easy because they really are.
525	Donald Trump	You know, their term that they use is, "resist."
526	Donald Trump	It's actually resist and obstruct.
527	Donald Trump	Whatever they can do to resist and obstruct.
528	Donald Trump	And frankly, they're lousy politicians.
529	Donald Trump	They have horrible policy.
530	Donald Trump	The one thing they're good at, they stick together and they obstruct.
531	Donald Trump	And it's unfortunate.
532	Donald Trump	You know, we have almost 400 people trying to get into government, many of whom have left their jobs and the Democrats are holding them up with maximum delay.
533	Donald Trump	They're holding them up, not allowing these great people to serve their country.
534	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
535	Donald Trump	That's Chuck Schumer, and it's a disgrace.
536	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
537	Donald Trump	But we'll get that Supreme Court judge, and that's the big one.
538	Donald Trump	That's the big one.
539	Donald Trump	Really important for those who love our military, we have secured a record $700 billion for our military with another $716 billion next year all approved.
540	Donald Trump	And this is great news for the incredible patriots at MacDill Air Force Base, the proud home of the Sixth Air Mobility Wing U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command.
541	Donald Trump	Come on!
542	Donald Trump	We're adding nearly 30,000 new soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and we have secured the largest pay raise for our great warriors in a decade.
543	Donald Trump	I've also directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating the sixth branch of our military, the space force – building the space force.
544	Donald Trump	And we're doing well in North Korea, although I happen to think that we're doing so well with China that China maybe is getting in our way.
545	Donald Trump	But we're going to figure that one out before you can even think about it.
546	Donald Trump	But we're doing well in North Korea.
547	Donald Trump	We have our – as you know, we have our hostages back.
548	Donald Trump	There's been no nuclear testing.
549	Donald Trump	There's been no missiles or rockets flying beautifully over Japan.
550	Donald Trump	I think our relationship is very good with Chairman Kim, and we'll all see how it all works out.
551	Donald Trump	But there's nothing like talking, and we'll see how it is.
552	Donald Trump	You remember when I first took office?
553	Donald Trump	It really looked like big trouble.
554	Donald Trump	In the past administration, they thought that was by far their biggest problem.
555	Donald Trump	So I think it's going to work out very well.
556	Donald Trump	But a lot of good things are happening.
557	Donald Trump	No tests.
558	Donald Trump	No rockets flying.
559	Donald Trump	But we'll see what happens.
560	Donald Trump	And our Vice President, Mike Pence, is going to Hawaii to bring back the remains and to greet the families of our great heroes who gave their lives in Korea.
561	Donald Trump	Our fallen warriors are finally coming home to lay at rest in American soil.
562	SYSTEM	[Audience Chanting]
563	Donald Trump	I also withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided, $150 billion was paid — $1.8 billion in cash.
564	Donald Trump	The Iran nuclear deal, it's a horror show.
565	Donald Trump	I hope it works out well with Iran, they're having a lot of difficulty right now.
566	Donald Trump	I hope it works out well.
567	Donald Trump	And I have a feeling they'll be talking to us pretty soon.
568	Donald Trump	And maybe not and that's okay too.
569	Donald Trump	In December, I recognized Israel's true capital, Jerusalem.
570	Donald Trump	And in about five months we opened already the American embassy in Jerusalem.
571	Donald Trump	And people had that scheduled for anywhere from five to ten years and you all know the story.
572	Donald Trump	We took an existing building.
573	Donald Trump	We played around with it.
574	Donald Trump	We renovated it.
575	Donald Trump	We fixed it up.
576	Donald Trump	We use Jerusalem stone, one of the finest stones actually in the world, Jerusalem stone.
577	Donald Trump	So, instead of spending 1 billion and the papers were right in front of me – sir, would you please approve this?
578	Donald Trump	What is it?
579	Donald Trump	This is for the embassy in Israel, American, sir.
580	Donald Trump	I said, "How much?"
581	Donald Trump	$1 billion, Sir.
582	Donald Trump	1 billion!
583	Donald Trump	I immediately called our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman — very successful man, great lawyer, one of the most successful lawyers in the country before he decided to do what he's doing.
584	Donald Trump	I said, "David, they want us to pay a billion dollars for the embassy.
585	Donald Trump	I don't want to pay a billion dollars."
586	Donald Trump	I said, "Study it – do you have any buildings that we own?"
587	Donald Trump	We own so much we don't even know what the hell we own.
588	Donald Trump	Find some building in a great location.
589	Donald Trump	Call me back.
590	Donald Trump	Called me back two days later.
591	Donald Trump	He said, "Mr. President, Sir, we own the best site in Jerusalem.
592	Donald Trump	It's big.
593	Donald Trump	It's beautiful and it's got a building on it.
594	Donald Trump	I can take that building and renovate it.
595	Donald Trump	I can do it for $140,000."
596	Donald Trump	I said, "David, how good is the site?"
597	Donald Trump	We could never buy a better site.
598	Donald Trump	They were willing to spend tens of millions for a site.
599	Donald Trump	They wanted to buy a site which was so bad.
600	Donald Trump	It was totally inferior to what we already had.
601	Donald Trump	Don't forget, we get there first, right?
602	Donald Trump	You know, we have good sites.
603	Donald Trump	And I said, "David, do me a favor, don't make it $140,000.
604	Donald Trump	Sounds too cheap.
605	Donald Trump	Make it like 400,000.
606	Donald Trump	That's okay too, David."
607	Donald Trump	So we saved almost a billion dollars.
608	Donald Trump	I could tell you these stories all day long, airplane purchases.
609	Donald Trump	I could tell you all day long.
610	Donald Trump	And we started working – and for $400,000, we actually have a very beautiful American Embassy in Jerusalem — really beautiful.
611	Donald Trump	Now, that's one I guarantee no other president is doing.
612	Donald Trump	Can you imagine crooked Hillary doing that?
613	Donald Trump	Can you, honestly?
614	Donald Trump	Can you imagine?

617	Donald Trump	Nobody else.

619	Donald Trump	And I could tell you stories about what we've saved with purchases of military equipment, General Mattis would be glad to tell you — but he can't believe it.
620	Donald Trump	And some of the generals have said they've never seen anything like it in the world — they've never seen.
621	Donald Trump	Because I want that $700 billion properly spent.
622	Donald Trump	If we can buy twice the number of aircraft or have a lot of money left over that's what we want.
623	Donald Trump	Instead of apologizing for America we're standing up for America.

630	Donald Trump	Even they will say that.
631	Donald Trump	But to keep it going we need to elect more Republicans.
632	Donald Trump	We need more votes.

643	Donald Trump	He won the election by 40 points.
644	Donald Trump	He got 70 percent of the vote — the 30 (ph), think of that.
645	Donald Trump	Great guy.

647	Donald Trump	I mean, we could go over one after another, after — they're actually starting to give us credit for this.
648	Donald Trump	I don't think there's ever been anything like it.
649	Donald Trump	That's why I had to be here to formally — you know, I've been endorsing Ron, I've been saying great things but I wanted to be here to formally endorse Ron, you got to get out and vote.
