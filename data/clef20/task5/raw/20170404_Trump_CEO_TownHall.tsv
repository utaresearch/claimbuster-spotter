1	Donald Trump	Thank you, Mike.
2	Donald Trump	Good morning.
3	Donald Trump	Hello, Ivanka.
4	Reed Cordish	I know you know a few of the people in this room.
5	Donald Trump	I do.
6	Donald Trump	I do.
7	Donald Trump	All the killers from New York -- I'm looking at all those competitive -- those great, great talents, great builders.
8	Reed Cordish	I have to give you a heads-up that Ivanka chaired one of the sessions before this -- tough act to follow.
9	Donald Trump	Oh, she's tough.
10	Donald Trump	Very tough.
11	Reed Cordish	Vice President Pence listed some of the amazing accomplishments that have taken place since your election and your 75 days in office.
12	Reed Cordish	The stock market has had almost unprecedented sustained growth, unprecedented confidence from our manufacturing sector and other business sectors, leading to massive private sector investment in job growth.
13	Reed Cordish	You have gotten rid of regulations that were unnecessary and were job-stifling.
14	Reed Cordish	You have strengthened our borders and strengthened our military.
15	Reed Cordish	You've nominated a great -- superb Supreme Court justice, amongst many other things.
16	Reed Cordish	How does all that feel?
17	Donald Trump	And we're getting unbelievable credit for what we've done, other than the mainstream media, which just gives us no credit whatsoever.
18	Donald Trump	But we are getting tremendous credit.
19	Donald Trump	And if you look at the real estate industry, the mining industry, the farming industry -- if you look at any of the major industries you see what's going.
20	Donald Trump	In fact, even today I was very happy as I read this morning early that our trade deficit with others has gone down very considerably in the last short period of time.
21	Donald Trump	It's having a big impact.
22	Donald Trump	And, as you know, I'm meeting with the President of China on Thursday and Friday in Palm Beach, Florida, and I think we're going to have a very interesting talk.
23	Donald Trump	We're having -- have a lot of respect for him.
24	Donald Trump	I've spoken to him numerous times.
25	Donald Trump	But we have to do better, because our deficit with China, as you know, $504 billion.
26	Donald Trump	That's a year.
27	Donald Trump	That's enough for a lifetime.
28	Donald Trump	Even Steve would say that.
29	Donald Trump	But that's a year.
30	Donald Trump	So we're going to have a great meeting, I'm sure we're going to have a fantastic meeting.
31	Donald Trump	And we're going to talk about a lot of things, including, of course, North Korea, a problem.
32	Donald Trump	And that's really a humanity problem.
33	Donald Trump	So we're going to be talking about that also.
34	Reed Cordish	You have made it a driving force in this administration to bring in the best minds we can from the private sector, to listen intently to them and to take decisive action.
35	Reed Cordish	How important is that, and how important is it to reform government to bridge the gap between the private and public sectors?
36	Donald Trump	Well, I did, I brought you, I brought Gary Cohn, I brought a lot of very great people -- my friend, Steve, is helping us out.
37	Donald Trump	We have a superstar committee of 22 people.
38	Donald Trump	And every time somebody calls me I say, Steve, put them on -- no, we want to keep it at this level.
39	Donald Trump	The heads of the biggest companies, they all want to be on our committee, right, Stephen?
40	Donald Trump	But Steve likes to keep it very small.
41	Donald Trump	But they will go off and they'll disappear and we'll put others on.
42	Donald Trump	But we've had some great meetings and we've all learned a lot.
43	Donald Trump	One thing that did come up, and it came up yesterday, was Gary Cohn -- where's Gary?
44	Donald Trump	Is he here?
45	Donald Trump	Could you bring that chart, please?
46	Donald Trump	Do you mind?
47	Donald Trump	Let me see that chart.
48	Donald Trump	So this was just something -- this is sort of incredible.
49	Donald Trump	That's so beautiful.
50	Donald Trump	Yeah, no, you're not quite -- this is to build a highway in the United States -- now, this was just done yesterday.
51	Donald Trump	I saw it for the first time.
52	Donald Trump	I said, I'm speaking to some of my friends who are builders, really great builders, and they've gone through the process -- we've all gone through it in New York -- we call it the zoning process in New York.
53	Donald Trump	But you start up here and this is anywhere from a 10 to 20-year process.
54	Donald Trump	You have -- is it 17 agencies.
55	Donald Trump	You have hundreds and hundreds of permits.
56	Donald Trump	Many of them are statutory, where you can't even apply for the second permit until six months go by.
57	Donald Trump	So this is to build a highway.
58	Donald Trump	This is a simple highway.
59	Donald Trump	And these are the agencies -- so it's 17 agencies.
60	Donald Trump	How many different steps is it?
61	Question	Sixteen different approvals.
62	Donald Trump	Sixteen.
63	Question	Twenty-nine different statutes.
64	Question	Five different executive orders that all apply to this process.
65	Question	This is indicative, so this is not a specific project, but this is the type of process that a government -- this is a state government -- would have to go through to permit a highway federally.
66	Question	This is just federal, not state regulations.
67	Donald Trump	So it can take anywhere from 10 -- if you're really good, 10 years to 20 years.
68	Donald Trump	And then they vote, and you lose.
69	Donald Trump	They don't want it.
70	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
71	Donald Trump	And it costs sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars just to go through the process.
72	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
73	Donald Trump	That was a great job you did.
74	Donald Trump	Be careful, don't fall.
75	Donald Trump	I don't want to have you fall.
76	Donald Trump	You'll be a big story in the paper if you go down.
77	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
78	Donald Trump	So I just saw that yesterday.
79	Donald Trump	Gary Cohn walked in and he showed it to me, and -- for no reason.
80	Donald Trump	I said, you have to do me a favor.
81	Donald Trump	But a lot of you, you're such pros, some of the best pros in the world sitting in this room, you understand it.
82	Donald Trump	It's a process.
83	Donald Trump	Now, I've always liked it because it gave people that could go through that process an advantage, like Jerry, but it gave us an advantage if you could get through the process.
84	Donald Trump	But getting a building approved in New York is a horrible, horrible thing.
85	Donald Trump	And that's nothing compared to when you get into the highways and the dams -- they don't even talk about dams anymore.
86	Donald Trump	Hydropower is a great, great, form of power -- we don't even talk about it, because to get the environmental permits are virtually impossible.
87	Donald Trump	It's one of the best things you can do -- hydro.
88	Donald Trump	But we don't talk about it anymore.
89	Donald Trump	So we've come to a halt.
90	Donald Trump	We have a tremendous person that we put in charge of EPA, Scott Pruitt, who is an environmental person.
91	Donald Trump	He wants clean air, he wants clean water, but he doesn't thing it takes you 26 years to get a permit to build a building and to have jobs, at which time those companies are usually gone, out of business, et cetera.
92	Donald Trump	So we're really speeding up the process.
93	Donald Trump	We're going to try and take that process from a minimum of 10 years down to one year.
94	Donald Trump	I said can't we make it four months?
95	Donald Trump	Can't we do it in four months?
96	Donald Trump	And there is a certain logic to that, but we'll be satisfied with the year -- but it won't be any more than a year.
97	Donald Trump	So we have to build roads.
98	Donald Trump	We have to build highways.
99	Donald Trump	We're talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars -- perhaps even more.
100	Donald Trump	And when we have to do -- our jobs -- I mean, if we say, we're giving to New York City hundreds of millions of dollars to build a road someplace, it doesn't help if they can't start because it's going to take seven and a half years to get the permits.
101	Donald Trump	Even to redo a road takes years to get the permits.
102	Donald Trump	You know, you have a road that's there and you want to redo it, and you have to get new permits for the kind of asphalt you're using, the kind of concrete you may want to use.
103	Donald Trump	And if we're going to give all of this money -- you know, there was very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration -- a trillion dollars -- nobody ever saw anything being built.
104	Donald Trump	I mean, to this day, I haven't heard of anything that's been built.
105	Donald Trump	They used most of that money -- it went, and they used it on social programs.
106	Donald Trump	And we want this to be on infrastructure.
107	Donald Trump	I'm working with Steve Roth and with Richard LeFrak -- two friends of mine that are very good builders.
108	Donald Trump	They're great builders.
109	Donald Trump	And they know to get things done.
110	Donald Trump	They know how to cut red tape.
111	Donald Trump	We're going to give them the advantage of having what we have.
112	Donald Trump	I see Elaine is here, so important, who is doing an incredible job, by the way -- Secretary of Transportation.
113	Donald Trump	And Elaine will be working.
114	Donald Trump	But we're going to set up a committee headed by Steve and Richard, and we're going to cut a lot of red tape.
115	Donald Trump	But we don't want to send a billion dollars to New York and find out, five years later, the money was never spent, because we're going to be very strong that it has to be spent on shovels, not on other programs.
116	Donald Trump	And in the last case, a lot of it was spent on other programs.
117	Donald Trump	But we're going to say, if you don't spend the money -- if you don't start -- if you have a job that you can't start within 90 days, we're not going to give you the money for it.
118	Donald Trump	Because it doesn't help -- doesn't help us.
119	Donald Trump	And we're going to be very strong on that.
120	Donald Trump	They have to be able to start within 90 days.
121	Reed Cordish	Mr. President, we have some of the great business leaders in the country here.
122	Reed Cordish	If okay with you, they have a few questions, if that's --
123	Donald Trump	Sure.
124	Reed Cordish	Great.
125	Donald Trump	Hello, Jerry.
126	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
127	Jerry Speyer	Hi, Mr. President.
128	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
129	Donald Trump	He didn't have to say his name.
130	Donald Trump	He was ready to say his name -- we know.
131	Donald Trump	Jerry Speyer, everybody.
132	Jerry Speyer	Mr. President, you're doing a great job, and we're all really grateful to you for the sacrifices you're making.
133	Jerry Speyer	Hope you heard that.
134	Donald Trump	That sounds much better.
135	Jerry Speyer	I think from New York's point of view we send a lot of money into the economy.
136	Jerry Speyer	As a number of people have said, it's over a trillion dollars.
137	Jerry Speyer	We're worried we're going to have a problem with Congress.
138	Donald Trump	With the deductions, right?
139	Jerry Speyer	Well, that, too.
140	Jerry Speyer	That, too.
141	Jerry Speyer	But we're worried about various programs that help the city.
142	Jerry Speyer	The city is doing fine right now -- even the Yankees are doing fine.
143	Jerry Speyer	But what we're really concerned about is the future.
144	Jerry Speyer	Do you have any advice for us?
145	Donald Trump	Look, I love New York.
146	Donald Trump	And in some ways we're all lucky that I'm from New York,, because New York has unique problems.
147	Donald Trump	So does Los Angeles, so does Chicago.
148	Donald Trump	There are places that have unique problems.
149	Donald Trump	One of the problems that you have is debt and deductibility.
150	Donald Trump	That's a big one, because a lot of the states that don't have debt or have very little debt -- like in the case of Mike Pence, where he did such a good job in Indiana, and it's a AAA-rated bond, one of the strongest in the country, and deductibility is not that big of a deal because they don't have that much to deduct.
151	Donald Trump	And over here, in New York, when you look at what's going on with us, we don't know in terms of the municipality and in terms of the state, we don't know if it can even make it if you don't have that.
152	Donald Trump	Are people going to buy?
153	Donald Trump	So it's a very big problem.
154	Donald Trump	And the problem I have is that there are many places throughout the country that are in the exact opposite position.
155	Donald Trump	And they consider that a gift to the state and a gift to the people.
156	Donald Trump	And we know New York does things that a lot of people don't read about.
157	Donald Trump	You look at what -- the money they contribute to our economy, to our country, and people don't know about that.
158	Donald Trump	They don't maybe want to know about that.
159	Donald Trump	So you do have -- I call it a tale of two cities.
160	Donald Trump	You have different interests.
161	Donald Trump	But I am watching over everybody, Jerry.
162	Donald Trump	You're in good hands, okay?
163	Donald Trump	You're in good hands, believe me.
164	Donald Trump	You can tell the people of New York.
165	Donald Trump	Even though I didn't win New York State.
166	Donald Trump	I should have won New York State, but I didn't.
167	SYSTEM	[Applause, Laughter]
168	Cathy Engelbert	Mr. President, Cathy Engelbert with Deloitte.
169	Cathy Engelbert	I want to return to a conversation we just had with Ivanka, Dina and Wilbur on jobs, the workforce of the future.
170	Cathy Engelbert	And so as we think about that and we think about our skillsets, in New York City alone our high school -- public high school graduation rate is at 70 percent, but the readiness of our students for college and careers is only 37 -- it's assessed at 37 percent.
171	Cathy Engelbert	So as we look at the pace of change, we look at the digital transformation we all see in business and the marketplace, and we look at the skills that -- this disconnect between what employers need and what our students coming into our workforces are prepared to deliver.
172	Cathy Engelbert	It would be great to get your thoughts on the priorities of the administration around education, around, again, what I like to call not the future of work but the work of the future.
173	Cathy Engelbert	Because the future of work sounds a little ominous, but the work of the future actually sounds pretty visionary.
174	Cathy Engelbert	So if you could give us those priorities --
175	Donald Trump	Okay, so before you sit, so you're giving me numbers from New York.
176	Donald Trump	You're a proud New Yorker, but you're giving me numbers -- why is it doing so badly?
177	Donald Trump	Tell me.
178	Donald Trump	Why are the numbers so horrific in terms of education?
179	Donald Trump	And what happens when somebody goes through school and then they can't read after -- they graduate from high school and they can barely read.
180	Donald Trump	So what's the answer?
181	Cathy Engelbert	Yes.
182	Cathy Engelbert	So, first, I would say that as we look at New York, New York has made enormous progress in a decade.
183	Cathy Engelbert	By the way, that 70 percent was 50 percent, so a 40 percent increase.
184	Cathy Engelbert	So we're making enormous progress in making an impact on --
185	Donald Trump	See how quickly she's changing?
186	Donald Trump	See that?
187	SYSTEM	[Laughter]
188	Cathy Engelbert	Making enormous progress, but we're not done.
189	Cathy Engelbert	We have a lot of work to do.
190	Cathy Engelbert	And I think -- we talked earlier about public/private partnerships, apprenticeship models, which -- we have a beautiful apprenticeship model that works and brings them our next generation of leaders.
191	Cathy Engelbert	So I do think there's a lot we can do through relooking at funding programs.
192	Cathy Engelbert	We talked earlier about consolidating the many programs that are out there.
193	Cathy Engelbert	We're all trying to make our individual impact and we can make a huge impact together.
194	Donald Trump	Sure.
195	Donald Trump	I know you work very hard on it and you have made progress.
196	Donald Trump	Charter schools are another thing that people are talking about a lot, and some of the charter schools in New York have been amazing.
197	Donald Trump	They've done incredibly well.
198	Donald Trump	People can't get in.
199	Donald Trump	I mean, you can't get in.
200	Donald Trump	I don't call it an experiment anymore, it's far beyond an experiment.
201	Donald Trump	If you look at so many elements of education, and it's so sad to see what's coming -- what's happening in the country.
202	Donald Trump	Even the numbers, as good -- you say we're doing better, but the numbers in New York, the numbers in Chicago are very rough.
203	Donald Trump	The numbers in Los Angeles, the cities, it's a very rough situation.
204	Donald Trump	Common Core -- I mean, we have to bring education more local.
205	Donald Trump	We can't be managing education from Washington.
206	Donald Trump	When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally, and they'll do a much better job than somebody -- and look, these are some very good people in Washington, but you also have bureaucrats that make a lot of money and don't really care that much about what they're doing or about the community that they have never seen and they'll never meet, and they never will see.
207	Donald Trump	And I like the fact of getting rid of -- Common Core to me is -- we have to end it.
208	Donald Trump	We have to bring education local.
209	Donald Trump	To me, I've always said it, I've been saying it during the campaign.
210	Donald Trump	And we're doing it.
211	Donald Trump	Betsy DeVos is -- she's doing a terrific job, highly respected, tremendous track record.
212	Donald Trump	But she's got one of the toughest jobs of any of our secretaries, to me.
213	Donald Trump	She's got one of the toughest jobs.
214	Donald Trump	There's some pretty tough jobs out there, but she's got one of the toughest jobs.
215	Donald Trump	We're going to spend a lot of money and a lot of expertise.
216	Donald Trump	We're going to have great talent having to do with education, because there's nothing more important than education.
217	Donald Trump	And we've got to get those numbers in New York better, and I think they will be better.
218	Donald Trump	And a lot of people -- a lot of the greatest people I know in New York, they're totally involved, including Ivanka and Jared, they're so much involved, and it's so important to them, the word "education."
219	Donald Trump	And it's happening, and I see it happening in New York very much.
220	Donald Trump	But it's happening elsewhere, too.
221	Donald Trump	I think we're going to have a great four years.
222	Reed Cordish	Mr. President, I know you have --
223	Donald Trump	Prior to running again.
224	Reed Cordish	-- a pressing issue to deal with.
225	Reed Cordish	Steve and Mike I think just wanted to thank you for attending today, and maybe make a final comment on behalf of --
226	Stephen Schwarman	Well, thanks a lot for being here.
227	Stephen Schwarman	And thanks for everybody for being here.
228	Stephen Schwarman	It's been a really interesting day, and you've had everybody of importance at the event.
229	Stephen Schwarman	I think it's terrific in terms of the stuff you're trying to do to modernize the government, educate, and so forth.
230	Stephen Schwarman	And I think we have to keep a focus on that, because the outside world doesn't always get the message that that's really what's going on -- because you're doing profound things, taking on enormous embedded issues.
231	Stephen Schwarman	And I think with the kind of effort that can be marshaled, you can do amazing things.
232	Stephen Schwarman	And that's on behalf of Mike Corbat and myself who chaired the Partnership -- it's sort of trust, and gets rotated from person to person every two years.
233	Stephen Schwarman	I want to wish you really good luck with the Chinese.
234	Stephen Schwarman	That's an important thing, as we all know.
235	Stephen Schwarman	And I think there's a real opportunity to make progress with them.
236	Stephen Schwarman	And you should have a good time in Florida.
237	Stephen Schwarman	I hope the weather is good.
238	Donald Trump	Yeah, the weather will be beautiful.
239	Donald Trump	Thank you, Steve.
240	Donald Trump	I just want to finish by saying that we are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads over not eight years, over the last 20 and 25 years.
241	Donald Trump	You have regulations that are horrendous.
242	Donald Trump	Dodd-Frank is an example of what we're working on, and we're working on it right now.
243	Donald Trump	We're going to be coming out with some very strong -- far beyond recommendations -- we're going to be doing things that are going to be very good for the banking industry so that the banks can loan money to people that need it.
244	Donald Trump	I speak to people all the time.
245	Donald Trump	They used to borrow money from banks to open up -- there's one in Nevada -- to open up a pizza shop here, three shops -- he had a bank, and he said, you know -- at that time he called me "Mr. Trump" because I hadn't won yet -- but he said, "Mr. Trump, I can't open up anything; I can't do anything.
246	Donald Trump	The banks don't even -- I had a bank for 20 years; now they don't even take my phone call.
247	Donald Trump	And I was always a very good customer.
248	Donald Trump	So I haven't been able to do what I do."
249	Donald Trump	They can't do it.
250	Donald Trump	I mean, the banks got so restricted.
251	Donald Trump	And I've always said -- and some people get insulted -- but, you know, it's not necessarily the man that's making a lot of money that's running the bank.
252	Donald Trump	You look at the folks from government that are running all over the banks, they're running the banks.
253	Donald Trump	And the people that are really the head people, they're petrified of the regulators.
254	Donald Trump	They're petrified.
255	Donald Trump	They can't move.
256	Donald Trump	The regulators are running the banks.
257	Donald Trump	So we're going to do a very major haircut on Dodd-Frank.
258	Donald Trump	We want strong restrictions, we want strong regulation, but not regulation that makes it impossible for the banks to loan to people that are going to create jobs.
259	Donald Trump	But we're doing -- that's just one example.
260	Donald Trump	We're doing so many cuts on regulations.
261	Donald Trump	And we have a book on regulations, and if you add them all up, it goes up to the ceiling three times over.
262	Donald Trump	It's just one after another after another.
263	Donald Trump	It's just like that chart.
264	Donald Trump	I thought that chart was so descriptive.
265	Donald Trump	And every industry is just like that chart, and that's to build a simple roadway or highway that's what you have to go through.
266	Donald Trump	And we're going to be able to get rid of 90, 95 percent of that and still have the same kind of protection.
267	Donald Trump	And we want safety and we want environmental -- we want environmental protection.
268	Donald Trump	I've won awards on environmental protection.
269	Donald Trump	I'm a big believer, believe it or not.
270	Donald Trump	But we want that kind of protection.
271	Donald Trump	We want clean air and we want clean water, but we shouldn't have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing.
272	Donald Trump	So we have a country with tremendous potential.
273	Donald Trump	We have the greatest people on Earth, but we have to use that potential and we have to let those people do their thing.
274	Donald Trump	And with that, I just want to thank you all.
275	Donald Trump	I think you're going to see a very much different environment than you've been used to over the last, again, 20, 25 years.
276	Donald Trump	We're going to unleash the country.
277	Donald Trump	And I'm willing to take the heat, and that's okay.
278	Donald Trump	I've been taking the heat my whole life.
279	Donald Trump	But in the end, I know it's the right thing to do.
280	Donald Trump	And we're going to create a lot of jobs.
281	Donald Trump	We have 100 million people, if you look -- the real number is not 4.6 percent.
282	Donald Trump	They told me I had 4.6 percent last month, I'm doing great.
283	Donald Trump	I said, yeah, but what about the 100 million people.
284	Donald Trump	A lot of those people came out and voted for me.
285	Donald Trump	I call them the forgotten man, the forgotten woman.
286	Donald Trump	But a lot of those people, a good percentage of them, would like to have jobs, and they don't.
287	Donald Trump	One of the statistics that to me is just ridiculous -- so the 4.6 sounds good, but when you look for a job, you can't find it and you give up -- you are now considered statistically employed.
288	Donald Trump	But I don't consider those people employed.
289	Donald Trump	If you look at what's happened with Ford and with General Motors and with Fiat-Chrysler and so many other car companies, you see what they're doing back in Michigan and Ohio -- they were leaving.
290	Donald Trump	They were going to Mexico and many other places.
291	Donald Trump	They're now staying here.
292	Donald Trump	Now, I did say -- Reed knows this very well, because you've seen me say it many times to the big auto companies at meetings -- it's okay, enjoy your new plant; please send me a picture, I'm sure it's going to be lovely.
293	Donald Trump	But when you make your car or when you make your air conditioner, and you think you're going to fire all of our workers and open up a new place in another country, and you're going to come through what will be a very strong border, which is already -- you see what's happened; 61 percent down now in terms of illegal people coming in.
294	Donald Trump	Way, way down in terms of drugs pouring into our country and poisoning our youth.
295	Donald Trump	Way down.
296	Donald Trump	General Kelly has done a great job.
297	Donald Trump	But when you think you're going to sell that car or that air conditioner through our border, it's not going to happen.
298	Donald Trump	You're going to have a tax.
299	Donald Trump	And the tax may be 35 percent.
300	Donald Trump	And you know what, every single major company that I've had that conversation with has said, you know, we've decided to stay in the United States.
301	Donald Trump	It's amazing.
302	Donald Trump	And you would have thought they would have said this, frankly, for years.
303	Donald Trump	But nobody has ever said it.
304	Donald Trump	And we've lost close to 70,000 factories over a relatively short period of time -- 70,000.
305	Donald Trump	You wouldn't believe it's possible, Reed, to lose 70,000 factories -- 70,000.
306	Donald Trump	You know, you look at a map of the United States -- how many factories can you lose?
307	Donald Trump	We lost almost 70,000 factories.
308	Donald Trump	And I will tell you, that's not happening, because now they're staying here and they're all expanding here.
309	Donald Trump	Ford announced last week a massive expansion of three of its plants.
310	Donald Trump	That was not going to happen, believe me, if I didn't win.
311	Donald Trump	So, good luck, everybody.
312	Donald Trump	Enjoy yourselves.
313	Donald Trump	You're my friends.
314	Donald Trump	You're amazing people.
315	Donald Trump	And we're going to put you to work.
316	Donald Trump	Thank you.
