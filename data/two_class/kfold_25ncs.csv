1537,-3,0,"That uh - situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America."
8393,-3,0,"And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated."
28419,-3,0,"And secondly, we've had enough fighting."
3600,-3,0,I think those are pretty important priorities.
2829,-3,0,Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.
26844,-3,0,And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.
14488,-3,0,"And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more."
20851,-3,0,What I care about is children.
679,-3,0,We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.
17171,-3,0,"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying."
26669,-3,0,And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners.
2130,-3,0,It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.
5696,-3,0,"If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago."
23953,-3,0,I want to lead a unified country.
18642,-3,0,"So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to."
11665,-3,0,I thought that was a good model.
19891,-3,0,"I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life."
10710,-3,0,I know a lot of them that aren't working.
28776,-3,0,There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.
13870,-3,0,"But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better."
1601,-3,0,There are no magic answers to do it.
976,-3,0,And the best America is not behind us.
4236,-3,0,"So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally."
16530,-3,0,"Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs."
27263,-3,0,And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.
6898,-3,0,The government doesn't require you to do anything.
14610,-3,0,So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?
12691,-3,0,"Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala."
194,-3,0,I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.
7986,-3,0,"And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way."
24171,-3,0,"Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve."
21358,-3,0,And I'll tell you exactly why.
11282,-3,0,Let -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council.
34412,-3,0,"And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal."
24714,-3,0,"So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line."
1752,-3,0,But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.
13027,-3,0,And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.
24130,-3,0,"If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work."
26127,-3,0,"You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever."
6927,-3,0,It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.
17398,-3,0,"So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go."
28172,-3,0,And you need to know the record here.
10494,-3,0,"But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual."
11132,-3,0,"And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick."
5783,-3,0,"Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough."
34207,-3,0,"And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone."
27436,-3,0,We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.
27127,-3,0,"They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind."
23209,-3,0,"Like you, I'm concerned about the deficit."
32600,-3,0,"And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington."
12962,-3,0,Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.
27784,-3,0,"We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively."
20205,-3,0,We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.
25806,-3,0,"So this is, that's a good start."
13262,-3,0,"For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free."
1702,-3,0,"Number five, champion small business."
7540,-3,0,I'm asking for your vote.
10312,-3,0,"I want high wage, high skill jobs."
24529,-3,0,I'm very proud of him.
15101,-3,0,"What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?"
22184,-3,0,"And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union."
2226,-3,0,We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.
29562,-3,0,"Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be."
29893,-3,0,I got him to give the birth certificate.
11445,-3,0,That there is some resentment of U.S. power.
32985,-3,0,"I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody."
13155,-3,0,We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.
5594,-3,0,"Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes."
2083,-3,0,"Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools..."
25443,-3,0,"You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President."
5986,-3,0,It's mortgaging our children's future.
514,-3,0,I know what strong political leadership is.
12196,-3,0,"And secondly, I repeat to you --"
1232,-3,0,Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration.
25898,-3,0,I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank.
11063,-3,0,"If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act."
25480,-3,0,"I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable."
4109,-3,0,"But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe."
4156,-3,0,"Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it."
17963,-3,0,Our hearts go out to you.
7510,-3,0,"I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them."
2224,-3,0,The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?
13487,-3,0,"That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America."
5516,-3,0,And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.
7133,-3,0,"And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself."
32248,-3,0,We're going to block grant into the states.
15922,-3,0,"I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret."
383,-3,0,"Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States."
15630,-3,0,"(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature."
15760,-3,0,And that's the kind of America I want to build.
15402,-3,0,"So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future."
7521,-3,0,And he said this about it.
21257,-3,0,"Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families."
6114,-3,0,And you can go out and buy your own insurance.
18559,-3,0,"The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said."
17476,-3,0,This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.
23728,-3,0,I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.
4011,-3,0,"That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe."
265,-3,0,"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."
20413,-3,0,There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.
24090,-3,0,I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.
8878,-3,0,"That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities."
6723,-3,0,"As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts."
6625,-3,0,"No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job."
23041,-3,0,"Another is to pass -- to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they're working."
24988,-3,0,I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.
17029,-3,0,It was a glorious day.
3689,-3,0,I'm meeting folks all over the country.
12619,-3,0,Are we doing enough in that area?
29231,-3,0,"And that's a big, big factor."
20793,-3,0,We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.
28364,-3,0,"And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record."
26262,-3,0,The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm afraid it will end those extra effort programs.
6304,-3,0,"So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support."
11280,-3,0,"And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend."
12350,-3,0,"I apologize, Mr. Vice President."
28144,-3,0,"You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you."
13197,-3,0,"And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace."
21312,-3,0,"Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement."
15165,-3,0,"unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons."
19108,-3,0,"And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college."
12922,-3,0,"If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign."
15210,-3,0,That's one major war explosion in a warhead.
19966,-3,0,That's why we want an economic package.
19767,-3,0,It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.
19921,-3,0,It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.
15346,-3,0,"So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent."
6452,-3,0,We're proud to be here.
26401,-3,0,Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.
7427,-3,0,"And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together."
17204,-3,0,I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.
13442,-3,0,I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.
12235,-3,0,You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.
12467,-3,0,I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.
2301,-3,0,"Well, I would repeal and replace it."
3977,-3,0,So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.
1610,-3,0,And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.
28783,-3,0,"And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth."
9421,-3,0,It's critical to our future.
21361,-3,0,I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.
12591,-3,0,In 1957 I was in Havana.
29566,-3,0,"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health."
6529,-3,0,It's not working for the American family.
3928,-3,0,"It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed."
23628,-3,0,And I truly respect it.
15438,-3,0,There is a partnership involved in our nation.
12819,-3,0,There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.
22307,-3,0,I just want to mention if I could --
27604,-3,0,"And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father."
19941,-3,0,"I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together."
25927,-3,0,"Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be."
23495,-3,0,I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.
498,-3,0,But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.
15536,-3,0,"Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make."
16791,-3,0,"I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip."
11216,-3,0,"Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin."
17974,-3,0,"I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America."
1817,-3,0,But that -- that is not the case.
29559,-3,0,"So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?"
29390,-3,0,"So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look."
21921,-3,0,"But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you."
21425,-3,0,"Put it to you bluntly, American people."
28467,-3,0,"I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam."
8229,-3,0,I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.
3850,-3,0,But that's Senate inside baseball.
7847,-3,0,"Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work."
29846,-3,0,"And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well."
16289,-3,0,"That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there."
16349,-3,0,"Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative."
8524,-3,0,We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.
2631,-3,0,And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.
15046,-3,0,"The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place."
29324,-3,0,"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country."
14060,-3,0,And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.
29964,-3,0,"But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?"
24255,-3,0,"In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right."
15317,-3,0,That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.
21130,-3,0,Could we do another round on it?
13689,-3,0,"And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people."
29214,-3,0,"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement."
23100,-3,0,"We both believe that, as lawyers -- I'm a lawyer, too."
26359,-3,0,I know what it's like to be in a hospital.
16737,-3,0,Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.
10372,-3,0,I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.
16560,-3,0,"It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems."
14136,-3,0,"I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president."
22296,-3,0,I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.
26006,-3,0,"What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us."
25808,-3,0,"Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program."
30331,-3,0,We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...
29923,-3,0,"Well, it was very -- I say nothing."
28447,-3,0,It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.
29279,-3,0,"And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this."
13099,-3,0,"As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin."
14003,-3,0,"I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim."
11552,-3,0,I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.
3878,-3,0,We don't want our kids coming back here.
14811,-3,0,"And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security."
20333,-3,0,It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.
33593,-3,0,"I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty."
24143,-3,0,"And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs."
23951,-3,0,"I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it."
15965,-3,0,And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.
13322,-3,0,"Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate."
9650,-3,0,You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.
28273,-3,0,"We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through."
156,-3,0,It is that we are continuing to spend too much.
1174,-3,0,"The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president."
10576,-3,0,"My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis."
6177,-3,0,"Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated."
16860,-3,0,I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.
11938,-3,0,I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.
654,-3,0,"And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off."
24758,-3,0,Maybe we can work it out.
22619,-3,0,"And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction."
23439,-3,0,"The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan."
32903,-3,0,It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.
9358,-3,0,I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.
12429,-3,0,I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.
11419,-3,0,"It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us."
2389,-3,0,"If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all."
20935,-3,0,That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.
11999,-3,0,I think that measures like these are important.
24763,-3,0,"If you want to help somebody, don't run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he's afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him."
3742,-3,0,"How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs."
633,-3,0,"As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world."
2574,-3,0,The role of government: Look behind us.
19329,-3,0,But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.
27560,-3,0,"And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities."
3048,-3,0,"We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan."
29733,-3,0,And we have to be very vigilant.
7142,-3,0,What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.
6144,-3,0,"Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years."
3003,-3,0,We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.
508,-3,0,Let me just give you one other example.
25716,-3,0,I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.
18498,-3,0,"She and her son Bryan, they came to see me."
15433,-3,0,"The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision."
23200,-3,0,"Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession."
8240,-3,0,It is a question of which administration does the right thing.
15729,-3,0,We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.
33964,-3,0,I'd like to mention one thing.
9589,-3,0,"And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you."
12584,-3,0,The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?
6273,-3,0,"If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system."
13109,-3,0,This is the history of dealing with dictators.
8734,-3,0,"That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation."
27063,-3,0,"This -- what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition."
17584,-3,0,"Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest."
3184,-3,0,"But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio."
25034,-3,0,"We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power."
16558,-3,0,"There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects."
22193,-3,0,We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.
28558,-3,0,To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.
11879,-3,0,"I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children."
12775,-3,0,I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.
9688,-3,0,I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.
23838,-3,0,I think we've dramatically changed the world.
19375,-3,0,"You know, mine doesn't work that way."
10707,-3,0,"Well, Fiora (ph), I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate."
17042,-3,0,I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.
15713,-3,0,And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.
3959,-3,0,We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.
5688,-3,0,"We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president."
31847,-3,0,"Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American."
7921,-3,0,It's going to be a test of our strength.
19959,-3,0,"I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration."
3668,-3,0,"Look, it's just not true."
9809,-3,0,He hasn't done that either.
15271,-3,0,"As a matter of fact,."
4149,-3,0,And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.
10299,-3,0,"Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business."
7952,-3,0,In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.
6736,-3,0,I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
11014,-3,0,That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.

15963,-3,0,We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.
14182,-3,0,What should I have done?
132,-3,0,"There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin."
20097,-3,0,"You know, America's best days are ahead of us."
21481,-3,0,You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --
18217,-3,0,We didn't need that tax cut.
23720,-3,0,And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.
3660,-3,0,"Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code."
18466,-3,0,"I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president."
30229,-3,0,"No, they were taunting us."
23851,-3,0,"Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something."
19328,-3,0,I don't dislike trial lawyers.
23580,-3,0,"We've got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C."
21306,-3,0,"And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it."
11497,-3,0,"One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends."
33178,-3,0,"It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be."

18077,-3,0,I decided to go there myself.
32050,-3,0,Because you'd be in jail.
1826,-3,0,But let's get at the bottom line.
14198,-3,0,This was not a way to pay down the deficit.
32743,-3,0,How -- why would these people stay there?
25788,-3,0,Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.
11817,-3,0,And it's not an easy problem to solve.
19583,-3,0,That is my solemn obligation.
7176,-3,0,"What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?"
21466,-3,0,"Well, he raised the question of my father -- it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered."
13149,-3,0,There have been many wars in the history of mankind.
1785,-3,0,"And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car."
18486,-3,0,And I expect to win.
21814,-3,0,"Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools."
7455,-3,0,I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters.
11766,-3,0,I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.
24332,-3,0,There's no question about that.
27089,-3,0,This -- this is a critical opportunity for America.
32323,-3,0,This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.
28627,-3,0,Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.
1904,-3,0,Let me just make this comment.
20200,-3,0,"I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I'm happy to be here with Tipper and our family."
6845,-3,0,"People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system."
32752,-3,0,"General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East."
22932,-3,0,Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone.
19786,-3,0,I think this election has to be geared toward the future.
5491,-3,0,"Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry."
3180,-3,0,Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.
19198,-3,0,"We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation."
15490,-3,0,"We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere."
20238,-3,0,And let me give you an example of what I mean.
22236,-3,0,"And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children."
32268,-3,0,"If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center."
26589,-3,0,And people have to decide.
6493,-3,0,But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.
3902,-3,0,"The question is, was this wise?"
14197,-3,0,Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.
6883,-3,0,And I'm very proud of that.
20491,-3,0,"As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life."
22134,-3,0,So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.
26642,-3,0,We took it out of politics.
2743,-3,0,There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.
2173,-3,0,They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.
4202,-3,0,But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.
6462,-3,0,The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?
1010,-3,0,"And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years."
28746,-3,0,I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.
12389,-3,0,"Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't."
18901,-3,0,"And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it."
22691,-3,0,"Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent."
9625,-3,0,"But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible."
5832,-3,0,"Well, let me just say I would..."
18974,-3,0,I regret what's happened in these past months.
12981,-3,0,"And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."
4053,-3,0,"A testimony to you, Jim."
28923,-3,0,"If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy."
34355,-3,0,We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.
7993,-3,0,Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.
28185,-3,0,It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.
24433,-3,0,"It's very important that we not just, without thinking it through, just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces."
29817,-3,0,"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off."
9080,-3,0,"It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes."
29392,-3,0,"And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see."
22165,-3,0,"That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy."
29499,-3,0,And we better be awfully careful.
32342,-3,0,How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?
26196,-3,0,My whole administration is about your future.
3681,-3,0,We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.
29130,-3,0,They're going to many other countries.
21666,-3,0,"Let me say in my case, if I'm out of work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage."
22206,-3,0,"So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools."
27589,-3,0,"Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map."
24756,-3,0,"The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it's easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled."
5797,-3,0,"But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America."
20961,-3,0,"It was about emergencies, wasn't it?"
13275,-3,0,"Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu."
22893,-3,0,"In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with."
7744,-3,0,Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.
16199,-3,0,"George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill."
949,-3,0,I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.
2855,-3,0,We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.
19351,-3,0,"We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party."
33484,-3,0,So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.
9468,-3,0,"It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country."
26733,-3,0,"It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities."
19103,-3,0,Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.
5623,-3,0,"Programs that we need, we should make them work better."
14449,-3,0,"Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster."
4271,-3,0,And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.
1269,-3,0,We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.
27751,-3,0,"We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible."
24285,-3,0,And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.
16927,-3,0,I might go back to one other thing.
17471,-3,0,"Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life."
16988,-3,0,But I think it's time to talk about the future.
4019,-3,0,"This was last August, a year ago."
32563,-3,0,She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.
16466,-3,0,We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.
20083,-3,0,We just see the world in different ways.
18626,-3,0,"I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops."
13909,-3,0,"Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem."
2759,-3,0,The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.
24961,-3,0,"I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier."
17036,-3,0,The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.
15968,-3,0,"The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this."
23899,-3,0,I think the American people should be the judge of that.
17422,-3,0,That's where government should not be.
21925,-3,0,"Well, I think the national debt affects everybody."
15413,-3,0,"First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible."
7912,-3,0,"So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda."
16497,-3,0,"And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval."
12960,-3,0,"I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business."
22713,-3,0,And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections.
20554,-3,0,I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.
8295,-3,0,The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.
26175,-3,0,My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.
3602,-3,0,But let's go back to the original point.
28112,-3,0,"The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C."
15381,-3,0,Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.
25205,-3,0,Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?
26511,-3,0,"It was a big, big mistake."
17570,-3,0,"As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing."
23573,-3,0,I think that's an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.
22349,-3,0,You weren't impressed with the fact that he --
15866,-3,0,"And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings."
266,-3,0,"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""
8150,-3,0,"A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so."
23571,-3,0,"Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick."
15440,-3,0,I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.
27232,-3,0,But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.
6905,-3,0,Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.
25775,-3,0,They were presidents at historic times.
28404,-3,0,"If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man."
3790,-3,0,On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.
26925,-3,0,And that's what we've done over the last four years.
7470,-3,0,There was only four of us there.
19976,-3,0,"So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent."
27296,-3,0,... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.
15258,-3,0,"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position."
18157,-3,0,"No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined."
171,-3,0,"We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen."
1209,-3,0,But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.
25856,-3,0,"Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else."
21261,-3,0,And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you.
18844,-3,0,"Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world."
2195,-3,0,"And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse."
10931,-3,0,So here's what I would do.
12973,-3,0,We can no longer afford to be second best.
21748,-3,0,"And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one."
20657,-3,0,The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.
25968,-3,0,"Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it."
18210,-3,0,"But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense."
19624,-3,0,And I hope that will happen.
15408,-3,0,And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.
11402,-3,0,Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.
3994,-3,0,And we've got a choice.
11331,-3,0,"Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country."
12948,-3,0,I served it uh - in the war.
1060,-3,0,"I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people."
23250,-3,0,Do you know what he presented us with?
10942,-3,0,"He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit."
19834,-3,0,"Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices."
27085,-3,0,"We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties."
8022,-3,0,It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.
16537,-3,0,"And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War."
652,-3,0,Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.
25235,-3,0,You must be tough and smart.
6119,-3,0,"And this is your plan, John."
9067,-3,0,"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties."
4280,-3,0,That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.
32810,-3,0,Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.
29772,-3,0,"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective."
27492,-3,0,"There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established."
19151,-3,0,We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.
8325,-3,0,And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.
10978,-3,0,We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.
18661,-3,0,Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.
4216,-3,0,And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.
18843,-3,0,"But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president."
1584,-3,0,Employment ought to be restored to our people.
24835,-3,0,You have to make tough calls.
23894,-3,0,"So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts."
28896,-3,0,"No, I'm not proud of that."
15774,-3,0,You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.
34287,-3,0,"And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting."
18026,-3,0,That's why they're fighting so vociferously.
3496,-3,0,"But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that."
17878,-3,0,I think we've given the American people back their spirit.
23509,-3,0,"And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper."
6658,-3,0,"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?"
1425,-3,0,But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.
4359,-3,0,And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.
186,-3,0,But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.
7978,-3,0,I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.
9283,-3,0,I was in coal country.
16807,-3,0,It shows a lack of leadership.
8056,-3,0,Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.
18706,-3,0,"My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure."
13814,-3,0,Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?
17347,-3,0,My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.
19957,-3,0,"Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern."
3325,-3,0,Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.
5726,-3,0,I support clean coal technology.
13752,-3,0,"And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board."
18429,-3,0,And I'll tell you exactly how.
15416,-3,0,I've been President now for almost four years.
2703,-3,0,"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."
14418,-3,0,But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.
6673,-3,0,They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.
29894,-3,0,So I'm satisfied with it.
24428,-3,0,"Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy."
153,-3,0,I would like a balanced budget amendment.
8905,-3,0,"I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild."
107,-3,0,"First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford."
4114,-3,0,It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.
8879,-3,0,"In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country."
18939,-3,0,"I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea."
13597,-3,0,I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.
11952,-3,0,"I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people."
22363,-3,0,"No, I think you'll see --"
33536,-3,0,She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.
241,-3,0,We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.
4046,-3,0,But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.
6132,-3,0,"I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability."
19421,-3,0,"Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President."
15193,-3,0,"In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly."
11976,-3,0,And I think that's the way it ought to be.
25531,-3,0,But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.
24142,-3,0,"Now, we can do better."
6247,-3,0,"Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama."
3770,-3,0,I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.
22994,-3,0,"No, but he's for weakening it."
21565,-3,0,I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.
15758,-3,0,But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.
1250,-3,0,"Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care."
18187,-3,0,And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.
17845,-3,0,"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''"
11763,-3,0,I just want to make sure the return is good.
13508,-3,0,"Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige."
15785,-3,0,But there are many people who I admire in this country today.
7631,-3,0,I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.
24471,-3,0,And there's a whole bunch of other things that I can't click off in this short period of time.
24819,-3,0,And I'd like to thank those of you who are watching.
16850,-3,0,"But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone."
24198,-3,0,"Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who've been in meetings when I would sit there and say, ""Is this the one we're going to talk about or do something about?"""
17130,-3,0,Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.
19695,-3,0,We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.
34419,-3,0,I have a plan for doing that.
21117,-3,0,"It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt."
14461,-3,0,"But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation."
27171,-3,0,But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.
27961,-3,0,"And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices."
18506,-3,0,"And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom."
22161,-3,0,Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.
14739,-3,0,"I need your support, I ask for your vote."
9547,-3,0,"If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up."
32882,-3,0,... but we believed that we could make the country better.
29146,-3,0,"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later."
24219,-3,0,"What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together."
31920,-3,0,We're going to make America safe again.
26753,-3,0,"We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral."
6078,-3,0,We need to have walk-in clinics.
12924,-3,0,"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955."
16886,-3,0,It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.
19499,-3,0,"Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President."
23995,-3,0,And so I just have a different approach.
3974,-3,0,And it's going to be tough.
20982,-3,0,I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.
17279,-3,0,I have a deep religious faith.
19607,-3,0,"And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President."
26008,-3,0,And we will do that.
19349,-3,0,That's why we need campaign finance reform.
14064,-3,0,We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.
8412,-3,0,I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.
8067,-3,0,Now that means the best leadership.
26637,-3,0,Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.
8209,-3,0,What's the net result of this?
13159,-3,0,"If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves."
7786,-3,0,And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.
16780,-3,0,"These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people."
34,-3,0,"But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools."
6197,-3,0,"But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision."
4386,-3,0,That's been missing over the last eight years.
11559,-3,0,It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.
18038,-3,0,And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.
13090,-3,0,"I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war."
1345,-3,0,If we make the use of a gun in the commission.
3499,-3,0,You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.
26313,-3,0,"But I must say I'm a little offended by this word ""scheme."""
19894,-3,0,"Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help."
23696,-3,0,"I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them."
13212,-3,0,"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""
25468,-3,0,The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.
22762,-3,0,"I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country."
27479,-3,0,"Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that."
17980,-3,0,"I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot."
797,-3,0,I still have a couple of minutes left.
20746,-3,0,Those are very clear differences.
25144,-3,0,"Groucho Marx said, ""Who do you believe?"
12778,-3,0,"And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed."
9520,-3,0,"Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America."
9284,-3,0,"People grabbed my arms and said, ""Please save my job."""
22332,-3,0,"And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time."
3696,-3,0,"And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities."
7507,-3,0,"Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love."
15821,-3,0,"say, he is our hero."
15205,-3,0,"I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was."
17186,-3,0,And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.
907,-3,0,"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future."
14127,-3,0,"Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen."
28036,-3,0,"Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses."
19922,-3,0,And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.
19107,-3,0,Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.
11403,-3,0,I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.
1005,-3,0,"Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces."
14032,-3,0,And it goes on and on.
23972,-3,0,We've got to have no more trickle down.
25197,-3,0,"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''"
20680,-3,0,It's one of the major priorities of my administration.
8718,-3,0,"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself."
23970,-3,0,"In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people."
1065,-3,0,"We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people."
11364,-3,0,"It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years."
19743,-3,0,But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.
8570,-3,0,"First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth."
27979,-3,0,I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.
13166,-3,0,It's a question of who they are.
32566,-3,0,"And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment."
3264,-3,0,I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.
21260,-3,0,You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.
20862,-3,0,"We've got to recruit 100,000 new teachers."
8893,-3,0,"I stood there, and I met the people."
21627,-3,0,"This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country."
14934,-3,0,We have inflation because the Government is living too well.
2229,-3,0,"This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality."
13020,-3,0,"What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side."
8728,-3,0,"We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest."
24344,-3,0,"But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture."
13010,-3,0,But let's look at it.
24207,-3,0,"Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit."
7069,-3,0,"After all, I was a border governor for a while."
29042,-3,0,You ain't seen nothing yet.
11037,-3,0,"And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges."
22694,-3,0,"Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee."
15607,-3,0,I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.
29286,-3,0,You can't bring back jobs.
33554,-3,0,We are spending a fortune doing it.
25777,-3,0,It's important we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future.
29022,-3,0,"Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform."
15644,-3,0,I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.
24138,-3,0,"So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant."
382,-3,0,The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.
1477,-3,0,It's probably the worst one of all.
11071,-3,0,"We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead."
1692,-3,0,"Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich."
22006,-3,0,And that is very important.
28769,-3,0,I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way.
27198,-3,0,They don't vote for war.
27115,-3,0,I don't anticipate that in the future.
19780,-3,0,And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.
25815,-3,0,"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it."""
3175,-3,0,And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.
3828,-3,0,But we have to use our military wisely.
11145,-3,0,It'd be fine with me.
24403,-3,0,"Ann, both of them are very complicated situations."
29043,-3,0,And I will keep that promise.
11094,-3,0,And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda.
10475,-3,0,"As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes."
34428,-3,0,"We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition."
18004,-3,0,I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made.
7209,-3,0,He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language?
9487,-3,0,It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.
20058,-3,0,So I'd rather talk about my strengths.
8072,-3,0,"I think the people should put America first, rather than party first."
13639,-3,0,We've got to pay it back.
24669,-3,0,They will want to do what's good for our country.
23079,-3,0,I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.
14486,-3,0,The debt and the deficit.
5763,-3,0,"When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas."
7793,-3,0,I think that we could not afford not to do these things.
28165,-3,0,"Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all."
15460,-3,0,I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.
17310,-3,0,"I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there."
19919,-3,0,"And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race."
9191,-3,0,"And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time."
25626,-3,0,I remember driving down the California coast one day.
630,-3,0,And I think I've had that.
14262,-3,0,"My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media."
22990,-3,0,That's why the Patriot Act was important.
34208,-3,0,"If you think that was good, then you do."
18735,-3,0,"He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message."
4361,-3,0,And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.
99,-3,0,And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.
2918,-3,0,But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.
11658,-3,0,"Well, I understand, and Africa is important."
12346,-3,0,"That's an interruption, by the way."
21952,-3,0,Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.
23059,-3,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again."
10723,-3,0,"We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together."
26311,-3,0,That's the problem with it.
28038,-3,0,"Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family."
18625,-3,0,"But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us."
3769,-3,0,"Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan."
15008,-3,0,"And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people."
563,-3,0,"It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us."
16407,-3,0,"And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth."
2859,-3,0,The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.
26693,-3,0,I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.
19480,-3,0,"And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it."
2893,-3,0,"And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations."
4396,-3,0,And I'll take care of them.
12567,-3,0,To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.
24364,-3,0,"If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China."
34457,-3,0,"We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now."
6135,-3,0,This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.
22859,-3,0,"Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran."
3579,-3,0,Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money.
15251,-3,0,"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country."
24968,-3,0,"So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record."
26975,-3,0,"And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul."
18120,-3,0,They just need the help to be trained.
1244,-3,0,"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead."""
19500,-3,0,Talking about this and this.
21834,-3,0,I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.
16338,-3,0,"Look, we need the highest possible ethical standards."
14571,-3,0,But I can tell you this.
25069,-3,0,"[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union."
29355,-3,0,"But in -- oh, but I do."
23942,-3,0,Ross gave a good answer but I've got to respond directly to Mr. Bush.
20610,-3,0,And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.
10442,-3,0,It hasn't worked out that way.
8480,-3,0,It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.
1394,-3,0,"Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit."
1058,-3,0,"If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy."
10082,-3,0,"It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?"
23035,-3,0,And that's why we're doing what we're doing.
15690,-3,0,"But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues."
15843,-3,0,"And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement."
11251,-3,0,Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.
14511,-3,0,We've turned the country upside down.
13968,-3,0,"I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy."
1243,-3,0,"This has not been done, unfortunately."
16997,-3,0,It needs to be competent.
15770,-3,0,"And thank God, the freeze people were not heard."
7800,-3,0,Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.
13432,-3,0,Many say four and a half per cent.
24414,-3,0,"That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator."
27220,-3,0,"We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy."
24187,-3,0,"The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that."
8532,-3,0,"We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States."
24244,-3,0,"Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound."
20320,-3,0,"And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options."
12881,-3,0,They want to be free.
10687,-3,0,So that would be priority number one.
8441,-3,0,The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.
8684,-3,0,You are robbing the American people of their savings.
6735,-3,0,"But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage."
25597,-3,0,"And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children."
23482,-3,0,"As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that."
29857,-3,0,I'd just like to respond.
19317,-3,0,Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.
20173,-3,0,"I ask for your support, I ask for your help."
1917,-3,0,And we talk about evidence.
24521,-3,0,"We've got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day, and we don't have the will to stamp it out."
19915,-3,0,I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.
20538,-3,0,That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.
12032,-3,0,"like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --"
27338,-3,0,"To the extent humanly possible, we get that out."
24280,-3,0,"Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower."
13335,-3,0,We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.
16368,-3,0,"28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles."
18148,-3,0,Can I respond to that?
3593,-3,0,I want to cut spending.
25914,-3,0,I think we need to go back and take a look.
19956,-3,0,"Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record."
22835,-3,0,"I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee."
32489,-3,0,We are going to be thriving again.
7971,-3,0,And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?
30364,-3,0,And I don't believe she does have the stamina.
23873,-3,0,"I don't believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him."
7344,-3,0,I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.
6700,-3,0,"And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want."
23377,-3,0,They're going backwards on the definition for wetlands.
17685,-3,0,There is no question that the poor are worse off.
2100,-3,0,"I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?"
15632,-3,0,"I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way."
32910,-3,0,"... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times."
12639,-3,0,I have seen us ignore Africa.
15423,-3,0,I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.
11678,-3,0,I think we have to be very reticent about that.
11130,-3,0,And that is to get the support of the people.
28381,-3,0,It's just the right position to take.
25378,-3,0,But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?
10967,-3,0,"I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit."
16797,-3,0,He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.
24849,-3,0,And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.
12550,-3,0,We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace.
25068,-3,0,"Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense."
13351,-3,0,"But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do."
13126,-3,0,I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.
23370,-3,0,"Labels don't fit, ladies and gentlemen."
13393,-3,0,"I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly."
20841,-3,0,Here is the role of the federal government.
638,-3,0,"He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don't need and can't afford."
19374,-3,0,It seems to me that you have a selective memory.
21887,-3,0,"I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you."
16747,-3,0,If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.
20859,-3,0,"Every school and every school district, have every state test the children."
25595,-3,0,"I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health."
8719,-3,0,"Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it."
1361,-3,0,You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.
13899,-3,0,That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.
20082,-3,0,"And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other."
9275,-3,0,"The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have."
27915,-3,0,What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.
29666,-3,0,And that's what I do.
19852,-3,0,"Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association."
7698,-3,0,There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.
30338,-3,0,I will go very quickly.
22888,-3,0,"An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world."
18944,-3,0,"It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons."
792,-3,0,"And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record."
2221,-3,0,I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.
20458,-3,0,I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.
1484,-3,0,"Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened."
715,-3,0,That's-at least that's what I read.
33811,-3,0,She's going to get rid of nobody.
620,-3,0,"These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference."
3498,-3,0,But there's also the issue of responsibility.
21869,-3,0,"You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it's organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they're working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls."
23716,-3,0,"And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse."
13647,-3,0,"I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into."
30167,-3,0,"I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity."
20558,-3,0,I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.
24264,-3,0,"We live in a global economy, not a national economy."
21534,-3,0,I think it depends how you define it.
21470,-3,0,That says something about character.
1124,-3,0,"I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose."
28246,-3,0,"It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms."
27698,-3,0,"Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?"
19507,-3,0,Look at where we are today.
15605,-3,0,"(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful."
5807,-3,0,"Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around."
25286,-3,0,"I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed."
26839,-3,0,"Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you're on your own?"
21817,-3,0,I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.
14297,-3,0,You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.
11289,-3,0,"What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?"
5791,-3,0,"The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks."
27769,-3,0,"That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs."
5505,-3,0,It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.
5517,-3,0,But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.
20805,-3,0,Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.
6966,-3,0,We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.
24760,-3,0,Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.
10335,-3,0,"In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am."
2220,-3,0,I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.
22026,-3,0,"Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus."
18238,-3,0,And I hope it's as soon as possible.
33653,-3,0,We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...
22441,-3,0,"Sure, you can do that with Congress."
19464,-3,0,"You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo."
14264,-3,0,And I just had to work that in.
21883,-3,0,"Now, you've got to have a government that comes from you again."
8063,-3,0,"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""
2064,-3,0,"Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas."
28965,-3,0,"(LAUGHTER) I -- there's an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end."
21849,-3,0,So I want to keep the quality of health care.
19614,-3,0,"They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation."
827,-3,0,"If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages."
8179,-3,0,"Where, then, do we disagree?"
23556,-3,0,"And when I am president, I'm going to do it because we have to."
30327,-3,0,Can they rely on us?
23510,-3,0,Now that's not a flip-flop.
20265,-3,0,"And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I."
11926,-3,0,"I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version."
26771,-3,0,"We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability."
11409,-3,0,I've been able to set clear goals.
20078,-3,0,A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.
13132,-3,0,"Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa."
14411,-3,0,Nobody did any of this with evil intent.
6940,-3,0,Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.
3441,-3,0,"That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight."
16670,-3,0,"We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates."
13664,-3,0,"Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?"
33148,-3,0,"And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy."
16139,-3,0,"Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that."
17693,-3,0,That's another reason to get the deficit down.
7831,-3,0,This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.
23866,-3,0,The same old experience is not relevant.
28116,-3,0,That's part of an overall overhaul.
19618,-3,0,Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.
1569,-3,0,A lot remains to be done.
33556,-3,0,"All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places."
32363,-3,0,She just went about 25 seconds over her time.
29908,-3,0,"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course."
18495,-3,0,"You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife."
24438,-3,0,The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.
29025,-3,0,I have kept the faith.
29949,-3,0,"First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama."
25607,-3,0,"But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made."
1007,-3,0,The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.
12470,-3,0,I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.
19923,-3,0,The American people should make up their own mind.
19995,-3,0,"You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past."
22334,-3,0,"This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy."
23875,-3,0,"Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is."
1304,-3,0,It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.
23834,-3,0,I want to bring that change to the American people.
85,-3,0,"I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country."
22948,-3,0,And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.
28707,-3,0,Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have.
539,-3,0,They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.
16531,-3,0,Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.
27123,-3,0,This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.
19167,-3,0,"But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries."
17224,-3,0,"Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover."
14705,-3,0,"I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country."
10530,-3,0,"Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing."
28979,-3,0,"And that's what we need, I think, in this election."
8861,-3,0,The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.
18311,-3,0,They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.
8008,-3,0,I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.
3309,-3,0,This is uh - what the American people want.
13350,-3,0,This is a difficult and sensitive matter.
20928,-3,0,"See, here is the mentality."
7393,-3,0,"And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being."
29470,-3,0,The first I've -- who gave it that name?
16020,-3,0,"Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to."
9038,-3,0,And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.
30185,-3,0,It's going to destabilize the Middle East.
6185,-3,0,And not legislating from the bench.
24530,-3,0,But I can tell you this.
12592,-3,0,I talked to the American Ambassador there.
12873,-3,0,"Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world."
22249,-3,0,"Now, as long as we put up with that, that's what you're going to get."
26978,-3,0,They don't happen to be accurate.
3369,-3,0,"I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps."
21382,-3,0,I'd like the government to have that.
8450,-3,0,That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.
28626,-3,0,I'm for research and development.
24144,-3,0,I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.
11994,-3,0,I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.
163,-3,0,"And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts."
11237,-3,0,But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.
16271,-3,0,"That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make."
24162,-3,0,"I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later."
25094,-3,0,"We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us."
20147,-3,0,And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.
30414,-3,0,Let me just tell you...
24016,-3,0,"If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant."
13636,-3,0,And we are bleeding arterially.
11983,-3,0,"Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed."
21417,-3,0,And what's happened in the meantime?
32766,-3,0,"Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate..."
34451,-3,0,Our inner cities are a disaster.
29933,-3,0,"Well, just listen to what you heard."
25227,-3,0,A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.
29479,-3,0,"... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down."
20872,-3,0,His name is Randy Ellis.
15196,-3,0,"I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying, with what I have said or what my positions are."
18866,-3,0,But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.
18191,-3,0,And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.
7757,-3,0,"Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well."
1566,-3,0,But our country is innately very strong.
34458,-3,0,"We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her."
11581,-3,0,I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.
11113,-3,0,We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.
3635,-3,0,It's not like you want to close the loopholes.
24059,-3,0,"I don't think we need 150,000 troops."
1778,-3,0,So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.
16131,-3,0,It's a contract between generations.
11944,-3,0,"I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view."
17187,-3,0,I am answering your questions.
3084,-3,0,"And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies."
28421,-3,0,You talk about eight years?
15188,-3,0,"If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition."
7061,-3,0,I see it as a serious problem.
2974,-3,0,We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public.
21745,-3,0,"This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America."
16996,-3,0,I believe in our country.
8602,-3,0,"I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction."
21310,-3,0,You've got a mature workforce.
15488,-3,0,"We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs."
8322,-3,0,I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.
15776,-3,0,And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.
33031,-3,0,There is a thing called clean coal.
19465,-3,0,"If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street."
27497,-3,0,And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.
10560,-3,0,"What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?"
20350,-3,0,Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.
15802,-3,0,"In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models."
6526,-3,0,"But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot."
17363,-3,0,They want the equal rights amendment ratified.
1839,-3,0,"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""
755,-3,0,"Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages."
12631,-3,0,And that's what concerns me.
27908,-3,0,That will not help us compete with China.
13996,-3,0,"I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes."
15900,-3,0,I know others disagree with it.
33371,-3,0,We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.
33445,-3,0,Those are the questions we need answered.
13107,-3,0,"But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States."
29385,-3,0,That can't -- that can't be left to stand.
1357,-3,0,And uh - the individuals that uh - with whom I've consulted have not uh - convinced me that uh - a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about.
30230,-3,0,... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.
16359,-3,0,"And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards we'll set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people we're looking for."
16186,-3,0,I'm not going to do that.
29175,-3,0,"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit."
24667,-3,0,I will have a unique mandate.
1507,-3,0,"And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment."
12723,-3,0,This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.
4159,-3,0,"And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies."
24010,-3,0,And that's about all I can say in a minute.
26077,-3,0,"Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work."
19049,-3,0,And we'll continue to spread freedom.
28424,-3,0,"Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim."
1019,-3,0,I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.
20262,-3,0,I take him for his word.
22121,-3,0,"So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation."
8596,-3,0,And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.
24504,-3,0,"I'll tell the American people, but this man said I'll get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising, something that's very hard for the government to do."
25951,-3,0,Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.
11913,-3,0,I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.
15897,-3,0,And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.
18118,-3,0,"He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people."
13838,-3,0,"At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares."
19910,-3,0,But this is a very liberal administration.
6072,-3,0,And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.
14326,-3,0,"I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table."
11720,-3,0,I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.
7739,-3,0,"Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one."
11004,-3,0,Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.
433,-3,0,I don't think most people do.
16254,-3,0,I think a great many of them have come out today.
11407,-3,0,He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.
31909,-3,0,Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
25382,-3,0,I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.
11360,-3,0,That's what America's all about.
34212,-3,0,"Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president."
26643,-3,0,people get so tired of politics.
13940,-3,0,"No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base."
1118,-3,0,"I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality."
15629,-3,0,I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.
25065,-3,0,"Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate."
25978,-3,0,"We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it."
1239,-3,0,"Yes, I'd be glad to."
7285,-3,0,Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.
27987,-3,0,I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.
24704,-3,0,"When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy."
22558,-3,0,"I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things."
7029,-3,0,He talks about middle-class tax cuts.
6449,-3,0,"Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight."
24347,-3,0,And we're going to keep on doing that.
4004,-3,0,"But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record."
16613,-3,0,I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.
29715,-3,0,"You walk down the street, you get shot."
23447,-3,0,"And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here."
7896,-3,0,I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.
23856,-3,0,"You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result."
29378,-3,0,"And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation."
2629,-3,0,"And we said, ""Why not cut out the middleman?"""
1542,-3,0,"What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth."
30303,-3,0,And they're going to end up getting nuclear.
23264,-3,0,I have a tax cut.
16346,-3,0,And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.
18381,-3,0,I get the casualty reports every day.
14220,-3,0,I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.
22712,-3,0,He came to see me.
12957,-3,0,We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important.
32149,-3,0,"No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary."
19882,-3,0,You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.
11754,-3,0,"I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid."
27904,-3,0,People will look it up.
8211,-3,0,"Now, this is not standing still."
591,-3,0,But I'll tell you what I was thinking of.
26415,-3,0,"We're going to grow some of these jobs in America, because we need to get it -- they're going the wrong way."
24038,-3,0,"If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good."
1186,-3,0,"And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees."
20509,-3,0,"First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk."
8188,-3,0,Is the United States standing still?
25167,-3,0,"We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken."
29805,-3,0,They've got a lot of concerns.
9175,-3,0,"I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here."
11447,-3,0,But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.
24310,-3,0,And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.
14037,-3,0,I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.
16541,-3,0,It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.
2004,-3,0,You've been president four years.
16098,-3,0,"I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more."
20504,-3,0,I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.
26451,-3,0,"I believe that any law- abiding, tax-paying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn't break the law and doesn't interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn't be subject to unfair discrimination."
18832,-3,0,Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.
10975,-3,0,Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.
24853,-3,0,We don't need to do that any more.
6293,-3,0,We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.
2473,-3,0,"But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families."
25488,-3,0,"In other words, we've got to be tough."
25611,-3,0,"When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world."
17580,-3,0,"Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed."
5821,-3,0,"I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate."
25232,-3,0,That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief.
23906,-3,0,It's a question of character and judgment.
18101,-3,0,Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.
15450,-3,0,Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?
781,-3,0,Are we closer to peace?
20076,-3,0,"Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work."
18936,-3,0,"Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation."
21543,-3,0,That's not specific in terms of a program.
10695,-3,0,"I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper."
1808,-3,0,"So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not."
8167,-3,0,The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?
27815,-3,0,My dad was head of a car company.
11120,-3,0,"In fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan."
18745,-3,0,"I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes."
22016,-3,0,And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.
16362,-3,0,I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.
17874,-3,0,"And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons."
8619,-3,0,"If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us."
21263,-3,0,"I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way."
20908,-3,0,"Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim."
27926,-3,0,I've met some of those people.
21857,-3,0,I think it's a good program.
13488,-3,0,The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.
13226,-3,0,"But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner."
6936,-3,0,"Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital."
34205,-3,0,"And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment."
12240,-3,0,We have to be bold.
21084,-3,0,A promise made will be a promise kept.
34107,-3,0,"So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS."
2096,-3,0,"But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table."
19318,-3,0,That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.
12893,-3,0,"Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had."
22369,-3,0,I hope a lot of --
3295,-3,0,Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.
8018,-3,0,I believe that we should defend Formosa.
16572,-3,0,Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.
33341,-3,0,"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life."
24212,-3,0,Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.
27714,-3,0,But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.
25251,-3,0,And let's talk about people we do control.
26681,-3,0,"Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy."
10298,-3,0,"We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one."
15798,-3,0,"Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support."
617,-3,0,Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?
24329,-3,0,"Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military."
19951,-3,0,Their budget weakened our support for education.
8912,-3,0,"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver."
11277,-3,0,"Well, thank you, Terry (ph)."
11324,-3,0,"And most of the time, I learn it by asking her."
2705,-3,0,"And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?"
21686,-3,0,"I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it."
28324,-3,0,We need to have accountability.
12888,-3,0,"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his."
8157,-3,0,We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.
24776,-3,0,"Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious."
16442,-3,0,"First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs."
24242,-3,0,Give me a chance to do that.
7694,-3,0,"Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor."
4157,-3,0,This is a mischaracterization of my position.
19937,-3,0,"I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about."
9862,-3,0,"But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants."
28991,-3,0,There was a chance to get this done.
722,-3,0,"The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready."
21226,-3,0,Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.
25399,-3,0,And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.
12903,-3,0,I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.
11873,-3,0,"And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated."
13341,-3,0,I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.
3777,-3,0,"We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover."
10094,-3,0,It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.
6665,-3,0,I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.
21872,-3,0,The facts are you now have a government that comes at you.
29599,-3,0,It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.
21719,-3,0,"I am for the right, as the governor says- -I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons."
12553,-3,0,It can and will grow even more in the next four.
28571,-3,0,They're aimed at the real problem.
25077,-3,0,"I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need."
19296,-3,0,"I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is."
16722,-3,0,"There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops."
19766,-3,0,"And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it."
34335,-3,0,We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.
26533,-3,0,I think that would help.
18273,-3,0,"I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right."
15430,-3,0,"But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50."
22953,-3,0,"Thank you very much, Ann."
19733,-3,0,I want to be very serious.
27342,-3,0,"I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it."
2626,-3,0,Let me just say one final example.
15878,-3,0,I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.
11302,-3,0,And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.
22856,-3,0,It's naive and dangerous to say that.
17721,-3,0,There's no way of glossing around that.
23558,-3,0,Let me make sure you understand my decision.
25245,-3,0,I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.
15043,-3,0,To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.
11706,-3,0,I would very much like to get our troops out of there.
226,-3,0,Let me say this about AIDS.
2305,-3,0,"You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for..."
16831,-3,0,"And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em."
7665,-3,0,"I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together."
14647,-3,0,And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.
23684,-3,0,"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?"""
6110,-3,0,"If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described."
33368,-3,0,I think I should respond to that.
28396,-3,0,Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.
16902,-3,0,We will make some gains in the United States Senate.
7018,-3,0,And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.
7924,-3,0,"I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas."
29182,-3,0,"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow."
7713,-3,0,I would hope an incident like that would not happen.
9014,-3,0,I believe in freedom of choice.
12912,-3,0,"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us."
32973,-3,0,I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.
13270,-3,0,"U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success."
16903,-3,0,"So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress."
18331,-3,0,And we support the U.N. efforts there.
12365,-3,0,I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.
18471,-3,0,And that's not how a commander in chief acts.
13761,-3,0,But I don't think it's fair.
3059,-3,0,"There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel."
29870,-3,0,"But I will tell you, I've been all over."
26822,-3,0,And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.
7072,-3,0,"If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families."
7984,-3,0,It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.
22435,-3,0,"If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man."
2032,-3,0,"Well, we've had this discussion before."
21985,-3,0,"I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again."
28683,-3,0,"Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying."
23046,-3,0,"Medicare -- the issue of Medicare used to be called ""Mediscare."""
8695,-3,0,"I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that."
20940,-3,0,"Start asking the question, what do you know?"
23895,-3,0,"If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man."
24852,-3,0,"On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people -- not change for the sake of change, tax and spend."
17424,-3,0,"Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States."
25011,-3,0,Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.
285,-3,0,"I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry."
15716,-3,0,"We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now."
32921,-3,0,It's a very effective way of communication.
18796,-3,0,They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.
29827,-3,0,Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.
24363,-3,0,Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.
12840,-3,0,"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say."
16040,-3,0,"Secondly, I don't have any litmus test."
25813,-3,0,"Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut."
7716,-3,0,"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership."""
6613,-3,0,And here's some help for you to go get an education.
18928,-3,0,It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.
11333,-3,0,And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?
19277,-3,0,It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.
15905,-3,0,"But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it."
25207,-3,0,"And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be."
13504,-3,0,"We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own."
24854,-3,0,What we need to do is empower people.
522,-3,0,Welfare reform is one way to do it.
22638,-3,0,"Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind."
14062,-3,0,This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.
2495,-3,0,There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.
24111,-3,0,I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down.
4268,-3,0,"That's just not true, John."
22263,-3,0,Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.
1562,-3,0,I don't believe the present administration has done that.
24107,-3,0,"But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good."
16763,-3,0,Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.
19270,-3,0,This is not a Wall Street tax cut.
12518,-3,0,Who threatens freedom in the world?
18139,-3,0,This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there.
17715,-3,0,"Well, it isn't going to go back up."
19407,-3,0,Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.
5999,-3,0,In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.
26369,-3,0,He said it was a mistake.
11726,-3,0,"And when it gets overextended, morale drops."
5503,-3,0,"Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?"
17118,-3,0,And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.
6980,-3,0,"Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster."
8750,-3,0,"So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy."
6402,-3,0,And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.
13413,-3,0,"But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace."
16772,-3,0,Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.
6348,-3,0,But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.
33167,-3,0,"But these were statements that should never, ever have been made."
142,-3,0,"And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes."
11418,-3,0,And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.
18071,-3,0,The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.
1554,-3,0,I love America just as all of you love America.
21491,-3,0,Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.
16952,-3,0,As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.
12740,-3,0,"We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America."
21683,-3,0,"And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now."
11140,-3,0,It'd be fine with me.
26761,-3,0,"Well, I hope I made my answer clear."
14532,-3,0,"Well, how about this for a government reform policy?"
7914,-3,0,I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.
13935,-3,0,"Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this."
9070,-3,0,"I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me."
20550,-3,0,"And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history."
11858,-3,0,So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.
10057,-3,0,"Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya."
23032,-3,0,I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.
3360,-3,0,"Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?"
11327,-3,0,But here's what I do know.
2434,-3,0,"I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis."
9605,-3,0,It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.
19418,-3,0,I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.
23778,-3,0,"Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy."
24106,-3,0,"I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security."
11079,-3,0,"The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said."
26604,-3,0,It's something you might consider.
2842,-3,0,"I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned."
9242,-3,0,So here's what I've done since I've been president.
31977,-3,0,That was locker room talk.
15125,-3,0,"I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind."
29584,-3,0,"It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that."
334,-3,0,I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.
13313,-3,0,We must not be divided on this issue.
13385,-3,0,Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.
22254,-3,0,There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.
33842,-3,0,"Now, what was his response?"
10018,-3,0,"And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives."
15714,-3,0,My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.
5793,-3,0,And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.
17011,-3,0,I owe the special interests nothing.
23928,-3,0,"Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years?"
29644,-3,0,I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.
2885,-3,0,"Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected."
4045,-3,0,"By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee."
11446,-3,0,So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.
19992,-3,0,"As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues."
26116,-3,0,And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.
10124,-3,0,"So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement."
15939,-3,0,I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.
11513,-3,0,This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.
15246,-3,0,And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.
16245,-3,0,"So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out."
27975,-3,0,And there are two very different paths the country can take.
4001,-3,0,That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.
8019,-3,0,We should come to its defense.
19143,-3,0,I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.
28300,-3,0,And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts.
1879,-3,0,"He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax."
882,-3,0,And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.
33467,-3,0,"If we got along well, that would be good."
11001,-3,0,All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.
7810,-3,0,This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.
22644,-3,0,He's trying to attack me.
4110,-3,0,"And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy."
16400,-3,0,And perhaps the biggest is world peace.
8681,-3,0,"I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production."
12697,-3,0,We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.
28716,-3,0,"You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there."
653,-3,0,"Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them."
32340,-3,0,How do you do that?
6405,-3,0,"It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility."
21588,-3,0,I'll be glad to take a shot at it.
10095,-3,0,"And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --"
19417,-3,0,And I hope we can do better.
7193,-3,0,But let me go a step further.
21342,-3,0,Let me just mention three things very quickly.
17895,-3,0,Are we better of with this arms race?
17286,-3,0,All history tells us that that's a mistake.
1117,-3,0,I certainly hope it won't.
17477,-3,0,"I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people."
32298,-3,0,And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.
27524,-3,0,"Bob, let me just respond."
14692,-3,0,"We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people."
19089,-3,0,"And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts."
2442,-3,0,Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.
19705,-3,0,Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.
9937,-3,0,I was not the standard bearer.
11330,-3,0,"I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table."
28119,-3,0,I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.
24166,-3,0,No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.
29375,-3,0,It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.
9040,-3,0,And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.
8601,-3,0,I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.
24812,-3,0,They fought and won World War II.
14508,-3,0,"Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up."
20115,-3,0,"Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did."
27526,-3,0,This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.
8581,-3,0,I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.
28492,-3,0,And that means keeping our military strong.
14863,-3,0,"But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way."
17482,-3,0,The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.
25058,-3,0,I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.
21036,-3,0,"We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder."
4017,-3,0,"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""
18455,-3,0,My opponent just said something amazing.
34173,-3,0,Mosul is on the border of Syria.
12022,-3,0,"The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D."
18954,-3,0,"No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly."
1302,-3,0,"And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future."
20936,-3,0,"Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed."
26799,-3,0,It's about selecting a president of the United States.
21460,-3,0,"Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy."
29263,-3,0,"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place."
16666,-3,0,I don't know where that money would come from.
17139,-3,0,"These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way."
7466,-3,0,"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."
28294,-3,0,I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.
24327,-3,0,"National security, economic strength, democracy."
22007,-3,0,"But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good."
32632,-3,0,I've stood up to Russia.
13343,-3,0,One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.
2478,-3,0,"Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe."
5987,-3,0,"Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do."
19664,-3,0,It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.
21495,-3,0,Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.
6053,-3,0,"And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt."
27481,-3,0,"And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program."
5839,-3,0,"And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either."
8191,-3,0,"Well, we have a comparison that we can make."
14492,-3,0,"All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors."
8242,-3,0,"I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress."
26607,-3,0,And we didn't touch it.
27362,-3,0,"But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities."
28747,-3,0,"Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people."
1775,-3,0,I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.
23040,-3,0,And we're doing just that.
6894,-3,0,"The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple."
8131,-3,0,I think we should have an educational system second to none.
12083,-3,0,"Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun."
26254,-3,0,Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.
22625,-3,0,"We all thought there was weapons there, Robin."
32763,-3,0,I don't think that is a smart strategy.
28243,-3,0,"Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student."
18060,-3,0,And we pushed our allies aside.
21747,-3,0,"And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans."
24952,-3,0,"Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued."
24341,-3,0,We didn't listen to the nuclear freeze crowd.
34409,-3,0,I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.
27478,-3,0,But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.
15857,-3,0,Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.
22162,-3,0,"Number 2, if you don't rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won't be a superpower."
19116,-3,0,I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.
34327,-3,0,We used to be there.
6215,-3,0,And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.
4232,-3,0,But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.
19304,-3,0,The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.
17779,-3,0,And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.
24810,-3,0,And then I think of the older people who are retired.
18499,-3,0,Her husband PJ got killed.
22253,-3,0,"Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day."
17809,-3,0,"[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time."
17884,-3,0,"He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it."
20983,-3,0,And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.
29164,-3,0,"Well, I think that trade is an important issue."
8730,-3,0,All of these things can be done.
5889,-3,0,"Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House."
32275,-3,0,She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.
13225,-3,0,They may - are not my style.
15901,-3,0,"But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption."
26460,-3,0,"No attack ever created a job or educated a child, or helped a family make ends meet."
26661,-3,0,I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.
12513,-3,0,I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.
1064,-3,0,"I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons."
2897,-3,0,"I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future."
20665,-3,0,"But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved."
24183,-3,0,It's like having a blueprint for a house you never built.
18007,-3,0,People out there listening know what I believe.
32638,-3,0,So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.

21500,-3,0,We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.
17702,-3,0,I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.
2246,-3,0,That's -- that's a big topic.
9950,-3,0,"Mr. President, I'm still speaking."
16118,-3,0,"Now, we're not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association."
8003,-3,0,So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.

11150,-3,0,"Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said."
61,-3,0,But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.
13497,-3,0,"We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade."

13085,-3,0,We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.

13346,-3,0,The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.
29822,-3,0,But I think it was a terrible thing to say.
23125,-3,0,"Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year."
17522,-3,0,"That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life."

15454,-3,0,This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.
7935,-3,0,I'm talking about a national mood.

34102,-3,0,I've got no illusions about that.
34278,-3,0,This would take a lot of negotiation.

13848,-3,0,I could have rationalized it.
13328,-3,0,"I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want."

27254,-3,0,"We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America."
21383,-3,0,"And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch."
17891,-3,0,Isn't the real question is will we be better off?
2944,-3,0,And let me cite several examples.
11682,-3,0,All these other countries are looking to us.
10678,-3,0,"We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize."
21913,-3,0,It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.
148,-3,0,I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.
26917,-3,0,And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.
11355,-3,0,My mother basically raised our family.
24509,-3,0,"And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it."

5614,-3,0,So let me get to that.
21976,-3,0,What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.
12585,-3,0,Is our relative strength growing?
7601,-3,0,In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.
23471,-3,0,"I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio."
1110,-3,0,"One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China."

158,-3,0,Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.
28837,-3,0,"Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting."

15143,-3,0,"I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy."
21902,-3,0,That's what the election was about.
24732,-3,0,I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care.
4124,-3,0,We can't deal with them.
21767,-3,0,Send us some people that will pass the idea.
28101,-3,0,"Well, it's in this committee or it's got this sponsor."
297,-3,0,And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.

27681,-3,0,It's important for the success of Afghanistan.
13006,-3,0,It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.
19110,-3,0,And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.
14846,-3,0,"We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others."
1072,-3,0,"But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation."
29630,-3,0,And the other thing I think is important...
13282,-3,0,I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.
8201,-3,0,Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.
51,-3,0,And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.
10917,-3,0,"And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave."
29488,-3,0,"Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top."
14657,-3,0,Also I got a philosophical difference.
1982,-3,0,"Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast."
6390,-3,0,I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.
3945,-3,0,"So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though."

11835,-3,0,"And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations."
684,-3,0,"And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home."

13452,-3,0,"I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward."
4338,-3,0,We can't simply be focused on Iraq.
845,-3,0,"So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name."

12885,-3,0,We can make it move.
12895,-3,0,"If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States."

24912,-3,0,And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.

18770,-3,0,"And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium."
3479,-3,0,And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.
27106,-3,0,Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.
10682,-3,0,So we've got to deal with that right away.
13807,-3,0,You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.
16956,-3,0,It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.

12589,-3,0,"And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States."
24313,-3,0,"In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change."
6759,-3,0,"But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace."
8603,-3,0,"Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged."
27209,-3,0,"And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term."
8753,-3,0,I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.
34142,-3,0,"They say, what do we need this for?"

18955,-3,0,"I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that."
14160,-3,0,I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.
17619,-3,0,You can't wish it away.
25704,-3,0,"I was going to applaud, too."
2682,-3,0,"We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case."

16709,-3,0,We're gonna run out of oil.
15392,-3,0,"I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women."
7492,-3,0,And I think we're both very lucky.
22200,-3,0,"And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete."
22419,-3,0,I do not want to raise taxes.
24046,-3,0,"They don't want us to control it, very candidly."
12710,-3,0,"We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America."
24731,-3,0,Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race.
6782,-3,0,I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.
20846,-3,0,"Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael."
32494,-3,0,"And that's, like, no growth."
10628,-3,0,The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.
21820,-3,0,The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.
19092,-3,0,"I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play."
27020,-3,0,...that's a -- I indicated...
22730,-3,0,I meet with them all the time.
20848,-3,0,"Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade."
16654,-3,0,And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.
19828,-3,0,I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.
22764,-3,0,And I recognize I've made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country.
20600,-3,0,Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.
25966,-3,0,It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.
14390,-3,0,"I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past."
23872,-3,0,I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.
24507,-3,0,So we're still in the fight.
17761,-3,0,"Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping."
21899,-3,0,And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.
16353,-3,0,"But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to."
6205,-3,0,We tried to overturn it in the Senate.
30090,-3,0,"I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey."
3027,-3,0,He indicates he would not make those.
701,-3,0,We know where you're cutting right now.
19860,-3,0,I have been a strong force for reform.
5490,-3,0,"It's good to see you again, Senator Obama."
4408,-3,0,"I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same."
25087,-3,0,And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.
33162,-3,0,The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.
21407,-3,0,"Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault."
10377,-3,0,There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.
27506,-3,0,I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.
23458,-3,0,And you know why he gets that count?
6224,-3,0,"And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate."
2075,-3,0,"And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff."
14500,-3,0,But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.
24179,-3,0,"Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I'll get with congressional--we won't even wait till inauguration, and I'll ask the president to help me and I'll ask his staff to help me."
17521,-3,0,I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.
9231,-3,0,That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...
12932,-3,0,Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.

19244,-3,0,"In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it."
33233,-3,0,So I'm very honored by all of that.
7082,-3,0,I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.
4217,-3,0,It had everything to do with energy.
914,-3,0,"I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers."
11836,-3,0,And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.
27680,-3,0,It's important for the nuclear weapons.
14645,-3,0,We can't do that to the American people.
24283,-3,0,"One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here."
28600,-3,0,"And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you."
23886,-3,0,"Well, they've got a point."
12155,-3,0,There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.
12544,-3,0,"And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender."
18894,-3,0,I did a lot of work on this.
3052,-3,0,"I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like."
11896,-3,0,The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.
34033,-3,0,I think they're going to see through it.
15059,-3,0,"There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends."
6612,-3,0,"I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century."
25438,-3,0,"If they're space weapons, I assume they'll be in space."
10939,-3,0,"Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs."
7158,-3,0,"Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it."
669,-3,0,"And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn."
9026,-3,0,I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.
27960,-3,0,"but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom."
12304,-3,0,Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.
14651,-3,0,And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.
3321,-3,0,It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.
2513,-3,0,I -- I have to respond to that.
1305,-3,0,And that's been lacking in the last eight years.
959,-3,0,This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.
23485,-3,0,So I really don't think so.
13406,-3,0,"And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth."
8844,-3,0,I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.

31984,-3,0,His was what he's done to women.
33754,-3,0,"Well, let me just say -- let me just say."

12807,-3,0,If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.
23670,-3,0,Put a head fake on us.

472,-3,0,"I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out."
435,-3,0,"And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision."
4317,-3,0,We have to work more closely with our allies.
20471,-3,0,I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.
2502,-3,0,"That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details."
7974,-3,0,"I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong."
15709,-3,0,"So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste."
1587,-3,0,Our people wanna go back to work.
6401,-3,0,These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.
12477,-3,0,I want to do something about Social Security.

1943,-3,0,What things would I cut from spending?
15648,-3,0,"It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country."
18754,-3,0,And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.
4029,-3,0,"Jim, let me just make a point."
13247,-3,0,"Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made."
3478,-3,0,We haven't seen the language yet.
29376,-3,0,"But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence."
2911,-3,0,The American people don't know what those commitments are.

32728,-3,0,"Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?"
20546,-3,0,"They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas."
25623,-3,0,The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.
27237,-3,0,That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.
3872,-3,0,I was honored to be there.

8057,-3,0,"The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed."
28451,-3,0,That's what a leader does.
20055,-3,0,But I respect the presidency.
28253,-3,0,I think that's a mistake.

32665,-3,0,She doesn't even know who the rebels are.
15323,-3,0,These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.
18269,-3,0,"Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions."
3434,-3,0,"Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money."
25450,-3,0,That's what a President's for.
16526,-3,0,"Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy."
18010,-3,0,And that's what they are.
15364,-3,0,I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.

20540,-3,0,That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.
28459,-3,0,"I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world."

32633,-3,0,"I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president."
15689,-3,0,That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.
26525,-3,0,That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.
11160,-3,0,So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.
7321,-3,0,They don't reach those goals.
10548,-3,0,"Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly."
2117,-3,0,"And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them."
15703,-3,0,"They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?"
1241,-3,0,"It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next."
1059,-3,0,"But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character."
1970,-3,0,"And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow."
17407,-3,0,And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.
13255,-3,0,"I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here."
13125,-3,0,"Now, that is the issue."
5674,-3,0,"And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all."
8661,-3,0,"Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I."
17807,-3,0,"Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate."
24116,-3,0,"And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done."
18552,-3,0,Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.
14398,-3,0,Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.

11941,-3,0,But I think marriage is a sacred institution.
12777,-3,0,I said we had too many slums.
18523,-3,0,That's the most noble thing that anybody can do.
19347,-3,0,I think it's very difficult.
15904,-3,0,"And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue."
9047,-3,0,"And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part."
22020,-3,0,That's what the election's about.
335,-3,0,"I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help."
29876,-3,0,And you know what else I prepared for?
32460,-3,0,"One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code."
766,-3,0,That is a very serious charge against the president.
24553,-3,0,We are all in this together.
8422,-3,0,Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?
28910,-3,0,Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.
2689,-3,0,But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.
20567,-3,0,I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.
26170,-3,0,The president has been AWOL for four years.
11550,-3,0,"Yes, I think it is."
24844,-3,0,We had to stand up against a tyrant.
13461,-3,0,"And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them."
21850,-3,0,That means keep government out of it.
15936,-3,0,And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.
17912,-3,0,I believe in opening doors.
30199,-3,0,She does not have a...
34362,-3,0,It may be because of our experiences.
21545,-3,0,"So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is."

7067,-3,0,And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.
11278,-3,0,And thank you for your service to the country.

1126,-3,0,"There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea."
25092,-3,0,And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.
15889,-3,0,Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn't get too personal or maudlin.
7667,-3,0,"And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity."
3555,-3,0,"I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk."
26765,-3,0,And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.
12766,-3,0,"America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down."
3229,-3,0,I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.
15718,-3,0,"They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze."
23592,-3,0,"I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge."
19119,-3,0,And sometimes you can't go it alone.
6049,-3,0,"Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again."
14887,-3,0,Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.
15321,-3,0,I'd like to change that.
24848,-3,0,Nobody would have dreamed it possible.
2067,-3,0,"And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college."
28744,-3,0,"I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president."
12732,-3,0,We will select the best man we can get.
26373,-3,0,He still believes it's a mistake.
34133,-3,0,But she wanted to look good for the election.
10615,-3,0,We are mortgaging our children's future.
9603,-3,0,"And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family."
12748,-3,0,"Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated."
7852,-3,0,The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.
11329,-3,0,I came from very modest means.
29117,-3,0,How are we going to do it?
10782,-3,0,"The tax issue, because I think it's very important."
635,-3,0,"But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country."
15991,-3,0,The Federal Government continues to spend too much.
10145,-3,0,But let me mention another thing.
13333,-3,0,"And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better."
17225,-3,0,"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''"
7456,-3,0,I am -- you know it's really interesting.
25249,-3,0,But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.
20573,-3,0,"He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do."
20489,-3,0,Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.
1018,-3,0,But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.
21126,-3,0,"And you know what, the issue is changing."
6880,-3,0,"Once again, the president is misleading America."
7911,-3,0,"Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped."
118,-3,0,The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.
11195,-3,0,And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.
13595,-3,0,"But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way."
26285,-3,0,"Now, this economic package, Tim, I'm glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or -- you know, estate tax relief which you're not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction."
24077,-3,0,Why do we have to do it?
26360,-3,0,Sure we want family leave.
12364,-3,0,We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.
15183,-3,0,That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.
14185,-3,0,"I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling ""read my lips"", and I did it because I thought it was right."
16312,-3,0,Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?
29925,-3,0,He should have produced it a long time before.
16492,-3,0,So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.
15516,-3,0,He had two terms in the Congress.
8585,-3,0,There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.
17690,-3,0,One final point if I might.
3470,-3,0,"And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil."
23383,-3,0,"It's one of these deals where, in order to be popular in the halls of Europe, you sign a treaty."
1516,-3,0,At the present time we're at peace.
18838,-3,0,Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.
14850,-3,0,"There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests."
14275,-3,0,Sometimes he has to act.
24131,-3,0,"I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing."
15558,-3,0,And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.
17787,-3,0,I told you never would I do such a thing.
33647,-3,0,And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.
8711,-3,0,"And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he."
16317,-3,0,"I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced."
25008,-3,0,"Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight."
23463,-3,0,I own a timber company?
16849,-3,0,I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.
15253,-3,0,We cannot cast aside these regulations.
3500,-3,0,"President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters."
5659,-3,0,Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.
22111,-3,0,"I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others."
17091,-3,0,"So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy."
27485,-3,0,And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.
1549,-3,0,I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised.
23743,-3,0,"Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much."
22431,-3,0,"Thank you very, very much."
4105,-3,0,"Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions."
25786,-3,0,We don't talk about it.
26367,-3,0,Senator Dole led the opposition to it.
19747,-3,0,We've lost credibility around the world.
25916,-3,0,"I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter."
33594,-3,0,And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.
22635,-3,0,"I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time."
25309,-3,0,"I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation."
19785,-3,0,I am very oriented toward the future.
16591,-3,0,We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.
11152,-3,0,Senator McCain continues to repeat this.
19199,-3,0,That's what America is all about.
2501,-3,0,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan."
7849,-3,0,"Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960."
15856,-3,0,I salute those who participate in the political process.
7888,-3,0,I'm proud of the record of this Administration.
15942,-3,0,"But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts."
3155,-3,0,We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.
7719,-3,0,"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area."
17508,-3,0,"If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?"
3647,-3,0,"I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk."
23949,-3,0,And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush.
10339,-3,0,I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.
26263,-3,0,"Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act."
8173,-3,0,The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.
2011,-3,0,And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.
32398,-3,0,"It was principled, and it was strategic."
2913,-3,0,These kinds of things have hurt us very much.
16253,-3,0,"Yes, we have fundamental differences."
32403,-3,0,"And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out."
74,-3,0,"I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention."
19594,-3,0,"Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago."
33611,-3,0,Her tax plan is a disaster.
11738,-3,0,"And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended."
26082,-3,0,I met that woman again.
8182,-3,0,"Now last year, of course, was 1958."
23749,-3,0,"But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances."
16279,-3,0,"We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us."
12703,-3,0,"Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral."
6097,-3,0,"And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there."
32036,-3,0,"And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
8076,-3,0,This is what I deeply believe.
8038,-3,0,"Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant."
7585,-3,0,"I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration."
1754,-3,0,"I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy."
20526,-3,0,"Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it."
17804,-3,0,And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.
19889,-3,0,"If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education."
19626,-3,0,We have not been firm and strong.
3908,-3,0,There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.
21844,-3,0,And my program is this.
25719,-3,0,"We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care."
29474,-3,0,And when you look at what you are proposing...
15986,-3,0,And we are doing a better job of it.
9257,-3,0,"But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower."
367,-3,0,"And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do."
25800,-3,0,"First of all, let me say what we have done."
29193,-3,0,So we have to do that.
10632,-3,0,That's really part of your mistrust here.
27753,-3,0,How strong are we going to be?
10940,-3,0,"And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem."
12113,-3,0,"If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power."
810,-3,0,"25th of December, Mr. Vice President."
18294,-3,0,And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.
8192,-3,0,We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.
19456,-3,0,You don't buy any gun.
11685,-3,0,"This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II."
23889,-3,0,I don't have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else.
10685,-3,0,And we can do it.
21456,-3,0,I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.
21632,-3,0,But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.
19935,-3,0,I remember talking by the telephone.
29389,-3,0,"So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker."
16944,-3,0,I would have uh - done it opposite.
12179,-3,0,But it's not a statement about his heart.
10464,-3,0,It's our job to fix the problem.
21731,-3,0,I didn't get to make a comment on this.
21218,-3,0,I don't want the government financing congressional elections.
34365,-3,0,I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.
21011,-3,0,And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.
15030,-3,0,"We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go."
7663,-3,0,"Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?"
12613,-3,0,But are we doing enough in these areas?
20209,-3,0,"If I'm entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make."
3486,-3,0,"But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?"
21832,-3,0,I don't want to stampede.
14626,-3,0,"So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough."
23335,-3,0,It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.
18402,-3,0,And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.
13732,-3,0,"I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor."
12728,-3,0,"The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs."
14236,-3,0,I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.
12865,-3,0,I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.
20711,-3,0,"And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?"
16555,-3,0,We gave them ample time.
1082,-3,0,"Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise."
19060,-3,0,I ask for your vote.
1317,-3,0,I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.
28244,-3,0,Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools.
3695,-3,0,And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.
20043,-3,0,"You know, so one of your liberal friends."
29462,-3,0,We've looked at your tax proposals.
13296,-3,0,I would disagree with it.
12977,-3,0,"I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom."
13005,-3,0,It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.
27568,-3,0,This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of --
19186,-3,0,"Well, I guess some may be better off."
33952,-3,0,"I mean, who does that?"
20741,-3,0,I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.
18344,-3,0,I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently.
25967,-3,0,Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.
20387,-3,0,I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system.
18181,-3,0,Does that make you feel safer in America?
13759,-3,0,"Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot."
1350,-3,0,"And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime."
6785,-3,0,I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.
24223,-3,0,The plans are all over Washington.
19985,-3,0,I think the government can do better.
21737,-3,0,"On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented."
7735,-3,0,"Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out."
12173,-3,0,So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.
9677,-3,0,And I appreciate that question.
28121,-3,0,One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.
15342,-3,0,"The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation."
8246,-3,0,I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.
29102,-3,0,The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
2054,-3,0,"Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy."
16061,-3,0,"I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders."
13682,-3,0,But I think that's the American way.
20067,-3,0,And I'll keep my word on the economic package.
19443,-3,0,I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.
24051,-3,0,"I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe."
16277,-3,0,The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us.
29746,-3,0,"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them."
28265,-3,0,But here's what I said.
20215,-3,0,"If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people."
4138,-3,0,I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.
28619,-3,0,We shouldn't be using food.
29,-3,0,Everybody ought to be in this thing.
15583,-3,0,will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.
24702,-3,0,"All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine."
28382,-3,0,Can we take the time --
26144,-3,0,We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.
1460,-3,0,Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.
26051,-3,0,What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.
4384,-3,0,"So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war."
8152,-3,0,"I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action."
25947,-3,0,Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.
8223,-3,0,"We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people."
8159,-3,0,And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.
28143,-3,0,"I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here's how it works."
15893,-3,0,"He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live."
14089,-3,0,And we're in real trouble on that.
24184,-3,0,You don't have anywhere to sleep.
33308,-3,0,We have no country if we have no border.
24792,-3,0,We just have a bad system.
26819,-3,0,I will just say my time is running out here.
21937,-3,0,Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?
15597,-3,0,"We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation."
3802,-3,0,"And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded."
790,-3,0,Now we have a chance.
9072,-3,0,I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.
441,-3,0,And I favor the death penalty.
25050,-3,0,I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.
3873,-3,0,I was honored to speak to those troops.
29718,-3,0,"And I'm saying, where is this?"
7251,-3,0,"I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia."
19883,-3,0,"Now that's not reform, Mr. President."
17283,-3,0,"I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead."
4148,-3,0,It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.
24380,-3,0,"But you isolate China and turn them inward, and then we've made a tremendous mistake."
9041,-3,0,"Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan."
2546,-3,0,The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.
27803,-3,0,We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.
19257,-3,0,"Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission."
12627,-3,0,Is our strength and prestige rising?
11772,-3,0,"It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it."
3617,-3,0,"I can tell you, it's rife."
29434,-3,0,"And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy."
11326,-3,0,It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.
34016,-3,0,"And, frankly, you should have changed the laws."
15973,-3,0,"Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it's going to take an army of IRS collectors again."
8064,-3,0,"I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, ""Vote for me because I'm a Democrat."""
10602,-3,0,But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.
24300,-3,0,And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road.
5496,-3,0,"But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes."
8705,-3,0,"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline."
18035,-3,0,"But we also have to be smart, Jim."
18565,-3,0,"Now, the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly."
25791,-3,0,"And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on."
20081,-3,0,"The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future."
17351,-3,0,And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.
29598,-3,0,"The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money."
21644,-3,0,First you've got to have money to pay for these things.
33147,-3,0,What kind of rights will Americans have?
19687,-3,0,"I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that."
22848,-3,0,I've proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years.
20730,-3,0,The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.
17909,-3,0,"These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price."
24450,-3,0,"I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents."
10455,-3,0,"And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families."
2476,-3,0,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything."
10795,-3,0,"I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent."
22440,-3,0,Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.
12562,-3,0,And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.
16252,-3,0,"Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues."
28646,-3,0,I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.
13819,-3,0,You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.
19837,-3,0,The ones that are out there are doing well.
21128,-3,0,"Could I respond to that, Jim?"
8080,-3,0,"Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man."
9045,-3,0,"We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches."
16299,-3,0,"Yes, if we don't do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons."
22905,-3,0,But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.
6976,-3,0,And we're of course going to have to consider the costs.
22476,-3,0,Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.
19391,-3,0,Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.
7812,-3,0,We must stand for our ideals.
11230,-3,0,"It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge."
17025,-3,0,"Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government."
3067,-3,0,"Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations."
3319,-3,0,It's a matter of morality.
21664,-3,0,"Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries."
26841,-3,0,"If you don't agree -- leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this."
32854,-3,0,"You know, children listen to what is being said."
2062,-3,0,"Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that."
22014,-3,0,And it's a big fight.
26722,-3,0,Let me very briefly give you some examples.
1022,-3,0,"Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable."
9316,-3,0,"That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years."
24231,-3,0,"Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works."
22821,-3,0,A president's job is to win the peace.
18276,-3,0,I think it's worthy for a follow-up.
23078,-3,0,"If they're safe, they're coming."
1248,-3,0,And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.
7298,-3,0,I know something about prosecuting.
22617,-3,0,"That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist."
16405,-3,0,"I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth."
27218,-3,0,"I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us."
17201,-3,0,"First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in."
26355,-3,0,I see my friend Senator Mitchell.
20644,-3,0,I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.
8032,-3,0,"I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well."
7247,-3,0,And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.
19409,-3,0,"The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired."
17777,-3,0,"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?"
24365,-3,0,And over the long run they will be more reliable partners.
4332,-3,0,This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.
25270,-3,0,This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.
27463,-3,0,I would tighten those sanctions further.
12615,-3,0,"By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?"
29431,-3,0,They're going to expand their companies.
27080,-3,0,We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands.
11175,-3,0,"And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words."
15415,-3,0,"Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life."
20465,-3,0,This is a major problem facing America.
3445,-3,0,And I do have a sad note tonight.
4160,-3,0,And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.
29230,-3,0,We have to stop them from leaving.
3275,-3,0,That conference has met six times.
3816,-3,0,"Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place."
8491,-3,0,"Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election."
305,-3,0,"I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it."
26908,-3,0,"With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East."
25558,-3,0,"The formal doctrine is very arcane, but I'm going to ask you to deal with it anyway."
34281,-3,0,"So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS."
9522,-3,0,Getting us to a balanced budget.
20592,-3,0,And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.
2990,-3,0,I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.
4305,-3,0,"And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle."
29382,-3,0,"I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story."
8894,-3,0,And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.
30298,-3,0,"So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?"
30243,-3,0,"It's a good one, though."
12816,-3,0,I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.
7953,-3,0,I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.
29149,-3,0,All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.
25325,-3,0,We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.
7085,-3,0,"If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too."
31906,-3,0,And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
3995,-3,0,"We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions."
10505,-3,0,"Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support."
7524,-3,0,"It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. """
1116,-3,0,I don't believe it will happen.
14164,-3,0,I look on this as history.
19608,-3,0,"The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him."
27255,-3,0,The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.
18051,-3,0,"In fact, he first didn't even want to do that."
6137,-3,0,Senator Obama wants government to do the job.
3791,-3,0,I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.
24860,-3,0,I hope as president that I've earned your trust.
27786,-3,0,But this can't keep on going.
14736,-3,0,Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.
8606,-3,0,I think it's a very clear contrast.
813,-3,0,"He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim."
27519,-3,0,"And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible."
12834,-3,0,But let's look at the other side of the coin.
19419,-3,0,"I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change."
33417,-3,0,We will not have open borders.
10794,-3,0,"So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in."
32372,-3,0,"Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country."
11696,-3,0,We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.
11869,-3,0,"My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here."
291,-3,0,"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency."
15673,-3,0,"But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him."
23783,-3,0,There is more work to be done.
22004,-3,0,I can't give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund.
24633,-3,0,"Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are."
21741,-3,0,"Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent."
20384,-3,0,That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.
25254,-3,0,What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?
14662,-3,0,And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.
18968,-3,0,"And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams."
31911,-3,0,"I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said."
34135,-3,0,"But who's going to get Mosul, really?"
556,-3,0,Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.
15444,-3,0,"But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country."
12939,-3,0,Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.
29631,-3,0,"It would be squandered, too, believe me."
6349,-3,0,"And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system."
2555,-3,0,And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.
6315,-3,0,"And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it."
8184,-3,0,But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.
5894,-3,0,And the facts are facts and records are records.
23881,-3,0,"We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams."
20318,-3,0,We need to reform Medicare.
19835,-3,0,We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.
17620,-3,0,You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- --
22447,-3,0,But we get the job done.
1420,-3,0,Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.
9454,-3,0,No tax on your savings.
23304,-3,0,You looked at me like my clock was up.
13543,-3,0,"Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat."
18882,-3,0,And I've never wavered in my life.
7871,-3,0,"I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century."
4090,-3,0,Now here's what we need to do.
11932,-3,0,And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.
3182,-3,0,Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.
28464,-3,0,"Now, what can I bring to that challenge?"
847,-3,0,"Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process."
18257,-3,0,And they both looked at me and said: We need you.
13228,-3,0,I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.
26387,-3,0,So we talk about all these new jobs.
20071,-3,0,I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.
27173,-3,0,"Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger."
20022,-3,0,He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.
11323,-3,0,"My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do."
32562,-3,0,Why didn't she do something about it?
5553,-3,0,"What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent."
7903,-3,0,"The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period."
13927,-3,0,We cannot lose those jobs.
10098,-3,0,The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --
32377,-3,0,And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.
15763,-3,0,Can we start the clock over?
16134,-3,0,So that's not where we ought to go.
13105,-3,0,"Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack."
2619,-3,0,And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...
2818,-3,0,Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.
16385,-3,0,"Thank you, and God bless you."
21454,-3,0,"Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president."
16574,-3,0,There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.
3512,-3,0,And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.
2947,-3,0,It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.
14648,-3,0,It doesn't work that way when you're president.
15555,-3,0,And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.
6269,-3,0,"I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability."
7627,-3,0,I believe we should have a stronger military force.
2492,-3,0,"Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does."
14675,-3,0,"So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess."
10631,-3,0,And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.
15642,-3,0,"And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens."
21205,-3,0,"I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it."
16315,-3,0,"This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base."
29366,-3,0,We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.
27152,-3,0,"They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school."
8310,-3,0,In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.
12998,-3,0,America has not been standing still.
598,-3,0,And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.
21836,-3,0,"She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame."
17010,-3,0,We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.
12768,-3,0,I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.
13198,-3,0,But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.
21934,-3,0,I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.
28250,-3,0,"Now, I said there was a contrast."
7711,-3,0,I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.
26266,-3,0,You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.
14750,-3,0,"Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head."
26817,-3,0,We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.
7488,-3,0,They surely don't let me do that.
28960,-3,0,So this is a show me state.
10713,-3,0,I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.
967,-3,0,With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.
6168,-3,0,I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.
1559,-3,0,Thank you Barbara (barely audible).
31963,-3,0,She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...
8279,-3,0,"Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration."
20723,-3,0,Why haven't they done it in seven years?
11742,-3,0,I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.
1283,-3,0,"Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify."
6173,-3,0,"We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats."
25630,-3,0,"And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter."
25387,-3,0,"And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering."
9904,-3,0,And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.
3356,-3,0,This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.
2826,-3,0,"We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent."
19988,-3,0,"Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign."
3644,-3,0,"But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be."
1657,-3,0,"And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people."
11356,-3,0,I know what it's like in dark times.
2730,-3,0,"Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President."
17669,-3,0,"I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America."
32076,-3,0,She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.
22621,-3,0,"And that was the serious, serious threat."
24188,-3,0,Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.
33173,-3,0,They will be protecting the Second Amendment.
20345,-3,0,"They have an income of $25,000 a year."
17780,-3,0,"Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?"
7032,-3,0,And now the tax code is more fair.
34420,-3,0,And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.
6543,-3,0,We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.
17425,-3,0,"And so, my change had come earlier than that."
6614,-3,0,Here's some help for you to go to a community college.
17371,-3,0,I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.
18846,-3,0,"Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made."
8494,-3,0,Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.
20892,-3,0,Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.
23850,-3,0,"I believe experience counts, but it's not everything."
1015,-3,0,"overlapping, aren't those the real costs?"
12754,-3,0,Well let me make one thing clear.
22313,-3,0,Just a fact clarification real quickly.
26773,-3,0,And we're all proud of it.
2112,-3,0,"And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that."
20888,-3,0,"You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President."
18854,-3,0,I'm trying to put a leash on them.
37,-3,0,But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.
10884,-3,0,One last point I want to make on energy.
15565,-3,0,And they know who appropriates the money.
10472,-3,0,We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.
19930,-3,0,"Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it."
14845,-3,0,But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.
17390,-3,0,"I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons."
8487,-3,0,"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress."
9583,-3,0,"And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits..."
1770,-3,0,I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.
4320,-3,0,But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.
8169,-3,0,And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.
20874,-3,0,Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.
12328,-3,0,What are we going to tell our children?
1492,-3,0,"I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll."
16393,-3,0,Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.
9899,-3,0,And that's what we've done.
133,-3,0,"When you cut capital gains, you put people to work."
12559,-3,0,Again we turn to the past.
23202,-3,0,"I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment."
15404,-3,0,"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights."
32589,-3,0,"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power."
11029,-3,0,"But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world."
14810,-3,0,I do know what he has said about mine.
26538,-3,0,We need to deal with managed care.
2915,-3,0,And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.
27523,-3,0,"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action."
19736,-3,0,So it's not that we always disagree.
26787,-3,0,"We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future."
2412,-3,0,"Well, I did with my first statement."
25989,-3,0,"Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there."
9909,-3,0,He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.
33630,-3,0,But they have to pay up.
20931,-3,0,You don't test every year.
17486,-3,0,"Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion."
20326,-3,0,I believe we ought to give seniors more options.
15892,-3,0,"And I said, what can we do about it."
21426,-3,0,"If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems."
33016,-3,0,We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.
836,-3,0,I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s.
27298,-3,0,Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.
25917,-3,0,"What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution."
27573,-3,0,But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.
21178,-3,0,We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.
6189,-3,0,But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.
1346,-3,0,"of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason."
23316,-3,0,We've got all kinds of giveaways.
15194,-3,0,"This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice."
28753,-3,0,"They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people."
30112,-3,0,"And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson."
19474,-3,0,You talk about the Brady Bill.
16006,-3,0,And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.
9015,-3,0,I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.
15109,-3,0,"The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people."
26909,-3,0,"But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events."
8397,-3,0,And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.
31889,-3,0,I apologize to my family.
17094,-3,0,"Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery."
7439,-3,0,Pretty divided in the 2000 election.
15668,-3,0,"But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat."
6849,-3,0,"The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs."
20778,-3,0,There is a difference of opinion.
26161,-3,0,"And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom."
2257,-3,0,The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.
22331,-3,0,Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.
780,-3,0,You're judged by the entire record.
24030,-3,0,And I don't want to do that.
5564,-3,0,"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around."
22988,-3,0,And there's a lot of good people working hard.
18138,-3,0,And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.
28320,-3,0,What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.
3981,-3,0,And Pakistan is a very important element in this.
26040,-3,0,We need to reform it.
19045,-3,0,We will continue to stay on the offense.
13683,-3,0,"I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill."
12878,-3,0,"Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free."
18987,-3,0,We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.
12529,-3,0,"Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?"
28398,-3,0,So I want to do something about that.
10052,-3,0,I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.
20425,-3,0,The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.
13957,-3,0,I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.
7942,-3,0,"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home."
7960,-3,0,But it isn't going to be working that way.
11666,-3,0,"But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim."
7336,-3,0,"Now, let me just share something."
12992,-3,0,He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.
15176,-3,0,"First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time."
27093,-3,0,"Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something."
3800,-3,0,"I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy."
9224,-3,0,"You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money."
31900,-3,0,"But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things."
16089,-3,0,And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.
20363,-3,0,The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.
16839,-3,0,You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.
16282,-3,0,Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.
20159,-3,0,"You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people."
18260,-3,0,"You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra."
25807,-3,0,"In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things."
20801,-3,0,He decides who the right people are.
12650,-3,0,Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.
1714,-3,0,And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.
12074,-3,0,She's worked on it longer than I have.
6015,-3,0,The technology is there and we have to drill now.
16152,-3,0,And we ought to expand our markets abroad.
28270,-3,0,"But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence."
13481,-3,0,"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom."
23410,-3,0,"Secondly, we're going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America."
31922,-3,0,"And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation."
16378,-3,0,We can do better than that.
24336,-3,0,"And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war."
18546,-3,0,"Now, if you break it, you made a mistake."
23920,-3,0,So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.
8263,-3,0,I hope he would grant me the same.
19796,-3,0,"He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better."
693,-3,0,"No, there's been no change of heart."
18349,-3,0,"Well, there are summits being held."
32667,-3,0,And you know what happens?
26938,-3,0,"Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture."
21397,-3,0,"We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now."
30010,-3,0,"In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE."
6128,-3,0,That's big government at its best.
6192,-3,0,"And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president."
564,-3,0,The vice president has a long resume.
3904,-3,0,We need more troops there.
34367,-3,0,"And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy."
23905,-3,0,"And I'm sorry, but demonstrating -- it's not a question of patriotism."
14317,-3,0,"Well, I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men."
2002,-3,0,But you've been -- but you've been president four years...
6734,-3,0,And that's to be honored.
12966,-3,0,Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?
17484,-3,0,Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.
20136,-3,0,We are better off than we were four years ago.
22241,-3,0,One more time you've bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance.
24379,-3,0,"And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like."
13897,-3,0,And let me say this.
6141,-3,0,That's what I'm all about.
12797,-3,0,But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.
5527,-3,0,And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.
16594,-3,0,I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.
11495,-3,0,He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.
19193,-3,0,So some may be better off.
1188,-3,0,If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.
23527,-3,0,Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.
16068,-3,0,"Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too."
19646,-3,0,"We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations."
375,-3,0,Mr. Bush talked about values.
21331,-3,0,"I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us."
8486,-3,0,It was because they were too extreme.
20737,-3,0,I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.
11648,-3,0,We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.
23591,-3,0,"Now, here's what I believe."
844,-3,0,And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30Ãâ‚¬s and 40Ãâ‚¬s and more.
25108,-3,0,"No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things."
18159,-3,0,"Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am."
18984,-3,0,Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.
33096,-3,0,"This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election."
12811,-3,0,We ought to make one last effort.
1396,-3,0,"If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it."
7851,-3,0,One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.
23054,-3,0,"Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?"
21947,-3,0,I was in the Lomax AME Church.
7594,-3,0,"Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear."
13465,-3,0,"He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion."
14515,-3,0,"I would just point out, on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress."
1006,-3,0,"I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific."
24102,-3,0,I just disagree with Mr. Perot.
10673,-3,0,There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.
24351,-3,0,"I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square."
15662,-3,0,"And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence."
26390,-3,0,We're going to do that with an economic package.
29825,-3,0,"And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth."
7068,-3,0,It's a subject I'm very familiar with.
16441,-3,0,There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.
1710,-3,0,"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do."
11047,-3,0,"So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude."
24316,-3,0,"We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment."
33667,-3,0,We know how to get control of the debt.
7635,-3,0,The United States is a strong country.
14189,-3,0,I thought it would be better for the country than it was.
12258,-3,0,"I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met."
9628,-3,0,I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.
17529,-3,0,And I don't agree with it.
8363,-3,0,There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.
28697,-3,0,And so I don't support censorship.
25572,-3,0,"A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on."
2655,-3,0,I don't want to cut our commitment to education.
26242,-3,0,People who had the money were benefiting.
26443,-3,0,It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.
750,-3,0,"Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions."
2616,-3,0,This seems to be a trend.
9736,-3,0,"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush."
21790,-3,0,"And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant."
28616,-3,0,I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.
6897,-3,0,It's not a government plan.
31926,-3,0,And that's what I want to talk about.
12896,-3,0,"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny."
3189,-3,0,The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.
11400,-3,0,Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.
6054,-3,0,So here's what my plan does.
3543,-3,0,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington."
25821,-3,0,So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.
29006,-3,0,"You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested."
26620,-3,0,"so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it."
21792,-3,0,"If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night."
14837,-3,0,"And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process."
8143,-3,0,I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.
3594,-3,0,I want to keep taxes low.
25637,-3,0,They will know whether we used those weapons or not.
16971,-3,0,And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.
15945,-3,0,"And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided"
13031,-3,0,"In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great."
4249,-3,0,"But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue."
668,-3,0,Look at the INF treaty.
4298,-3,0,You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.
6865,-3,0,"Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance."
10020,-3,0,I know these folks and I know their families.
25190,-3,0,"Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks."
4313,-3,0,So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.
9317,-3,0,But that's not what you've done in the last four years.
13004,-3,0,It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.
20441,-3,0,And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.
671,-3,0,The Reagan-Bush administration was right.
6251,-3,0,"But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents."
2724,-3,0,"And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules."
8426,-3,0,But we also want our education to be free of federal control.
10037,-3,0,You know that I mean what I say.
12082,-3,0,"Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law."
28059,-3,0,"It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you."
27505,-3,0,"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be."
3078,-3,0,And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.
13746,-3,0,And we almost had it done.
16331,-3,0,"Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service."
12655,-3,0,He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.
17427,-3,0,I found that was rather difficult to do.
16774,-3,0,"I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity."
24791,-3,0,The people in Washington are good people.
3901,-3,0,And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.
15259,-3,0,I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.
26375,-3,0,You can decide which of us you think are right.
27468,-3,0,I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.
22303,-3,0,It ought to be tried.
8891,-3,0,"And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem."
22969,-3,0,And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.
19028,-3,0,"And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side."
29120,-3,0,We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.
27997,-3,0,I'd like to be that leader with your support.
8756,-3,0,"As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that."
18110,-3,0,Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.
360,-3,0,"And when you do that, you've have homeless families."
7897,-3,0,"And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today."
21559,-3,0,"I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness."
33217,-3,0,"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms."
25165,-3,0,"On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do."
22024,-3,0,"On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans."
25605,-3,0,"That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers."
27248,-3,0,"I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps."

28793,-3,0,"But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important."
16173,-3,0,But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.
23908,-3,0,When I make a mistake I'll admit it.
18867,-3,0,"Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't."
26287,-3,0,We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.
13308,-3,0,It must be a test of a man.
16801,-3,0,"This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration."
19252,-3,0,"And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it."
26416,-3,0,Let's look at the facts.
12657,-3,0,"What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world."
14700,-3,0,"First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible."

22054,-3,0,This is just 1 of 1000.
23166,-3,0,"I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything."

6394,-3,0,"You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes."
3370,-3,0,Why can't we have that once again?
28363,-3,0,This is a big spender.
9065,-3,0,I think we ought to get at it.
6381,-3,0,"We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures."
21029,-3,0,They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.
115,-3,0,I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.
4032,-3,0,No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.
12976,-3,0,I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.

29217,-3,0,"We cannot do it any longer, Lester."
588,-3,0,"And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days."

32414,-3,0,"Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous."
12476,-3,0,It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage.
18615,-3,0,That's why it's essential we win.
33709,-3,0,"In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?"
22247,-3,0,Those schools belong to you.
19032,-3,0,And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.
19224,-3,0,"But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president."
32774,-3,0,I would go after Baghdadi.
26182,-3,0,I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.

24480,-3,0,We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.
12283,-3,0,I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.
12753,-3,0,"Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it."
16626,-3,0,We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.
26432,-3,0,"You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you."
2576,-3,0,The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.
17590,-3,0,"Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way."
23710,-3,0,That ammo is now being used against our kids.
14051,-3,0,"And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door."
17872,-3,0,"We have -- our military, the morale is high."
643,-3,0,But I don't think we need these other systems.
6760,-3,0,You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.
1667,-3,0,"And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going."

34099,-3,0,"In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself."
31954,-3,0,"Those words, I've been hearing them for many years."
19018,-3,0,"There's no doubt, I think, about that."
1461,-3,0,One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.
7804,-3,0,"We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries."
18960,-3,0,"That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well."
5515,-3,0,Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.

22919,-3,0,"Now, I'm going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I'm going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I'm going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others."

7656,-3,0,"And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes."
10757,-3,0,That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.
2715,-3,0,And I want to thank the University of Denver.
21611,-3,0,But there's going to be a new Congress.
30406,-3,0,Where did you find this?
33638,-3,0,"We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now."
31868,-3,0,We're going the make great deals.
21665,-3,0,They're tomorrow's industries in the inner cities.
16109,-3,0,That is absolutely not true.
17255,-3,0,"As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian."

10347,-3,0,I've sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.
32872,-3,0,"Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters."
3186,-3,0,The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.
19515,-3,0,We have worked hard for peace and freedom.
5508,-3,0,And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.
19928,-3,0,The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.
2240,-3,0,And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.
27788,-3,0,"I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them."

21166,-3,0,"As I said a couple of months ago, I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am."
33100,-3,0,"And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families."
15928,-3,0,"And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college."

10993,-3,0,"Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there."
12081,-3,0,"And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands."
21774,-3,0,"I know they're popular, but I'm against them."
924,-3,0,"I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding."
6196,-3,0,I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.
15874,-3,0,We may have different approaches.
8807,-3,0,"So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them."
18709,-3,0,"And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court."
5747,-3,0,Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.
13003,-3,0,And this means more than what we've been doing.

738,-3,0,"These are American citizens, we care deeply about them."
19827,-3,0,"So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice."
1612,-3,0,"But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth."
3586,-3,0,It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.
19292,-3,0,We worked too hard to lower it.
11664,-3,0,"I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide."

21763,-3,0,We've got to do something about it.
22954,-3,0,"I've asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can't go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you."
9716,-3,0,I know how to make that happen.
6064,-3,0,We've got to put more money into preventive care.

14594,-3,0,"To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600."
24984,-3,0,"And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours."
19975,-3,0,"I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up."

15911,-3,0,"(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision."
10772,-3,0,"So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy."
14235,-3,0,"I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall."

850,-3,0,"Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal."
14596,-3,0,"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."
6910,-3,0,"If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American."
7695,-3,0,Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.
26029,-3,0,"When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use."
26587,-3,0,"If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it."
1596,-3,0,Now I don't know all the answers.
21124,-3,0,"It's a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks."
23583,-3,0,And that's the kind of judge I'm going to put on there.
16176,-3,0,I am for clean water.
10719,-3,0,"And, by the way, I want to go back a second."
33532,-3,0,And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.
1445,-3,0,It means that there will be increased hires.
7724,-3,0,Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.
26257,-3,0,But we cannot guarantee equal results in America.
187,-3,0,"So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program."
29051,-3,0,"It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America."
21550,-3,0,I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.
17359,-3,0,The American people want their children educated.
27700,-3,0,Is -- are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?
4323,-3,0,"But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well."
26230,-3,0,Let me give you another example of what I mean.
5579,-3,0,"... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000."
21551,-3,0,So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.
34339,-3,0,"But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades."
1476,-3,0,That is a very serious indictment of this administration.
5827,-3,0,We do and I hope...
700,-3,0,We know where they're cutting.
34441,-3,0,"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""
10075,-3,0,"That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief."
12916,-3,0,And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.
29401,-3,0,"I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website."
22222,-3,0,Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.
16750,-3,0,In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.
3070,-3,0,Our allies feel that we've neglected them.
2984,-3,0,"That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade."
24345,-3,0,"And we are helping democracy, Ross."
29504,-3,0,The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.
13868,-3,0,We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.
19968,-3,0,That's what our message is to the people watching.
25860,-3,0,"That's all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason."
24987,-3,0,And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.
33423,-3,0,And this used to be a bipartisan issue.
13191,-3,0,"We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again."
21215,-3,0,I want people to hear what he just said.
13842,-3,0,But let's take my life in perspective.
7169,-3,0,"And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it."
13503,-3,0,We have to be sure to maintain that.
283,-3,0,"But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member."
18834,-3,0,There's nothing wrong with that.
9064,-3,0,"We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill."
26797,-3,0,It's not about President Clinton.
16010,-3,0,We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.
21579,-3,0,I took the pledge we'd cut it out.
14369,-3,0,"I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do."
21674,-3,0,That's something I know how to do.
6013,-3,0,We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.
21615,-3,0,"And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities."
24777,-3,0,Let's get on with it.
25296,-3,0,And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.
28882,-3,0,A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace.
22733,-3,0,They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.
15764,-3,0,I held off for the applause.
8584,-3,0,"I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated."
12647,-3,0,"The Communists say, ""Come with us; look what we've done."""
27097,-3,0,We are playing the leadership role.
32276,-3,0,But the name is there.
26234,-3,0,And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.
25621,-3,0,"Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong?"
13956,-3,0,I just have an honest philosophical difference.
8353,-3,0,Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.
24957,-3,0,And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?
17716,-3,0,We're going to see that it doesn't.
10275,-3,0,"The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports."
15330,-3,0,"Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal."
6836,-3,0,That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.
6874,-3,0,I came to Washington to solve problems.
16719,-3,0,"But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained."
21227,-3,0,I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.
12868,-3,0,I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.
4387,-3,0,That sense is something that I want to restore.
22811,-3,0,"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""
30039,-3,0,"He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable."
20758,-3,0,That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.
16193,-3,0,I believe in our parks.
20954,-3,0,I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.
20728,-3,0,This is a very important moment in the history of our country.
22103,-3,0,"I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved."
27865,-3,0,The fact of the matter is...
23927,-3,0,"But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred."
18281,-3,0,"My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, ""wrong war, wrong place, wrong time""?"
25574,-3,0,But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.
10892,-3,0,I'm just trying to keep up with John.
20700,-3,0,Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.
27983,-3,0,I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.
22721,-3,0,"We're going to train troops, and we are."
11484,-3,0,"Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions."
11834,-3,0,"I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training."
30330,-3,0,"I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home."
18056,-3,0,"Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat."
28848,-3,0,"I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady."
17978,-3,0,"All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later."
16270,-3,0,"And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well."
31983,-3,0,"Mine are words, and his was action."
25028,-3,0,I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.
33785,-3,0,"You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund."
462,-3,0,"And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life."
6790,-3,0,"Faith without works is dead. """
14044,-3,0,And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.
11027,-3,0,"But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism."
14848,-3,0,"This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past."
25316,-3,0,"However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill."
14388,-3,0,"So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them."
13094,-3,0,I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.
29663,-3,0,"Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws."
3103,-3,0,Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.
17772,-3,0,"Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me."
33305,-3,0,You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.
26810,-3,0,There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.
22851,-3,0,I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.
18593,-3,0,"That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward."
17531,-3,0,The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.
27244,-3,0,"And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay."
20676,-3,0,And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.
22885,-3,0,The all- volunteer army works.
17185,-3,0,"I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead."
15417,-3,0,"I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process."
22573,-3,0,I have a plan to put people back to work.
22425,-3,0,I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.
10184,-3,0,"And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed."
33944,-3,0,I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.
26612,-3,0,It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.
33489,-3,0,And I think it's time you take a stand...
1325,-3,0,I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.
25413,-3,0,Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.
22649,-3,0,I always believed he was a threat.
30421,-3,0,I was going to say something...
23417,-3,0,I think you ought to get the break.
8029,-3,0,"And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself."
23483,-3,0,"Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny."
24089,-3,0,"If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do."
25119,-3,0,"Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission."
19245,-3,0,I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.
9174,-3,0,I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.
10997,-3,0,"In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that."
11780,-3,0,"Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus."
5718,-3,0,You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.
29732,-3,0,And we have to be very strong.
16890,-3,0,And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.
34202,-3,0,"No, you are the one that's unfit."
12084,-3,0,What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.
14765,-3,0,Who's the best person to get results and not talk?
24664,-3,0,"Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --"
32033,-3,0,"So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?"
354,-3,0,A lot of them are mentally sick.
3615,-3,0,"But, again, I want to return."
29784,-3,0,We cannot just say law and order.
8047,-3,0,"I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected."
9046,-3,0,"If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again."
24133,-3,0,And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.
29961,-3,0,I notice you bring that up a lot.
23746,-3,0,But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.
12738,-3,0,Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America.
6265,-3,0,So we've got to get our education system right.
18337,-3,0,You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.
3721,-3,0,"As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ..."
24355,-3,0,"Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened."
34065,-3,0,This is how Donald thinks.
2977,-3,0,He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.
13224,-3,0,"Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States."
6587,-3,0,I have a manufacturing jobs credit.
16713,-3,0,We need to shift from oil to coal.
30022,-3,0,"I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China."
16344,-3,0,"But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that I've got a good record."
4039,-3,0,You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.
14873,-3,0,Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.
7758,-3,0,So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.
25606,-3,0,A President must know right then.
19720,-3,0,Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.
6123,-3,0,"Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage."
22912,-3,0,You've got a back-door draft right now.
3115,-3,0,You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.
29380,-3,0,And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.
23098,-3,0,He wanted to give people rights.
9620,-3,0,"And I said, ""Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?"""
1791,-3,0,"But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim."
30062,-3,0,"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important."
3746,-3,0,The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.
2218,-3,0,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan."
18364,-3,0,And I honor their sacrifices.
15604,-3,0,"I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto."
2861,-3,0,"And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?"
24154,-3,0,"Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal."
378,-3,0,"Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?"
25866,-3,0,And what kind of small business do you have?
5494,-3,0,And they want this country to go in a new direction.
9029,-3,0,And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.
24699,-3,0,"And just remember this, folks."
29701,-3,0,"So we have to do two things, as I said."
13477,-3,0,"That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out."
1301,-3,0,"And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language."
1902,-3,0,"Well, but he gets the first word of that segment."
29814,-3,0,"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of."
26599,-3,0,"Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings."
2902,-3,0,"Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret - in secret treaties that've been uh - pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it."
494,-3,0,"The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education."
33805,-3,0,Take a look at Libya.
24900,-3,0,I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.
20001,-3,0,"But the important thing is, what are we going to do now."
19906,-3,0,We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.
442,-3,0,I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.
23536,-3,0,I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure.
25471,-3,0,"It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control."
32847,-3,0,"So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country."
956,-3,0,"Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?Ã¢â€°Â¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support."
6283,-3,0,And we find bad teachers another line of work.
23167,-3,0,What means something is: Do you have a plan?
23845,-3,0,A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals.
16913,-3,0,It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.
3008,-3,0,"These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism."
11088,-3,0,"So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way."
22212,-3,0,"Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics."
23203,-3,0,"Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added."
22208,-3,0,"I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough."
3911,-3,0,But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.
19052,-3,0,I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.
16945,-3,0,"I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison."
22863,-3,0,Let me talk about North Korea.
24302,-3,0,And we've focused on the tactical.
6590,-3,0,I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.
966,-3,0,"With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America."
975,-3,0,We live-we bring everybody along.
12324,-3,0,But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming.
2898,-3,0,"Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process."
20084,-3,0,And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.
8071,-3,0,"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""
21018,-3,0,Too many people have been left behind.
17643,-3,0,"Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up."
19783,-3,0,"That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again."
17917,-3,0,"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"
34184,-3,0,"You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy."
14276,-3,0,"And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon."
14092,-3,0,I promise it's less than 10 seconds.
951,-3,0,We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.
16728,-3,0,Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.
2337,-3,0,It wasn't thought through properly.
16625,-3,0,"But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization."
24372,-3,0,"To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong."
9048,-3,0,"Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again."
2235,-3,0,"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that."
18519,-3,0,"And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors."
6661,-3,0,"Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas."
22108,-3,0,I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.
16864,-3,0,"Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes."
27381,-3,0,I'm going to be able to balance the budget.
27241,-3,0,And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.
15424,-3,0,The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.
22276,-3,0,"You've got to have world class teachers, world class books."
3005,-3,0,"When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully."
683,-3,0,Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.
12182,-3,0,I make no allegations about that.
21373,-3,0,I think they're taxed too much.
19137,-3,0,"That, to me, is the key."
33357,-3,0,But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.
29868,-3,0,"And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place."
19416,-3,0,I think we all do.
29220,-3,0,How do you make them bring the jobs back?
7803,-3,0,We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.
32147,-3,0,"If he wants to start, he can start."
3267,-3,0,The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.
25226,-3,0,We have an arms race underway instead.
7006,-3,0,We heard the same thing.
15308,-3,0,"But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way."
32971,-3,0,I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.
10949,-3,0,"We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care."
20300,-3,0,"There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington."

21846,-3,0,"A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful."
25341,-3,0,"And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem."
30202,-3,0,"The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control."
38,-3,0,That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.
12183,-3,0,I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.
27783,-3,0,And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.
17008,-3,0,"Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth."
3244,-3,0,And the last thing I wanna make is this.
821,-3,0,Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.
18513,-3,0,"But I think it's worth it, Jim."
7923,-3,0,"On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon."
20870,-3,0,Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.
10310,-3,0,"Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back."
13767,-3,0,I've been speaking out since day 1.
14254,-3,0,But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.
14229,-3,0,You're talking about 2 different subjects.
5625,-3,0,I mentioned health care earlier.
9679,-3,0,"I don't think so, Candy."
8616,-3,0,"As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?"
12134,-3,0,"I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that."
10376,-3,0,And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.
24793,-3,0,We've got to change the system.
15715,-3,0,But we are protecting both of them.
31,-3,0,And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.
1179,-3,0,Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.
7861,-3,0,I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.
3168,-3,0,I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.
29640,-3,0,Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...
2896,-3,0,I believe I know what this country ought to be.
26370,-3,0,He said it would hurt the economy.
23121,-3,0,I have a plan to cover all children.
3625,-3,0,"I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America."
26487,-3,0,Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.
7071,-3,0,They're coming here to work.
12392,-3,0,I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.
24801,-3,0,Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?
8347,-3,0,Sometimes my advice has been taken.
26618,-3,0,"But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are."
20170,-3,0,"We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of."
24128,-3,0,"I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining."
10859,-3,0,"Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?"
13494,-3,0,Now on the question of gold.
15458,-3,0,All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.
20042,-3,0,"I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before."
9220,-3,0,And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.
8991,-3,0,"Oh, I'm it's my question."
13253,-3,0,I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.
26323,-3,0,This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.
20627,-3,0,It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.
9002,-3,0,That's what elections are all about.
922,-3,0,"I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy."
29697,-3,0,"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform."
9135,-3,0,So what we have to do is two things.
22012,-3,0,"One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation."
24814,-3,0,And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.
25192,-3,0,You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.
3503,-3,0,Somehow we've lost that accountability.
33648,-3,0,"We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal."
15248,-3,0,We have the sources here.
17678,-3,0,"Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed."
25407,-3,0,Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?
16636,-3,0,"And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter."
11729,-3,0,"It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious."
27480,-3,0,There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.
3919,-3,0,What he said was a precipitous...
26964,-3,0,"But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s."
19775,-3,0,"He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today."
25945,-3,0,So you add it up.
4072,-3,0,Senator Obama said that would be provocative.
33028,-3,0,But we need much more than wind and solar.
8381,-3,0,Not reducing the interest -
6188,-3,0,I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.
32262,-3,0,"When they see hatred going on, they have to report it."
16306,-3,0,"Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this."
27130,-3,0,And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.
26851,-3,0,Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns.
7808,-3,0,"And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance."
25218,-3,0,And we know what happened.
10775,-3,0,And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.
13681,-3,0,That's quite different than some.
33040,-3,0,They'll pay off our national debt.
9297,-3,0,"This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do."
3526,-3,0,We haven't been paying attention to them.
16090,-3,0,"And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy."
4250,-3,0,The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.
12262,-3,0,I think we need to have clean coal technologies.
16037,-3,0,One I don't have a list yet.
22181,-3,0,"And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else."
13900,-3,0,"Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer."
22244,-3,0,"Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools."
17159,-3,0,Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.
883,-3,0,"You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking."
28767,-3,0,I think it's the tone.
7143,-3,0,We also need to hold on to equal pay.
12983,-3,0,"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still."
23426,-3,0,That's how you create jobs and become competitive.
30154,-3,0,Just -- would you like to hear...
12915,-3,0,"I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want."
13729,-3,0,"No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart."
1930,-3,0,"I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue."
27411,-3,0,And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.
34143,-3,0,So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.
15757,-3,0,I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.
19978,-3,0,They're having a hard time making ends meet.
27566,-3,0,"Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature."
7177,-3,0,"And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test."
24124,-3,0,"I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes."
10072,-3,0,"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N."
12729,-3,0,Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.
11449,-3,0,"That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong."
28123,-3,0,"Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course."
17674,-3,0,"We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country."
19008,-3,0,Those words really have to mean something.
12514,-3,0,"There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live."
19629,-3,0,"In my view, the policy has failed."
17696,-3,0,I think they stand for civil rights.
9725,-3,0,And the plans that I talked about will create even more.
6167,-3,0,I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.
25986,-3,0,"I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it."
19520,-3,0,We just had the election there.
26261,-3,0,"I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent."
14819,-3,0,I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.
27601,-3,0,"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you."""
15556,-3,0,I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.
30084,-3,0,"But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester."
7796,-3,0,"I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example."
2967,-3,0,"(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope."
15520,-3,0,"We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing."
22963,-3,0,"I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence."
6309,-3,0,Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.
1057,-3,0,"But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again."
8270,-3,0,It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.
3068,-3,0,These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.
18744,-3,0,I believe we could have done better.
955,-3,0,Who has the experience that we trust?
24542,-3,0,"Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals."
13697,-3,0,He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or 2 years.
7919,-3,0,"Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin."
19756,-3,0,Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.
3724,-3,0,"Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil."
920,-3,0,I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.
1190,-3,0,Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.
18245,-3,0,"And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission."""
21871,-3,0,"And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance."
26027,-3,0,Take it out of politics.
3271,-3,0,I believe those negotiations should continue.
24901,-3,0,"Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area."
6970,-3,0,And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.
24954,-3,0,How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?
15665,-3,0,Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.
8429,-3,0,There is another point that should be made.
19359,-3,0,We have a commission on campaign finance reform.
13347,-3,0,He can set up a fact-finding committee.
9075,-3,0,Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?
27556,-3,0,And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.
19022,-3,0,But I have a difference with this president.
23235,-3,0,"I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000."
20010,-3,0,"Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families."
18362,-3,0,"Well, actually, he forgot Poland."
3044,-3,0,It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.
24651,-3,0,We need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy Ryan White to make sure we're doing everything we can on research and treatment.
19274,-3,0,This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.
12671,-3,0,I think we have to revita1ize our society.
26708,-3,0,"And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility."
11337,-3,0,"We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money."
1321,-3,0,"However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion."
24257,-3,0,"And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little."
17001,-3,0,We've got a government of stalemate.
6057,-3,0,The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.
26316,-3,0,"My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word."
129,-3,0,That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.
15684,-3,0,"The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are."
12380,-3,0,"And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider."
26514,-3,0,I hope not in both cases.
13206,-3,0,"I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island."
27166,-3,0,"We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war."
34388,-3,0,And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
14747,-3,0,"Absolutely we can win, because it's your country."
24524,-3,0,And these old boys are not going to quit easy.
16342,-3,0,"But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me."
14678,-3,0,They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.
7421,-3,0,I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.
13450,-3,0,"But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully."
10729,-3,0,"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop."""
25885,-3,0,But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.
3735,-3,0,Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.
3648,-3,0,We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.
26677,-3,0,"They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports."
9389,-3,0,I'm all for oil production.
16307,-3,0,Maybe the Vice President has an answer.
356,-3,0,"But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act."
8341,-3,0,Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.
25687,-3,0,"And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?"
7657,-3,0,Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.
19054,-3,0,We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.
11520,-3,0,"I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better."
8114,-3,0,The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.
17886,-3,0,"Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off."
29704,-3,0,We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.
25419,-3,0,It's more difficult to defend this nation.
25089,-3,0,"And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did."
10755,-3,0,"I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog."
33490,-3,0,"She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else."
9077,-3,0,I don't think you do think that.
29056,-3,0,I don't think the surplus is the government's money.
32423,-3,0,That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.
11889,-3,0,"And if they're not, there has to be a consequence."
34285,-3,0,But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.
20486,-3,0,"I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions."
12990,-3,0,Let's talk about civil rights.
18336,-3,0,What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?
8808,-3,0,"Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate."
1386,-3,0,The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.
18966,-3,0,Russia is a country in transition.
18629,-3,0,I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.
7208,-3,0,Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.
9025,-3,0,"Now, I don't think that's a bad idea."

8791,-3,0,"But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended."
20144,-3,0,"I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me."
31844,-3,0,"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."
17377,-3,0,"Well, again, I'm running on the record."
18989,-3,0,"Because China has an interest in the outcome, too."
12802,-3,0,There may be testing in outer space.
4121,-3,0,"Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned."

15494,-3,0,We've had great success in my own state.
3874,-3,0,"And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them."
19599,-3,0,We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.
21939,-3,0,I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.
19974,-3,0,"Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut."
8573,-3,0,They start from a much lower base.
15426,-3,0,"And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world."
13399,-3,0,"And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion."
25189,-3,0,"And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?"
24453,-3,0,"I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America's families, whether they're people on welfare you're trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they've got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy."
20697,-3,0,"I think that's a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge."
11357,-3,0,I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.
6341,-3,0,"And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism."

22365,-3,0,I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.
26410,-3,0,That's what we will do.

11582,-3,0,"I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President."
23546,-3,0,To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.
27180,-3,0,"We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence."
27500,-3,0,And I've been very clear to them.
21816,-3,0,I think you have to take on medical fraud.

2654,-3,0,"I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful."
17997,-3,0,Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.
353,-3,0,Because there is a major problem there.
707,-3,0,You have to make choices.
12913,-3,0,I support the President's position.
16706,-3,0,We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.
12782,-3,0,"Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy."
18881,-3,0,I've never wilted in my life.
21449,-3,0,"And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people."

180,-3,0,I want to keep this economic recovery going.
4187,-3,0,"Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region."
12853,-3,0,And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.
28502,-3,0,And I'm happy to tell you that we have.
10623,-3,0,"Well, Theresa (ph), thank you."
11075,-3,0,"If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base."
4246,-3,0,That made no sense whatsoever.
619,-3,0,wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?
14490,-3,0,But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.
13816,-3,0,Is the guy out of work better off?
7023,-3,0,I have a plan to put America back to work.
30241,-3,0,"That line's getting a little bit old, I must say."
17598,-3,0,"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me."
5487,-3,0,"Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you."
950,-3,0,And then it gets down to a question of values.
16992,-3,0,"It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate."
25585,-3,0,"I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong."
15343,-3,0,These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.
32336,-3,0,And we need to do our part.
11292,-3,0,"I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior."
11751,-3,0,"Well, I mentioned Third World debt."
17756,-3,0,"Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic."
21009,-3,0,"It's their ingenuity, I agree with that."
10614,-3,0,We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.
24291,-3,0,We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.
19942,-3,0,I don't believe in discrimination.
24194,-3,0,"And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present."
7956,-3,0,But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.
10479,-3,0,And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.
5571,-3,0,"Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around."
16628,-3,0,There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.
15456,-3,0,We talk about the unemployment lines.
21508,-3,0,I want to change the character of the presidency.

8309,-3,0,I think that this farm policy has failed.
18819,-3,0,I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.
21555,-3,0,I make those charts you see on television.
13327,-3,0,I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.
24940,-3,0,"But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed."
10240,-3,0,"And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so."
8432,-3,0,"I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should."

399,-3,0,"And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do."

1732,-3,0,My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.
7951,-3,0,"Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less."
5989,-3,0,And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.
14178,-3,0,"We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped."
11883,-3,0,"Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?"
34175,-3,0,We need to go after the leadership.
14033,-3,0,And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.
14813,-3,0,"Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us."
18961,-3,0,I've got a good relation with Vladimir.
26848,-3,0,"Because you're going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment."

2483,-3,0,"In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have."
33388,-3,0,There are some limited places where that was appropriate.
23506,-3,0,They've got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise.
5592,-3,0,We need to cut the business tax rate in America.
19617,-3,0,And the United States needs help from other countries.
6972,-3,0,And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.
24354,-3,0,That was their response to that sort of action.
20098,-3,0,"I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future."

21552,-3,0,"Now, just for the record, I don't have any spin doctors."
22248,-3,0,And we put up with that.
16350,-3,0,Let's vow to work together to do something about it.
12215,-3,0,And our state cares a lot about our children.
17962,-3,0,You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.
25559,-3,0,"Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?"

1055,-3,0,I don't know how to deal with it exactly.
10857,-3,0,The bad news is we lost.
20407,-3,0,"And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side."
28945,-3,0,I think the record shows otherwise.
24517,-3,0,"Just look at those little children, and if anybody can even think about legalizing drugs, they've lost me."
22373,-3,0,Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?
26512,-3,0,"Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again."
14324,-3,0,"And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein."
21191,-3,0,"You know, this man has no credibility on the issue."
9290,-3,0,"And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back."
28438,-3,0,I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.

3705,-3,0,It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.
15871,-3,0,They're not left or right.

14306,-3,0,"We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business."
19801,-3,0,"And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America."
10569,-3,0,But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.
21746,-3,0,"Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it."
21771,-3,0,"Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads."
13236,-3,0,One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.
20963,-3,0,"You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe."
27795,-3,0,"And, you know, that's -- you're right."
22221,-3,0,"But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools."
10661,-3,0,"We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill."

33172,-3,0,They will have a conservative bent.
28852,-3,0,"No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything."
24258,-3,0,I think the government's spending too much.
33,-3,0,And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.
8562,-3,0,"I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government."
29207,-3,0,It's very important to me.
7286,-3,0,"To me, that's the best way to secure America."
32261,-3,0,And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.
27367,-3,0,"It's not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see."
10562,-3,0,And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.
27287,-3,0,"And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness."
11345,-3,0,Senator Obama had the opening.
28088,-3,0,"Well, the difference is is that I can get it done."
24022,-3,0,We simply cannot pull back.
11235,-3,0,But we can't just provide moral support.
29145,-3,0,"As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that."

11193,-3,0,"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary."""
7426,-3,0,"I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans."
19804,-3,0,I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.

25180,-3,0,"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."
16456,-3,0,"And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary."
21791,-3,0,"Now, I have set as strong an example as I can, then at that point when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I'm going to be talking about government reform -- it's a long subject, you wouldn't let me finish tonight."
7121,-3,0,"We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today."
17714,-3,0,"I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again."
15268,-3,0,"And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were."
15596,-3,0,"Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment."

24361,-3,0,"I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future."
6326,-3,0,"Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view."
29167,-3,0,"We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions."
12549,-3,0,"They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything."
10293,-3,0,China's been cheating over the years.
27028,-3,0,...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.
25773,-3,0,We have to respect one another.
10751,-3,0,"It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side."
15449,-3,0,Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?
28555,-3,0,"If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence."
7593,-3,0,For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.
2757,-3,0,I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.
18348,-3,0,"And finally, he says we ought to have a summit."
29104,-3,0,"First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top."
15355,-3,0,"This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others."
29204,-3,0,"Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?"
12543,-3,0,It encourages them to begin a war.
26568,-3,0,"People say, ""I don't care."
19802,-3,0,"We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon."
13256,-3,0,"And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time."
13116,-3,0,"And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them."
17014,-3,0,I believe that we can work together.
24825,-3,0,"This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse."
24536,-3,0,"First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street."
6942,-3,0,But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.
10754,-3,0,"And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks."
8957,-3,0,"But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget."
8221,-3,0,"And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then."
1544,-3,0,"The American people are healed, are working together."
18851,-3,0,I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.
13001,-3,0,"We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves."
8069,-3,0,But the people are the ones that determine it.
9332,-3,0,How much did you cut them by?
24185,-3,0,"Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them."
21419,-3,0,"Now, whose fault is that?"
12921,-3,0,He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.
11397,-3,0,What's in the best interests of our people?
29687,-3,0,Race remains a significant challenge in our country.
86,-3,0,"If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country."
1886,-3,0,That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.
33464,-3,0,Now we can talk about Putin.
5907,-3,0,"Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country."
26093,-3,0,Reduce the capital gains rate.
7016,-3,0,"Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country."
12686,-3,0,"But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective."
1168,-3,0,"And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives."
34078,-3,0,... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.
22033,-3,0,Everybody knows how to fix them.
20011,-3,0,"Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it."
3462,-3,0,"And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives."
9019,-3,0,"But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong."
10437,-3,0,"Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question."
1588,-3,0,Our education system can be improved.
723,-3,0,Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.
15896,-3,0,"If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life."
30105,-3,0,"The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen."
29465,-3,0,Then you didn't read it.
17967,-3,0,But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.
32865,-3,0,I want to be the best president I can be for every American.
11078,-3,0,I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.
18623,-3,0,Never wanted to commit troops.
19877,-3,0,You attended a private school for some time in your life.
16087,-3,0,I think I've addressed it.
9560,-3,0,"I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget."
19537,-3,0,So we need more protection from America.
24589,-3,0,"I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to say to Ross Perot, please don't say to the DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs."
1600,-3,0,We might have to do it slowly.
20736,-3,0,"I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012."
16328,-3,0,"Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too."
728,-3,0,"I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can."
21798,-3,0,"They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system."
11065,-3,0,"And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible."
31896,-3,0,"Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?"
7508,-3,0,"And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher."
29510,-3,0,"And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released."
4284,-3,0,"And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona."
20211,-3,0,I will pay down the national debt.
17654,-3,0,"Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind."
20543,-3,0,I believe in strict constructionists.
7162,-3,0,You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.
16045,-3,0,There is no litmus test on any issue.
33101,-3,0,And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.
11202,-3,0,We have to double the size of the Afghan army.
24591,-3,0,I have watched these people -- the same for our local law enforcement people.
14082,-3,0,"And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests."
5713,-3,0,"So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama."
23918,-3,0,"How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say -- when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, ""Well, I'm not going to go."
7709,-3,0,"Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock."
14010,-3,0,Or do you just keep lunging in at will?
27703,-3,0,"Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden."
2114,-3,0,So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.
22771,-3,0,"You know, I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular."
25512,-3,0,"And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative."
10257,-3,0,"If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again."
17719,-3,0,"Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates."
9031,-3,0,I happen to believe it is.
3374,-3,0,"We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles."
15910,-3,0,"It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?"
28934,-3,0,I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.
29613,-3,0,Our airports are like from a third world country.
25188,-3,0,"Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime?"
8216,-3,0,"And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way."
20823,-3,0,Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.
27974,-3,0,I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.
7512,-3,0,I ask you for your trust.
14768,-3,0,"And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?"
13958,-3,0,"I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries."
26309,-3,0,He won't tell you because he can't.
19798,-3,0,I also want a bridge to the truth.
2917,-3,0,"Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state."
12869,-3,0,"Secondly, the relations between Russia and China."
17591,-3,0,"The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed."
27722,-3,0,"We have to remain vigilant, as I just said."
3686,-3,0,"We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families."
29938,-3,0,"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it."
6213,-3,0,We have to change the culture of America.
26504,-3,0,I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.
11725,-3,0,That's what it's meant to do.
21962,-3,0,I'm glad you clarified it.
13696,-3,0,I'll give you an example.
27202,-3,0,"But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong."
32611,-3,0,Because she has been a disaster as a senator.
17883,-3,0,I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.
11821,-3,0,And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.
11074,-3,0,"Well, let me just follow up, my friends."
4357,-3,0,"All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground."
11762,-3,0,So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.
28348,-3,0,We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.
29963,-3,0,Maybe I'm trying to save the money.
11116,-3,0,"Well, Katie (ph), thank you."
16912,-3,0,"Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat."
2728,-3,0,"I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term."
11224,-3,0,We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.
22238,-3,0,And the children get lost in the process.
7821,-3,0,"So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress."
11166,-3,0,... to -- to -- to...
21685,-3,0,That's the way I would do it.
26902,-3,0,And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.
27887,-3,0,"The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record."
29439,-3,0,"And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back."
29057,-3,0,I think it's the people's money.
25298,-3,0,We cannot solve this problem all on our own.
30412,-3,0,... she's going to vote this November.
17990,-3,0,Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell.
3535,-3,0,But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.
33913,-3,0,In partnership with the American Health Association...
13644,-3,0,"But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice."
8177,-3,0,"But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead."
20389,-3,0,Let me call your attention to the key word there.
15849,-3,0,"I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed."
20740,-3,0,I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.
34431,-3,0,I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.
19058,-3,0,"By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want."
33280,-3,0,"You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life."
1936,-3,0,Number two is to cut spending.
5886,-3,0,Let me tell you who I associate with.
20636,-3,0,"And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy."
25718,-3,0,To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.
24496,-3,0,But we've got to keep fighting on this war against drugs.
27630,-3,0,"And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem."
16063,-3,0,"I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench."
1407,-3,0,"I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens."
8337,-3,0,"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark."
1257,-3,0,"And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost."
24492,-3,0,I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.
34035,-3,0,But I think they're going to see through it.
14523,-3,0,We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.
15560,-3,0,And what I have proposed is something much better.
17808,-3,0,And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.
16965,-3,0,Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.
26992,-3,0,"After the election, he'll get more backbone."
7795,-3,0,"And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas."
15756,-3,0,That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.
10743,-3,0,That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.
27696,-3,0,Is the Middle East in tumult?
29317,-3,0,And I have been a secretary of state...
20405,-3,0,And here is the simple difference.
32203,-3,0,"It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced."
34064,-3,0,This is -- this is a mindset.
7256,-3,0,"My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy."
1035,-3,0,Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.
16785,-3,0,Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.
16185,-3,0,I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.
926,-3,0,"I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged."
8936,-3,0,"We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures."
656,-3,0,And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.
6844,-3,0,"We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost."
22198,-3,0,We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.
9990,-3,0,"Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise."
25588,-3,0,A President must know the essential facts essential to command.
4041,-3,0,I think that is something we have to take seriously.
11228,-3,0,"But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors."
21758,-3,0,"I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about."
20334,-3,0,If I could respond to that.
23877,-3,0,We're the United States of America.
28445,-3,0,I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.
18538,-3,0,"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion."""
18244,-3,0,We'll give you all the equipment you need.
24675,-3,0,"The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren."
32937,-3,0,That was a terrible time for our country.
21812,-3,0,"So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody."
8578,-3,0,Not at all Because these are determined men.
27201,-3,0,We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.
499,-3,0,"The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty."
26540,-3,0,"It's happening in other states that we visit, too."
10386,-3,0,And I want to fight for them.
2315,-3,0,"Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street."
948,-3,0,I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.
25534,-3,0,"I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either."
28167,-3,0,And then we'll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate.
542,-3,0,But here's the point he misses.
15749,-3,0,"And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger."
14745,-3,0,"This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road."
15428,-3,0,"In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country."
24475,-3,0,They develop a positive or negative self- image.
18305,-3,0,"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."
27806,-3,0,"We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues."
32969,-3,0,"Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider."
29750,-3,0,"You need a better community, you know, relation."
18468,-3,0,I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.
31867,-3,0,You say who's making these deals?
18627,-3,0,But a president must always be willing to use troops.
1333,-3,0,"And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly."
26520,-3,0,Raise your hand if you're in managed care plan.
9393,-3,0,I'd get rid of it.
18991,-3,0,You know my opinion on North Korea.
12871,-3,0,"No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully."
25075,-3,0,There's a big difference between the two of us.
4116,-3,0,There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.
15628,-3,0,I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.
4353,-3,0,We seem to come full circle again.
1860,-3,0,... the small businesses we're talking about...
8239,-3,0,Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.
30129,-3,0,And they're going to do that.
34147,-3,0,And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?
11038,-3,0,"We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends."
34104,-3,0,I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.
24047,-3,0,"So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base."
3113,-3,0,I was the first United States president to visit Japan.
11660,-3,0,We have to work with Nigeria.
19497,-3,0,I'm not going to worry about it anymore.
26403,-3,0,We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.
21707,-3,0,So I know it can work; I've seen it happen.
25744,-3,0,"Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question."
2176,-3,0,"But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake."
12325,-3,0,I think that we do.
18088,-3,0,He was hoping we'd turn away.
26932,-3,0,But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.
19964,-3,0,Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?
12791,-3,0,"I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again."
13194,-3,0,The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.
1167,-3,0,"I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money."
19686,-3,0,We did not feel that I could commit.
13334,-3,0,"Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management."
2024,-3,0,You raise taxes and you kill jobs.
16401,-3,0,And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.
17686,-3,0,I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.
7645,-3,0,And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.
21486,-3,0,I don't want to --
24326,-3,0,They're reliable friends in the future.
650,-3,0,"What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open."
28304,-3,0,"And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers."
7315,-3,0,And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.
13673,-3,0,The answer is to invest and grow this economy.
28299,-3,0,We've got to do something about this.
2528,-3,0,That's one way one could do it.
2580,-3,0,I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.
15645,-3,0,"I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin."
28828,-3,0,Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.
17494,-3,0,It's been a good instinct.
84,-3,0,"And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances."
29972,-3,0,"And I'm very, very proud of it."
7327,-3,0,"It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country."
10387,-3,0,That's what I've been doing for the last four years.
26576,-3,0,We can invite all the candidates.
10728,-3,0,"You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country."
9153,-3,0,"And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy."
26145,-3,0,But we have to prove we can pay for them.
27177,-3,0,We need a strong economy.
11239,-3,0,And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.
26845,-3,0,So we've talked about our responsibility tonight.
25570,-3,0,Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?
16149,-3,0,"And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting."
20273,-3,0,"I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money."
2304,-3,0,And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.
1506,-3,0,But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.
32183,-3,0,"Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money."
11423,-3,0,"And that means, for example, standing up for human rights."
18959,-3,0,That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.
26815,-3,0,Couple of service men here.
5932,-3,0,She understands that better than almost any American that I know.
8135,-3,0,"These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still."
2109,-3,0,What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.
18804,-3,0,I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.
25530,-3,0,National security and human rights must go together.
25390,-3,0,"Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?"
9768,-3,0,"And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term."
8666,-3,0,"That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation."
11233,-3,0,"Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency."
4188,-3,0,Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.
2571,-3,0,"And the key to great schools, great teachers."
182,-3,0,What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.
28181,-3,0,I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993.
21833,-3,0,Ross was very articulate across the country.
7525,-3,0,"I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America."
6788,-3,0,"My faith affects everything that I do, in truth."
19907,-3,0,"Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious."
25757,-3,0,I left public life on June the 11th of this year.
21190,-3,0,And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.
30184,-3,0,"I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing."
5628,-3,0,"If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century."
28345,-3,0,"And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years."
26916,-3,0,"Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon."
1883,-3,0,I don't want to cost jobs.
20060,-3,0,"It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear."
22099,-3,0,"Well, we have come to that position."
14135,-3,0,I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.
31908,-3,0,I have great respect for women.
32344,-3,0,And how do we expect to be able to implement those?
8110,-3,0,"In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery."
26188,-3,0,And so let me just say this.
29657,-3,0,"Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites."
2794,-3,0,"In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures."
4031,-3,0,"She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through."
12794,-3,0,So one more effort should be made.
16515,-3,0,"Well, as a matter of fact there is."
20096,-3,0,"If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?"
349,-3,0,"But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it."
34079,-3,0,"And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means."
24375,-3,0,"We still have them on, on some things."
17274,-3,0,I am a son of a Methodist minister.
273,-3,0,"We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go."
17257,-3,0,I have no hesitancy in saying so.
25603,-3,0,I remember the night before I became Vice President.
25234,-3,0,But it takes more than that.
21085,-3,0,You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.
10810,-3,0,"Hey, I'll answer the question."
14507,-3,0,"And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it."
14818,-3,0,I have seen four wars in my lifetime.
25009,-3,0,"I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us."
7394,-3,0,And people all find their ways to express it.
8846,-3,0,me that the Federal grants that come with.
25120,-3,0,"I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back."
22477,-3,0,I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly.
20212,-3,0,I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.
6562,-3,0,Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.
13384,-3,0,I don't think we should have that kind of a program.
32710,-3,0,We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.
20292,-3,0,"But I also want to say to seniors, if you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program."
22192,-3,0,So we've got to innovate through school choice.
24631,-3,0,"First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice."
10188,-3,0,And so we're matching them up.
17331,-3,0,"It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it."
25760,-3,0,They're looking to us for leadership.
662,-3,0,You see the turmoil in Poland today.
9063,-3,0,"I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again."
15084,-3,0,"That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out."
22021,-3,0,"And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned."
21186,-3,0,"And incidentally, one of them is this."
14073,-3,0,And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.
6573,-3,0,"If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how."
26065,-3,0,I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.
26244,-3,0,It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.
587,-3,0,"I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world."
17528,-3,0,But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.
29239,-3,0,"That's called business, by the way."
20917,-3,0,We're in an information age when learning is more important than ever.
9010,-3,0,I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.
12284,-3,0,We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.
29034,-3,0,I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.
17630,-3,0,I gave you back some of that time.
26201,-3,0,"As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas."
26057,-3,0,You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.
24642,-3,0,"2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country."
23097,-3,0,John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.
14595,-3,0,"And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man."
3236,-3,0,"While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement."
20315,-3,0,Trying to frighten people in the voting booth.
27602,-3,0,"And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation."
22735,-3,0,We're going to make elections.
19896,-3,0,I might say the results are highly ambiguous.
17509,-3,0,Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?
24788,-3,0,I love the people here.
24028,-3,0,And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility.
7606,-3,0,"Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom."
27870,-3,0,"And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow."
27927,-3,0,"I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin."
23441,-3,0,It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.
29951,-3,0,And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.
19162,-3,0,We'll have specific differences later.
18695,-3,0,So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world.
795,-3,0,"He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration."
13423,-3,0,He suggested that we aid distressed areas.
20469,-3,0,I found a couple of other things we agree upon.
24103,-3,0,"I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances."
21327,-3,0,"That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many."
22345,-3,0,I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.
13908,-3,0,"Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges."
27773,-3,0,"We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."
30041,-3,0,And maybe it's hardly doable.
8701,-3,0,"Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments."
1810,-3,0,What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.
11679,-3,0,"But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly."
26977,-3,0,"Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said."
14332,-3,0,That gets to the national honor.
14653,-3,0,"It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time."
13160,-3,0,"But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."
18111,-3,0,The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.
28302,-3,0,"Look, we're in an information age."
11092,-3,0,And I may have to make those tough decisions.
28809,-3,0,"So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access."
318,-3,0,And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.
18686,-3,0,And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control.
23697,-3,0,I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.
918,-3,0,I oppose supply management and production controls.
24823,-3,0,I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.
12803,-3,0,I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.
21954,-3,0,"Therefore, you don't know what's it like."
10539,-3,0,There were others who took a hike.
20424,-3,0,"Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America."
4020,-3,0,"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""
32308,-3,0,So he would have been alive today.
3706,-3,0,"The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government."
20615,-3,0,"I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there."
189,-3,0,And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.
270,-3,0,"My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left."
17811,-3,0,"But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President."
521,-3,0,"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time."
14299,-3,0,"Yeah, I plead guilty to that."
19113,-3,0,"Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words."
21336,-3,0,"And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built."
8843,-3,0,I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.
7920,-3,0,It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.
23058,-3,0,"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that."""
20499,-3,0,Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.
24544,-3,0,That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.
13127,-3,0,I support it and the Pescadores Island.
30009,-3,0,And I'm very proud of it.
7269,-3,0,"But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard."
6924,-3,0,They analyzed the senator's plan.
34415,-3,0,What we need to do is go after...
6745,-3,0,It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.
17448,-3,0,"With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution."
11053,-3,0,We are a force of good in the world.
25137,-3,0,The most recent has been the one in Brighton.
28584,-3,0,"Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster."
10382,-3,0,Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.
7714,-3,0,"I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress."
3272,-3,0,"But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them."
7187,-3,0,"Well, again, the president didn't answer the question."
13954,-3,0,"Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?"
19508,-3,0,The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.
3170,-3,0,"Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home."
14731,-3,0,The US is doing better than a lot.
3731,-3,0,Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.
32207,-3,0,"No, I mean, he clarified what he meant."
23715,-3,0,There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.
2806,-3,0,The other point I wanna make is about our defense.
24036,-3,0,"I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels we've come up with are just about right."
9773,-3,0,"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."""
5789,-3,0,"And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy."
28705,-3,0,I care a lot about this.
7681,-3,0,What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?
9494,-3,0,I think that grows the economy.
8356,-3,0,Mine has been in the executive branch.
19636,-3,0,This is a serious business.
18880,-3,0,I have no intention of wilting.
33454,-3,0,So just to finish on the borders...
19791,-3,0,And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.
29055,-3,0,"After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back."
6264,-3,0,"This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power."
4003,-3,0,"Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state."
24078,-3,0,"Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler."
13185,-3,0,"Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again."
10864,-3,0,And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.
30226,-3,0,That would not start a war.
33804,-3,0,Take a look at the migration.
3927,-3,0,And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.
5561,-3,0,The last point I'll make about small businesses.
16893,-3,0,They have too many employees.
10906,-3,0,You know who voted against it?
21120,-3,0,It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.
30280,-3,0,"At the same time, we have to be prepared."
11812,-3,0,But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.
22218,-3,0,"Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start."
15200,-3,0,"And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true."
26035,-3,0,I told them in early '95.
12250,-3,0,"Well, let me start with Texas."
16556,-3,0,I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.
15750,-3,0,So military security and economic security go hand in hand.
16725,-3,0,That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.
24419,-3,0,"But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it."
15975,-3,0,"But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration."
26566,-3,0,"I have been in politics for some time, and I worry about the people who don't vote."
10587,-3,0,They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again.
15581,-3,0,"No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending"
13293,-3,0,"I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan."
32153,-3,0,"Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act."
25539,-3,0,"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."
8860,-3,0,Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.
6498,-3,0,"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """
21853,-3,0,"I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point."
15448,-3,0,Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?
23614,-3,0,"But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever."
17031,-3,0,"In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe."
7760,-3,0,But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.
12832,-3,0,"I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points."
12742,-3,0,"Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else."
24978,-3,0,I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.
1410,-3,0,"I uh - believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh - Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh - court uh - that preceded it."
16263,-3,0,"But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success."
8158,-3,0,"If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails."
15180,-3,0,I am not talking of scrapping.
24771,-3,0,"Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington."
14616,-3,0,"Key thing here, see, we all come up with images."
19030,-3,0,"I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear."
17523,-3,0,"But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?"
26645,-3,0,Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.
10941,-3,0,"Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach."
3957,-3,0,I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.
7982,-3,0,"We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history."
7832,-3,0,I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.
33090,-3,0,"Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question."
8174,-3,0,There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.
10463,-3,0,"Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful."
10390,-3,0,"Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout."
5627,-3,0,"If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia."
13975,-3,0,I want to change it.
3091,-3,0,But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.
33687,-3,0,He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.
7483,-3,0,"And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong."
13499,-3,0,We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.
13993,-3,0,That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.
23655,-3,0,So you got to have a judicial intervention.
21895,-3,0,We have elections so people can make decisions about this.
9059,-3,0,"The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth."
20439,-3,0,I commend you for supporting that.
1144,-3,0,"He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years."
12773,-3,0,The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.
28684,-3,0,Government ought to stand on the side of parents.
33871,-3,0,"What happened to the FBI, I don't know."
9659,-3,0,That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.
5796,-3,0,And that is something that I would welcome.
2175,-3,0,"By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it."
20594,-3,0,"Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election."
22260,-3,0,I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.
33495,-3,0,... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...
1664,-3,0,The auto industry has come roaring back.
21095,-3,0,I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.
7536,-3,0,"And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty."
16272,-3,0,"But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions."
8045,-3,0,In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.
4319,-3,0,But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.
217,-3,0,Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.
7465,-3,0,"When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue."
15909,-3,0,"But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions."
272,-3,0,But I salute him for his passion.
14081,-3,0,We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.
13292,-3,0,"Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon."
30365,-3,0,"To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina."
5648,-3,0,"OK, what -- what would I cut?"
1406,-3,0,"Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious."
33860,-3,0,"And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren."
23986,-3,0,What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.
30432,-3,0,But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.
17713,-3,0,And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.
17849,-3,0,"The question, I think, should be enlarged."
17194,-3,0,"He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world."
8297,-3,0,They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.
34359,-3,0,I want to invest in your family.
33013,-3,0,"But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole."
9136,-3,0,We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.
33475,-3,0,"... from everything I see, has no respect for this person."
11026,-3,0,And that is one of the challenges that America faces.
24200,-3,0,"Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things."
613,-3,0,We're going to have to-the MX.
21213,-3,0,"And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress."
680,-3,0,"We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about."
463,-3,0,"And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother."
8611,-3,0,The means are at question.
7678,-3,0,"These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know."
24432,-3,0,It's a different world now.
25609,-3,0,America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.
895,-3,0,But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.
24564,-3,0,We have got to pull together.
7863,-3,0,Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.
23745,-3,0,I respect him for that.
768,-3,0,But the point is sometimes the action-
26072,-3,0,Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.
22936,-3,0,"You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone."
12302,-3,0,And so -- on the logging issue.
24679,-3,0,"-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done."
1165,-3,0,"At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win."
18219,-3,0,Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.
16440,-3,0,"We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work."
19781,-3,0,That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.
16496,-3,0,"On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad."
19509,-3,0,"I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security."
1518,-3,0,We are not at war.
62,-3,0,That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.
26320,-3,0,We're not going to touch Medicare.
880,-3,0,"When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision."
6222,-3,0,I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.
28722,-3,0,"I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this."
6149,-3,0,"If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it."
2332,-3,0,"Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts."
355,-3,0,And we've got to attend to them.
7697,-3,0,"And then fourthly, as a moral leader."
21314,-3,0,There will be a job-sucking sound going south.
21501,-3,0,"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote ""political chameleon"" for changing his positions of all times."
8903,-3,0,And why have they lost their industry?
24331,-3,0,"We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having."
29800,-3,0,"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other."
22428,-3,0,"If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?"
21647,-3,0,"I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it."
29653,-3,0,"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government."
14245,-3,0,"Now, I think that's going back to where we started."
26231,-3,0,"To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort."
22145,-3,0,I'll close on this point.
2962,-3,0,I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.
33756,-3,0,We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.
21195,-3,0,The time for campaign funding reform is after the election.
16297,-3,0,This is another example of misplaced priorities.
3712,-3,0,So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.
29110,-3,0,"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work."
21321,-3,0,We got to cut it out.
10170,-3,0,"That's what we need more of, Candy."
27970,-3,0,I want to see growing peace in this country.
15119,-3,0,"Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives."
721,-3,0,He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.
10497,-3,0,"I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace."
3975,-3,0,But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.
11721,-3,0,Maybe I'm missing something here.
13959,-3,0,"And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer."
23642,-3,0,These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.
24426,-3,0,We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.
6295,-3,0,And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.
20005,-3,0,Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.
27668,-3,0,Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.
4028,-3,0,And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.
8118,-3,0,"If we fail, then freedom fails."
12997,-3,0,"Now the second point we have to understand is this, however."
8527,-3,0,The major threat is external and will continue.
13480,-3,0,This one must be stepped up.
15639,-3,0,"The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink."
10462,-3,0,You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.
24532,-3,0,I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.
11398,-3,0,When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.
31982,-3,0,"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse."
12614,-3,0,What are freedom's chances in those areas?
7817,-3,0,To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.
8386,-3,0,"Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security."
6631,-3,0,I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.
23069,-3,0,You know what he did?
22809,-3,0,"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"
9147,-3,0,"And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable."
27230,-3,0,Doing everything we can to control our own energy.
29009,-3,0,Now let me come directly to your question.
4244,-3,0,Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.
28816,-3,0,"Well, you establish respect for differences."
31979,-3,0,"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country."
24237,-3,0,"But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time."
26409,-3,0,"Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America."
26628,-3,0,Now none of that will happen anymore.
13165,-3,0,It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.
30207,-3,0,"Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO."
30276,-3,0,We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.
8066,-3,0,What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.
19936,-3,0,I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.
24585,-3,0,"I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination."
6717,-3,0,That's not what we want.
15731,-3,0,"Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent."
526,-3,0,One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.
20255,-3,0,That's not what I think.
18250,-3,0,A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.
20597,-3,0,It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.
16251,-3,0,"(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds."
16376,-3,0,They say we should be satisfied.
10851,-3,0,"Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that."
12272,-3,0,"If you own the land, every day is Earth Day."
12961,-3,0,"And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language."
12572,-3,0,"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President."
15688,-3,0,And that's the kind of America I want.
20840,-3,0,"But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change."
29796,-3,0,"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way."
24293,-3,0,We've got to help them.
1042,-3,0,I think the American people are too.
21049,-3,0,I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.
19380,-3,0,That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.
197,-3,0,But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.
138,-3,0,So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.
17853,-3,0,"So far, it is only a beginning."
24458,-3,0,"The best expression of my family values is that tonight's my 17th wedding anniversary, and I'd like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here."
14510,-3,0,"I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong."
12688,-3,0,"It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that."
27917,-3,0,"I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years."
24208,-3,0,It is the number one culprit.
14592,-3,0,"Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said."
12660,-3,0,I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.
21636,-3,0,They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.
2669,-3,0,You've done a great job.
27443,-3,0,"I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."
28190,-3,0,We share a common border with another nation.
26904,-3,0,"And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again."
10971,-3,0,Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.
19468,-3,0,"In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite."
13144,-3,0,"Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris."
2021,-3,0,And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.
22138,-3,0,I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.
15801,-3,0,These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.
20293,-3,0,But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.
28713,-3,0,And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.
17265,-3,0,We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.
17854,-3,0,"If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job."
22610,-3,0,"After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently."
21610,-3,0,We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.
15589,-3,0,There is no way of anticipating what may happen.
4256,-3,0,"And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that."
19739,-3,0,"But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be."
8077,-3,0,I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.
24601,-3,0,Coming from the political process.
26389,-3,0,We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.
11401,-3,0,Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.
12169,-3,0,Let me just tell you who the jury is.
1697,-3,0,"Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America."
34168,-3,0,"Now, why does that matter?"
2340,-3,0,Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.
20678,-3,0,"They said even if we are the strongest if we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that."
1969,-3,0,And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.
9868,-3,0,I want it to be clearer.
29147,-3,0,But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.
1536,-3,0,The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.
111,-3,0,Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.
28180,-3,0,I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers.
1311,-3,0,I would not work hard to support any of those.
2853,-3,0,We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.
10953,-3,0,You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.
13624,-3,0,It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.
11629,-3,0,"Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean."
27044,-3,0,That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.
15943,-3,0,And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.
29244,-3,0,And it has not been easy.
2404,-3,0,"No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ..."
5668,-3,0,That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.
28875,-3,0,"Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines."
25369,-3,0,"And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?"
19344,-3,0,So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.
6214,-3,0,Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.
1348,-3,0,"That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity."
23823,-3,0,"This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people."
24134,-3,0,"I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery."
19741,-3,0,Maybe that was the purpose.
21476,-3,0,How would he feel about it?
22915,-3,0,It hurts the middle class.
16347,-3,0,His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.
23981,-3,0,I questioned his judgment and his character.
11042,-3,0,There are some things I don't understand.
14381,-3,0,"And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation."
5772,-3,0,"I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate."
3920,-3,0,That's what Admiral Mullen said.
28559,-3,0,"And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't."
26577,-3,0,And talk about the economy.
12891,-3,0,This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.
27059,-3,0,We have made sure that they are isolated.
23979,-3,0,"Well, let me--I have to correct one thing."
28865,-3,0,"And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that."
25629,-3,0,"And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing."
29155,-3,0,That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.
22109,-3,0,"And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things."
19647,-3,0,"I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work."
19491,-3,0,"So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong."
20771,-3,0,Let me give you one example.
14932,-3,0,"Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less."
15103,-3,0,"In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home."
915,-3,0,But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.
28808,-3,0,"I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential."
2015,-3,0,Why don't I want to raise taxes on people?
726,-3,0,He's got to get this thing more clear.
538,-3,0,This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.
15559,-3,0,"And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that."
945,-3,0,The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.
461,-3,0,"And you see, yes, my position has evolved."
33227,-3,0,"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further."
24476,-3,0,At a very early age they learn how to learn.
13936,-3,0,"I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --"
24997,-3,0,We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.
25596,-3,0,America is not temporary; we're forever.
2799,-3,0,It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.
31980,-3,0,"And certainly, I'm not proud of it."
20993,-3,0,"On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects."
27334,-3,0,"By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare."
4163,-3,0,"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"
30342,-3,0,And it's a big problem.
22136,-3,0,We have to have our people at work.
25551,-3,0,"And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done."
16906,-3,0,"He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government."
33503,-3,0,She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
16099,-3,0,We're going to tell you how to do it all.
5983,-3,0,And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.
1666,-3,0,But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.
10998,-3,0,So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.
11957,-3,0,I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.
7459,-3,0,"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."
8043,-3,0,We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.
21765,-3,0,"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits."
21003,-3,0,I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.
21264,-3,0,There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.
3571,-3,0,"And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them."
11822,-3,0,"One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces."
15925,-3,0,"But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make."
16184,-3,0,"So I'll just keep saying, I am one."
25181,-3,0,"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''"
27250,-3,0,"We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables."
2290,-3,0,Let me give you an example.
16005,-3,0,"So, I don't want to fool around with it."
8529,-3,0,I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.
23678,-3,0,"And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that."
23010,-3,0,That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.
15304,-3,0,"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy."
27809,-3,0,That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.
32889,-3,0,"You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C."
6967,-3,0,"But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy."
8589,-3,0,But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.
13312,-3,0,Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.
28356,-3,0,The Senate Budget Committee --
27088,-3,0,"But I believe -- we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a -- as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East."
21932,-3,0,I love my grandchildren --
7720,-3,0,But let's look at the performance.
7242,-3,0,"He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution."
22442,-3,0,Congress -- they're all good people.
24683,-3,0,"This is a town where the White House says, Congress did it; Congress says, the White House did it."
8970,-3,0,"Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures."
19745,-3,0,"Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America."
24855,-3,0,We need to invest and save.
32852,-3,0,This is the only one country he's ever known.
27315,-3,0,"That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President."
25720,-3,0,We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco.
19047,-3,0,We'll continue to build our alliances.
22727,-3,0,Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.
19378,-3,0,But let me respond to what you said.
25528,-3,0,We need to stand for human rights.
3972,-3,0,And it's going to be tough.
8445,-3,0,I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.
1929,-3,0,"I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue."
29114,-3,0,I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.
2073,-3,0,And so budgets reflect choices.
3589,-3,0,"I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee."
23857,-3,0,We have got to have the courage to change.
7077,-3,0,"See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it."
14667,-3,0,"I'm the last one, right?"
24159,-3,0,We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.
15791,-3,0,"I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had."
20143,-3,0,I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.
10742,-3,0,"I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America."
6667,-3,0,And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.
21886,-3,0,The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.
20108,-3,0,The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.
11359,-3,0,I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.
23594,-3,0,I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.
14769,-3,0,"Finally, to you students up there -- God bless you, I'm doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream."
25415,-3,0,I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.
12956,-3,0,We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.
31888,-3,0,I'm not proud of it.
24246,-3,0,I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.
17821,-3,0,"We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment."
3423,-3,0,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight."
2851,-3,0,But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.
10889,-3,0,We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.
21596,-3,0,We hear all the negatives.
29196,-3,0,Let me give you the example of Mexico.
14409,-3,0,Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?
28439,-3,0,I've got a strategy for the Middle East.
18131,-3,0,"Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make."
16446,-3,0,Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.
24218,-3,0,"I've already put forward things that'll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight--investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers."
19566,-3,0,That would be my position.
6799,-3,0,I think it's important to promote a culture of life.
29023,-3,0,I would like to tell you something about me.
8703,-3,0,"That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country."
2951,-3,0,"If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel."
8437,-3,0,My objection here is not the cost in dollars.
3982,-3,0,And I know how to work with them.
6586,-3,0,"I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education."
34121,-3,0,"I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?"
131,-3,0,Let me help the governor.
15747,-3,0,And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won't address is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our economic security.
11234,-3,0,And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.
19161,-3,0,That's my difference with the President.
15807,-3,0,"Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba."
15023,-3,0,We also are pursuing housing programs.
12573,-3,0,First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.
19793,-3,0,Maybe in your case maybe just two.
30040,-3,0,"The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough."
1409,-3,0,"So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past."
6299,-3,0,But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.
15890,-3,0,"Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin."
16336,-3,0,"And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish."
798,-3,0,And there is a difference principle -
22082,-3,0,"I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets."
24404,-3,0,And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.
26720,-3,0,"And yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe."
19960,-3,0,Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.
108,-3,0,"Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make."
4221,-3,0,"And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire."
8600,-3,0,I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.
12127,-3,0,So it's one of my top priorities.
2997,-3,0,"The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East."
10467,-3,0,We have to keep Americans' taxes low.
14234,-3,0,You've got to go to the people.
12877,-3,0,"But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system."
30304,-3,0,I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.
16135,-3,0,There are plenty of places to cut.
15055,-3,0,It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.
1261,-3,0,"Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there."
1574,-3,0,"And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington."
27324,-3,0,"Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through."
2394,-3,0,"Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover."
25424,-3,0,-- -- and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.
18166,-3,0,But I don't believe this president can.
22966,-3,0,"Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today."
20647,-3,0,Morale in today's military is too low.
22049,-3,0,They just write a note for the interest.
27916,-3,0,That's why we have to move forward and not go back.
26251,-3,0,I get a 10-point spot.
7947,-3,0,"And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life."
32669,-3,0,Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.
10635,-3,0,And you know what you'll find?
32682,-3,0,So she wants to fight.
13227,-3,0,"Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can."
32045,-3,0,I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.
18541,-3,0,"And so, the plan he talks about simply won't work."
7987,-3,0,"But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate."
11396,-3,0,First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?
18518,-3,0,"And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war."
6660,-3,0,"What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job."
27955,-3,0,I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.
400,-3,0,"We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue."
19831,-3,0,Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.
786,-3,0,You judge on the record.
28909,-3,0,There have been some tough cases come across my desk.
13240,-3,0,"And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States."
24250,-3,0,"I've had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets."
21936,-3,0,If the question -- maybe I -- get it wrong.
5888,-3,0,"If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO."
33943,-3,0,And you take a look at the people of Haiti.
3480,-3,0,"So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan."
20225,-3,0,We know how to set agendas.
18074,-3,0,It's the hardest decision a president makes.
6808,-3,0,"What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs."
7084,-3,0,And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.
3375,-3,0,It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.
7628,-3,0,I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.
11557,-3,0,The administration deserves credit for having made it work.
30194,-3,0,"I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?"
3624,-3,0,"I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care."
5936,-3,0,"Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too."
6787,-3,0,"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """
28825,-3,0,I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.
562,-3,0,"It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick."
28150,-3,0,"And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen."
30126,-3,0,It's a lot of money to protect other people.
18184,-3,0,I believe in protecting America first.
19501,-3,0,"You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals."
34334,-3,0,We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.
24531,-3,0,"If drugs were legal, I don't think he'd be alive today."
1725,-3,0,"How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign."
18291,-3,0,When I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong.
14302,-3,0,"I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you."
31945,-3,0,"That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity."
23855,-3,0,And we have to change in this country.
29828,-3,0,"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?"
5670,-3,0,"Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze."
421,-3,0,"No, I don't think there is."
2888,-3,0,I am a graduate of the U.S.
23524,-3,0,"And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering."
6266,-3,0,"Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both."
20517,-3,0,He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.
30344,-3,0,We cannot be the policemen of the world.
23643,-3,0,I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.
26268,-3,0,"General Colin Powell said the same thing, he fears the initiative would take away the extra effort programs."
16669,-3,0,"We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978."
20759,-3,0,Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.
17981,-3,0,September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.
3149,-3,0,"As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power."
6403,-3,0,But it's not going to be easy.
11989,-3,0,So I favor closing the gun show loophole.
17747,-3,0,"What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems."
25612,-3,0,We need to move on.
20827,-3,0,It's how we unfortunately label certain children.
13302,-3,0,Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.
15762,-3,0,I think the foremost (Applause)
3240,-3,0,Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.
18694,-3,0,"How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what we've done, in that way?"
24323,-3,0,"And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world."
24465,-3,0,"I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours."
345,-3,0,I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.
6068,-3,0,"Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans."
15561,-3,0,And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.
28635,-3,0,I'm from a big farm state.
12257,-3,0,And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.
7703,-3,0,We have to practice what we preach.
2366,-3,0,"And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive."
1328,-3,0,Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.
16074,-3,0,"Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?"
28166,-3,0,I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.
12645,-3,0,"And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better."
13443,-3,0,That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.
9216,-3,0,But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.
12078,-3,0,But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.
12610,-3,0,We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.
16509,-3,0,And this is why a tax reform is so important.
26567,-3,0,"And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault."
6731,-3,0,I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.
23860,-3,0,"I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year."
26667,-3,0,"Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here."
14410,-3,0,"The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake."
10545,-3,0,"And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country."
11920,-3,0,"And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy."
9145,-3,0,I know what it takes to get this economy going.
25179,-3,0,"Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign."
16322,-3,0,and must do what he's talking about now.
6740,-3,0,It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process.
28411,-3,0,I'm not going to ask them.
8623,-3,0,I think we're ready to move.
23665,-3,0,It's clear for everybody to see.
10579,-3,0,Americans' workers are the best in the world.
24112,-3,0,He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.
20553,-3,0,It's very clear to me.
12456,-3,0,"If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority."
3556,-3,0,I will make them famous.

23917,-3,0,"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""
27034,-3,0,"You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean."

20050,-3,0,"See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued."
4325,-3,0,"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways."
7745,-3,0,That's a test of prestige.

21148,-3,0,"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""
7823,-3,0,"Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is."
8011,-3,0,We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.
425,-3,0,I'm also very tough on violent crime.
17254,-3,0,"At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign."
1070,-3,0,We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.
24980,-3,0,I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.
28310,-3,0,"We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers."

19024,-3,0,I have a plan for Iraq.
33143,-3,0,"Thank you very much, Chris."
17505,-3,0,"And it's not that simple, either."
18962,-3,0,"And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes."
28200,-3,0,So health care needs to be affordable and available.
7107,-3,0,"We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows."
16443,-3,0,"Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing."
13750,-3,0,I want the line-item veto.
110,-3,0,"Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country."
18481,-3,0,And the president chose the wrong way.
33246,-3,0,"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen."
34330,-3,0,"We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies."

11848,-3,0,"The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?"
13668,-3,0,But look what's happened to the middle class.
29711,-3,0,"And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country."
18998,-3,0,"Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy."
28220,-3,0,"One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul."
28371,-3,0,"And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it."
15846,-3,0,It's gotten a little nasty.
12530,-3,0,I think there're several reasons.
60,-3,0,I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.
2532,-3,0,You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.
25432,-3,0,But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.
24289,-3,0,I hope we can talk more about that.
27679,-3,0,And it's important for them.
10324,-3,0,Government does not create jobs.
13153,-3,0,"Now, we may not succeed."
33381,-3,0,We either have -- and by the way...
12839,-3,0,"And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is."
24180,-3,0,And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.
10763,-3,0,"There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one."
10465,-3,0,"Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence."

9386,-3,0,"What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy."
26459,-3,0,But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.
16250,-3,0,"I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates."
16296,-3,0,"Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on."
24670,-3,0,"Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --"
22104,-3,0,"If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future."
4030,-3,0,"I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay."
22992,-3,0,It's a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other.
22219,-3,0,"And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want."
25391,-3,0,There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.
4316,-3,0,We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.
28861,-3,0,"If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that."
3567,-3,0,"Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important."
34026,-3,0,I'll look at it at the time.
24340,-3,0,And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.
17015,-3,0,"And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth."
10842,-3,0,And our best days are ahead of us.
7931,-3,0,"Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable."
14088,-3,0,What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.
17699,-3,0,I think the business community wants to get involved.
19414,-3,0,"Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you."
28342,-3,0,I'm not just saying this.
21499,-3,0,"So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this."
33191,-3,0,I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.
2517,-3,0,"When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster."
13300,-3,0,I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.
13383,-3,0,Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?
15797,-3,0,Members of the clergy who have done the same.
25510,-3,0,It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.
10618,-3,0,"So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts."
7728,-3,0,What we need is action.
22025,-3,0,You have a raging debate about those plans.
27235,-3,0,"Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it."
17908,-3,0,"And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful."
32685,-3,0,You don't even know who the rebels are.
11210,-3,0,We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.
15788,-3,0,I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive.
6084,-3,0,Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.
28915,-3,0,I'm not proud of any record.
20023,-3,0,Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.
32895,-3,0,She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.
24314,-3,0,There are three fundamental challenges.
18691,-3,0,"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos."""
28698,-3,0,But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.
1330,-3,0,"Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right."
7436,-3,0,"And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in."
1959,-3,0,"Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state."
18643,-3,0,"I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force."
24605,-3,0,I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.
33461,-3,0,"And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country."
13912,-3,0,We've got to proceed very carefully on that.
4312,-3,0,"I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike."
24454,-3,0,And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act.
23762,-3,0,"I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future."
6399,-3,0,In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.
30145,-3,0,And you're going to stop them?
13422,-3,0,The Vice President suggested a number of things.
19392,-3,0,"Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President."
13028,-3,0,"What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?"
893,-3,0,I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.
17473,-3,0,"And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own."
18870,-3,0,"It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right."
15229,-3,0,"This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect."
12699,-3,0,"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want."
11563,-3,0,IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.
8674,-3,0,"fiscal restraint, I think is necessary."
1974,-3,0,"Now, we all know that we've got to do more."
16143,-3,0,"We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture."
11181,-3,0,"And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate."
19218,-3,0,"It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off."
21876,-3,0,A senator runs every 6 years.
25602,-3,0,This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.
11204,-3,0,We have to do a lot of things.
30035,-3,0,It is -- it is a huge problem.
12266,-3,0,We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down.
18317,-3,0,And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.
27276,-3,0,We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.
1114,-3,0,"I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened."
26388,-3,0,We'd better wait and see what the results are.
14293,-3,0,You talk about somebody strong.
20884,-3,0,You can't have voluntary testing.
24309,-3,0,Because they could go back worse than things used to be.
4230,-3,0,"So, this is a very difficult situation."
17216,-3,0,Our policy was not to cut subsidies.
15451,-3,0,"Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?"
18633,-3,0,"Maybe an 18th resolution would work,"" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off."
26003,-3,0,Let's talk about them separately.
29580,-3,0,"You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail."
19569,-3,0,"I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money."
32015,-3,0,So you really owe him an apology.
17748,-3,0,"I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit."
6847,-3,0,"And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care."
21098,-3,0,"Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust."
21696,-3,0,"But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them."
8762,-3,0,"Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact."
22420,-3,0,I differ with the 2 here on that.
23037,-3,0,There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.
19971,-3,0,"And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme."
5830,-3,0,"But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues."
18445,-3,0,I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.
28044,-3,0,"Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand."
27495,-3,0,"But over time, what they can do is regain credibility."
24906,-3,0,"A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power."
26212,-3,0,"I keep my word, and you will have a tax cut."
11342,-3,0,"But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction."
21254,-3,0,And we have a very important decision to make.
11820,-3,0,"That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about."
1918,-3,0,Look at the evidence of the last four years.
32736,-3,0,And I'm pretty good at it.
23611,-3,0,I was an altar boy.
18002,-3,0,"I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead."
17261,-3,0,"I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington."
17961,-3,0,And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate.
7122,-3,0,"We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border."
30019,-3,0,"We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not."
15425,-3,0,We must have a society that's just and fair.
27037,-3,0,"Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily."
12098,-3,0,"Well, I've got a plan to do something about that."
14937,-3,0,I'll have to get this out very fast.
25552,-3,0,"I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us."
209,-3,0,That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.
19287,-3,0,We'd like to have your support.
4401,-3,0,I don't think I need any on-the-job training.
15374,-3,0,"That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept."
22740,-3,0,That was the right place.
2071,-3,0,That is not a recipe for growth.
30124,-3,0,And I think that's great.
13310,-3,0,I have seen Communism abroad.
27628,-3,0,"I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan."
6742,-3,0,I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.
3285,-3,0,And let me make another observation.
16532,-3,0,The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.
21851,-3,0,I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.
444,-3,0,And I do believe it would be inhibiting.
30247,-3,0,It's not an accurate one.
27111,-3,0,That's exactly what we're doing.
17910,-3,0,That's not fair for our future.
1400,-3,0,I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is.
34399,-3,0,We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
3619,-3,0,"The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends."
17,-3,0,I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.
31935,-3,0,But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.
1497,-3,0,"So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair."
13188,-3,0,"My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return."
6360,-3,0,And that's what I intend to do as president.
17012,-3,0,"I owe everything to you, the people of this country."
507,-3,0,"And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me."
8130,-3,0,"I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts."
24843,-3,0,Take a look at the Middle East.
14148,-3,0,He got a notice or he didn't.
12547,-3,0,"That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area."
22060,-3,0,That is priority one in this country.
32137,-3,0,It's nice to -- one on three.
14498,-3,0,And it's a long list of specific items.
2658,-3,0,I don't just talk about it.
18078,-3,0,"And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands."
34044,-3,0,"And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never..."
15683,-3,0,And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.
18123,-3,0,And our alliance is strong.
11246,-3,0,We tend to be reactive.
4211,-3,0,"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""
14738,-3,0,"And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?"
202,-3,0,"I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens."
25242,-3,0,Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?
24186,-3,0,"Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that."
3572,-3,0,"And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow."
5506,-3,0,And so we've got to reverse this.
2506,-3,0,"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?"
23514,-3,0,But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.
3081,-3,0,So strong economy is very important.
260,-3,0,I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.
31895,-3,0,And they look and they see.
32503,-3,0,"I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality."
12059,-3,0,It's really a matter of culture.
19587,-3,0,We have to be able to make a difference.
12042,-3,0,"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that."
16348,-3,0,So let's not be throwing stones about it.
2876,-3,0,"Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight."
27281,-3,0,And those teachers can make a difference.
8247,-3,0,"I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."
17327,-3,0,But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?
33830,-3,0,And I think it's her campaign.
6292,-3,0,"As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available."
5984,-3,0,"Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now."
26527,-3,0,"In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be."
16031,-3,0,Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.
21067,-3,0,Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.
16595,-3,0,"When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government."
28878,-3,0,So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.
12851,-3,0,"We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago."
25685,-3,0,"In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century."
21959,-3,0,"But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US."
24415,-3,0,Use--work internationally to do it.
12774,-3,0,"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen."
24072,-3,0,We're trying to solve it.
26038,-3,0,"I knew it wouldn't work."""
23822,-3,0,This is a movement that came from the people.
10196,-3,0,But -- but it'll -- it'll -- it'll be...
6254,-3,0,But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.
33854,-3,0,Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.
13017,-3,0,"Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?"
22755,-3,0,But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.
32343,-3,0,Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?
28717,-3,0,"But if you can check up on them, that's real power."
89,-3,0,I asked for and received the same briefing.
8237,-3,0,"Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?"
29605,-3,0,"These are very fine institutions, very fine banks."
17892,-3,0,Will our children be better off?
11069,-3,0,Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.
754,-3,0,It is the best anti-terrorist report written.
2303,-3,0,You have to have regulation.
24643,-3,0,"But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote."
21650,-3,0,"Now, results is what counts."
19352,-3,0,And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.
1041,-3,0,I know I'm ready for it.
14815,-3,0,America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.
816,-3,0,And I think it's important to understand what happened here.
15099,-3,0,"First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing."
21271,-3,0,"I want to tell her, I'll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all."
26465,-3,0,"Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group."
15341,-3,0,"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party."
26766,-3,0,So we want to end discrimination.
5971,-3,0,You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.
26225,-3,0,But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.
8523,-3,0,I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.
27892,-3,0,They would have gone through a...
16388,-3,0,Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.
12191,-3,0,"So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know."
2211,-3,0,So that's -- that's number one.
26345,-3,0,We had a better idea.
15934,-3,0,"And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace."
33823,-3,0,Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?
27692,-3,0,We haven't done that yet.
22579,-3,0,I'm going to give you a tax cut.
1381,-3,0,So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.
21927,-3,0,Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates --
28488,-3,0,"Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today."

17314,-3,0,"These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that."
195,-3,0,I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.
12401,-3,0,And I'm going to try to do better.
33646,-3,0,I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.
24199,-3,0,"Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it."
7028,-3,0,I heard more of the same.
24999,-3,0,"And I made it plain to them, we're not."
34433,-3,0,"I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations."
33193,-3,0,But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.
4314,-3,0,We have to do a better job in human intelligence.
7161,-3,0,"But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """
30198,-3,0,I know how to win.
17768,-3,0,"If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan."
25042,-3,0,I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.
1150,-3,0,And I know that everybody uh - makes mistakes.
15191,-3,0,"It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican."
13679,-3,0,And I said I make a mistake.
5635,-3,0,"During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation."
20409,-3,0,"And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy."
21319,-3,0,"And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?"
24182,-3,0,There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.
13458,-3,0,"Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it."
19963,-3,0,They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.
3799,-3,0,And then the war was very badly mishandled.
7461,-3,0,And she speaks English a lot better than I do.
23630,-3,0,I'm trying to decipher that.
14466,-3,0,"Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess."
5930,-3,0,"And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families."
5495,-3,0,And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.
11807,-3,0,"The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing."
7751,-3,0,What tools do we need to fight us?
2065,-3,0,I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.
29648,-3,0,You call yourself the King of Debt.
8660,-3,0,"Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years."
22463,-3,0,"In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it."
1260,-3,0,"And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments."
22920,-3,0,We're going to build alliances.
14677,-3,0,"Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?"
29620,-3,0,And it's really a shame.
9880,-3,0,"The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident."
24770,-3,0,"Well, we can do better than that."
13457,-3,0,Why do we have a depletion allowance?
25826,-3,0,You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.
22135,-3,0,We have to have money to do that.
26850,-3,0,Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.
19124,-3,0,"Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties."
26528,-3,0,"If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing."
6312,-3,0,"I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future."
16383,-3,0,"We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us."
17608,-3,0,"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"
18848,-3,0,I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.
14628,-3,0,"And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children."
3456,-3,0,"We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while."
19011,-3,0,It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.
14342,-3,0,And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.
7152,-3,0,"And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear."
16018,-3,0,Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.
33524,-3,0,"Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way."
6579,-3,0,We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.
8218,-3,0,I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.
3136,-3,0,"So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so."
16059,-3,0,And I'm very proud of it.
9137,-3,0,"And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job."
32002,-3,0,"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses."
27723,-3,0,"But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules."
578,-3,0,"Well, I thought the question was about defense."
20809,-3,0,I want you to hear a problem weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got here in the USA.
21605,-3,0,And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.
13482,-3,0,Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.
33389,-3,0,There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.
8082,-3,0,The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.
11993,-3,0,I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.
14715,-3,0,That is my commitment to you.
23056,-3,0,"""I think that makes sense."
621,-3,0,"Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces."
18847,-3,0,And I share them with him.
2320,-3,0,So what did we do?
27031,-3,0,...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.
18591,-3,0,You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.
2041,-3,0,That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.
32582,-3,0,I will be the president and we will get it done.
25683,-3,0,I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.
28933,-3,0,I don't think that's right.
290,-3,0,I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.
5528,-3,0,"Last point I want to make, though."
8257,-3,0,"Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?"
7235,-3,0,And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.
14476,-3,0,"Now, if that's true, just tell me now."
7860,-3,0,In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.
11797,-3,0,"So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we do it this way, so should you.Ã¢â‚¬Â Now, we trust freedom."
14767,-3,0,"And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?"
17124,-3,0,And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.
11225,-3,0,"We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy."
25292,-3,0,"We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process."
7884,-3,0,In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.
12704,-3,0,They have to include the other countries of Latin America.
23724,-3,0,I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.
10092,-3,0,This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.
83,-3,0,"And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America."
20599,-3,0,But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.
25037,-3,0,"I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength."
18884,-3,0,He needed to be disarmed.
17323,-3,0,Let's take the example that the President cites.
10571,-3,0,We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.
105,-3,0,"Yes, I've been very specific about those, John."
12886,-3,0,We can put the Communists on the defensive.
25374,-3,0,What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?
123,-3,0,But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.
10741,-3,0,And the last point I just want to make.
12221,-3,0,"And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse."
2204,-3,0,And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.
8161,-3,0,Because they felt that the American society was moving again.
27229,-3,0,"Making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow."
4008,-3,0,And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.
20390,-3,0,He said all poor seniors.
29516,-3,0,You know what that is?
13932,-3,0,"I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world."
14174,-3,0,I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.
19424,-3,0,But it seems to me the record is clear.
7798,-3,0,"If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it."
28319,-3,0,"I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government."
34276,-3,0,I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.
3827,-3,0,"So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe."
27567,-3,0,"Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way."
31944,-3,0,"And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are."
17321,-3,0,And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.
2051,-3,0,"If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach."
13853,-3,0,"Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again."
960,-3,0,We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.
9876,-3,0,So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.
19158,-3,0,I guess I rely more on the individual.
14618,-3,0,"I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it."
21134,-3,0,"If you don't have trust in that, I do."
16242,-3,0,And so I don't know what the answer is.
29372,-3,0,"Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place."
26267,-3,0,"And as I said, this is not a partisan thing with me."
1540,-3,0,"During this campaign we've seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh - slogans of one kind or another."
30068,-3,0,She's been doing it a long time.
2575,-3,0,The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
9970,-3,0,I don't check it that often.
9323,-3,0,"How much did you cut them by, then?"
27858,-3,0,Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.
13476,-3,0,"Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar."
22,-3,0,"And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction."
29192,-3,0,"What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing."
20024,-3,0,This is an issue they've brought up.
26458,-3,0,I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.
82,-3,0,We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.
3903,-3,0,"We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate."
15753,-3,0,"And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions."
32426,-3,0,"But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin."
10718,-3,0,"And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later."
4328,-3,0,We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.
919,-3,0,"I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction."
23171,-3,0,"You're right, what does matter is a plan."
26361,-3,0,But there's a better way to do it.
8024,-3,0,"But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa."
7783,-3,0,"I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency."
17450,-3,0,"And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife."
33686,-3,0,I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.
7961,-3,0,You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.
19390,-3,0,"Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics."
244,-3,0,We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.
2582,-3,0,That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.
7213,-3,0,You don't measure it by a percentage increase.
3773,-3,0,We have to obviously cut spending.
5537,-3,0,And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.
29139,-3,0,"With the United States, as he said, not so much."
8031,-3,0,I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.
4390,-3,0,"And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that."
18408,-3,0,So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.
32986,-3,0,But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.
5664,-3,0,"But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill."
1259,-3,0,And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.
29575,-3,0,Who does he owe money to?
20118,-3,0,"He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress."
16642,-3,0,"So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan."
17034,-3,0,We must make this next century the century of the individual.
17793,-3,0,"Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work."
22451,-3,0,Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.
18428,-3,0,I've been -- but I'll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people.
3922,-3,0,He did not say that.
6964,-3,0,"And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions."
13645,-3,0,The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.
21560,-3,0,The ideas I express are mine.
5998,-3,0,And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.
28387,-3,0,"If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit."
9082,-3,0,What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.
10508,-3,0,Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.
4023,-3,0,"That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed."
24748,-3,0,The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities.
29441,-3,0,Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.
7643,-3,0,And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.
10679,-3,0,"Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list."
1565,-3,0,"Our people are out of work, and there's a sense of withdrawal."
19962,-3,0,"The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them."
1130,-3,0,"And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago."
14568,-3,0,"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."
27103,-3,0,We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.
34043,-3,0,She should not be allowed to run.
24220,-3,0,"We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have."
22164,-3,0,We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.
8956,-3,0,"I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan."
25045,-3,0,A President must know those things.
15333,-3,0,I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.
12820,-3,0,"But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue."
27185,-3,0,"And, finally, we have to stand by our principles."
23042,-3,0,"Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs."
15312,-3,0,"Well, that just isn't true."
16064,-3,0,And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.
10559,-3,0,"So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers."
24588,-3,0,"But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up."
32103,-3,0,"And so please, go to..."
15048,-3,0,They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.
12367,-3,0,I feel very strongly the same place.
4132,-3,0,"And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant."
28764,-3,0,We better get it right now.
666,-3,0,But this is an exciting time.
8759,-3,0,"So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that."
9929,-3,0,He was asked this on Univision the other day.
11221,-3,0,"Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union."
15799,-3,0,"I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids."
28981,-3,0,"I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected."
3888,-3,0,"That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic."
12475,-3,0,This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.
6140,-3,0,I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.
17578,-3,0,I'm not going to increase taxes.
15435,-3,0,And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.
9133,-3,0,They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.
7420,-3,0,"And as president, I am committed to changing that."
17273,-3,0,"I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact."
17366,-3,0,"I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause."
13429,-3,0,"And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more."
18859,-3,0,And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.
7916,-3,0,Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.
26756,-3,0,"All over the world, people are being torn apart -- Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi -- you name it -- because of all their differences."
15564,-3,0,The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks.
18533,-3,0,"I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are."
25883,-3,0,The President told you in '92 he would cut it 67 billion.
3268,-3,0,The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.
12828,-3,0,"Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference."
27408,-3,0,"And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips."
10119,-3,0,Most recently out in Aurora.
16489,-3,0,"I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars."
16743,-3,0,Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.
16178,-3,0,I've been to these national parks.
31876,-3,0,"But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it."
21445,-3,0,"We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC."
18566,-3,0,And these are the things you have to think through.
13299,-3,0,I disapprove of the issue.
4040,-3,0,You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.
5855,-3,0,And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.
25619,-3,0,"I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely."
6060,-3,0,We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.
14583,-3,0,That's what worries me --
19558,-3,0,"We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests."
17695,-3,0,I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.
27586,-3,0,"They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension..."
3967,-3,0,I can see how tough that terrain is.
23105,-3,0,And you'll find a tort reform plan.
18173,-3,0,And there are a long list of thing.
8433,-3,0,"I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility."
12848,-3,0,"I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing."
27261,-3,0,We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.
9867,-3,0,I want it to be streamlined.
682,-3,0,Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990Ãâ‚¬s and beyond.
25837,-3,0,We need to help people who are between jobs.
10596,-3,0,"If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts."
3961,-3,0,"Now, you don't do that."
33314,-3,0,But they know what's going on.
3026,-3,0,I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.
5908,-3,0,It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.
14636,-3,0,"Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums."
618,-3,0,I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.
17290,-3,0,"And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it."
33462,-3,0,"She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama."
27371,-3,0,I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.
28208,-3,0,Trying to find my light.
19673,-3,0,"I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package."
19777,-3,0,That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.
20836,-3,0,That's my vision for public education all around America.
17206,-3,0,"You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job."
17774,-3,0,And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.
15172,-3,0,"You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake."
1980,-3,0,"Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts."
26343,-3,0,We have to help people succeed at home and at work.
26570,-3,0,I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.
3436,-3,0,"Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes."
1909,-3,0,My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.
27090,-3,0,"And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it."
11334,-3,0,"Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish."
17220,-3,0,"We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need."
12174,-3,0,I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.
17379,-3,0,But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.
33098,-3,0,It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.
15407,-3,0,"Those would all, could all be challenged by men."
5641,-3,0,But -- OK. All right.
20420,-3,0,I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.
24672,-3,0,"-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people."
28140,-3,0,I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.
10292,-3,0,We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.
33318,-3,0,I was up in New Hampshire the other day.
1995,-3,0,"Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that."
3667,-3,0,"Again, you can look it up."
8993,-3,0,"Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival."
30417,-3,0,"You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials."
18218,-3,0,America needed to be safe.
34434,-3,0,"I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college."
28605,-3,0,"And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment."
2549,-3,0,"But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed."
745,-3,0,"So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same."
491,-3,0,I think it is good.
16716,-3,0,"And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power."
8525,-3,0,"We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert."
24935,-3,0,"Now, those are the details as we have them."
24461,-3,0,"Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family."
23753,-3,0,I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.
1774,-3,0,"My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit."
11500,-3,0,I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.
1036,-3,0,We can also have a- an end to the extremes.
27214,-3,0,"So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military."
33235,-3,0,"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment."
11028,-3,0,"I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified."
15848,-3,0,And I would cite again Dan Quayle.
6372,-3,0,"My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America."
23644,-3,0,I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.
16233,-3,0,"In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it."
293,-3,0,And I don't agree with them.
3968,-3,0,It's ruled by a handful of tribes.
9027,-3,0,"With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all."
13023,-3,0,But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.
3437,-3,0,"And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country."
25747,-3,0,They see scandals almost on a daily basis.
10830,-3,0,"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us."""
14566,-3,0,"If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs."
8595,-3,0,It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.
32913,-3,0,"Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning."
8424,-3,0,"We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries."
14950,-3,0,I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.
7655,-3,0,"And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership."
33362,-3,0,So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.
15310,-3,0,That is the way it will stay.
32278,-3,0,"And before you solve it, you have to say the name."
30109,-3,0,They were choking on the sanctions.
34411,-3,0,That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.
28567,-3,0,Let me tell you my position.
21202,-3,0,I've campaigned on this since the primaries.
26836,-3,0,Could have a chance to serve as president.
29408,-3,0,She's telling us how to fight ISIS.
3484,-3,0,"So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term."
24204,-3,0,"This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated."
26195,-3,0,"We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for."
12994,-3,0,Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.
2110,-3,0,"And, finally, Medicaid to states?"
5823,-3,0,"The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth."
18850,-3,0,And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.
32238,-3,0,"You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry."
27488,-3,0,"And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China."
25635,-3,0,"They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it."
28792,-3,0,I'm going to find people that want to serve their country.
32135,-3,0,And it hasn't been finished at all.
8232,-3,0,I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.
8612,-3,0,The means are at issue.
2128,-3,0,"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position."
3208,-3,0,And I believe that we used our skill.
2241,-3,0,One last point I want to make.
7520,-3,0,"And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene."
20539,-3,0,I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.
12897,-3,0,"If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won."
17767,-3,0,Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?
9690,-3,0,Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.
29810,-3,0,I'd like to respond to that.
23566,-3,0,I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.
9447,-3,0,"'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now."
14126,-3,0,"You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have."
22464,-3,0,"Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess."
25764,-3,0,My word is my bond.
22452,-3,0,Starting when they're 3 and going to this school until they're 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade.
8604,-3,0,Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.
17429,-3,0,"There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up."
23450,-3,0,"You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie."
13741,-3,0,"I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this."
13022,-3,0,"We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice."
26750,-3,0,It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.
322,-3,0,"Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism."
32778,-3,0,"The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq."
6775,-3,0,I believe that choice is a woman's choice.
26770,-3,0,And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.
11885,-3,0,Is anybody being discriminated against?
16202,-3,0,I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.
1999,-3,0,"But in my view, the president should have grabbed it."
25040,-3,0,He's 3 years into this administration.
13259,-3,0,What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.
25584,-3,0,This evening we talked about national strength.
3424,-3,0,I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.
24755,-3,0,"Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan."
16520,-3,0,And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.
19363,-3,0,But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.
629,-3,0,But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.
1004,-3,0,"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have."
19552,-3,0,There will always be problems in this whole world.
20283,-3,0,I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.
22928,-3,0,"Let me answer what he just said, about around the world."
27467,-3,0,I would indict him for it.
10203,-3,0,When -- when he was asked would class size...
17369,-3,0,The President says it'll disappear automatically.
26632,-3,0,"See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job."
20492,-3,0,I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.
18938,-3,0,"And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia."
15047,-3,0,"But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end."
22272,-3,0,It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.
2920,-3,0,This is a responsibility of the president.
17842,-3,0,"Well, we'll include it in that."
12466,-3,0,"There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C."
6321,-3,0,And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.
23221,-3,0,That's the way we leave it.
307,-3,0,"And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus."
27958,-3,0,"Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy."
21510,-3,0,So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.
4042,-3,0,"And when I'm president, I will."
14404,-3,0,"I said well, this is simple."
2737,-3,0,What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.
21366,-3,0,If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.
4394,-3,0,And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.
33327,-3,0,We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.
9022,-3,0,"But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite."
23996,-3,0,"I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people."
22460,-3,0,And we have got to put our nation back to work.
11573,-3,0,"Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor."
23452,-3,0,"I'm not going to, because that would be pandering."
26821,-3,0,What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.
14413,-3,0,"Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream."
2022,-3,0,It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.
5583,-3,0,"But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it."
6327,-3,0,"It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective."
18375,-3,0,"I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in."
1847,-3,0,"And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy."
7807,-3,0,This we must get across to the world.
18550,-3,0,Now that's what we have to do.
3305,-3,0,I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.
6478,-3,0,"Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world."
10735,-3,0,"We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling."
8662,-3,0,The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.
1031,-3,0,"And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now."
4415,-3,0,"I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends."
16736,-3,0,So mandatory conservation measures - yes.
15526,-3,0,They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.
15026,-3,0,It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.
9645,-3,0,"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?"
16341,-3,0,"I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service."
28862,-3,0,"If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that."
27874,-3,0,...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...
24139,-3,0,"But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before."
34414,-3,0,"So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse."
300,-3,0,Governor Thompson of Illinois did.
6406,-3,0,I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.
716,-3,0,Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.
25310,-3,0,"And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people."
10771,-3,0,"I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad."
20237,-3,0,"I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country."
28055,-3,0,"It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though."
26066,-3,0,It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.
18988,-3,0,And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.
15169,-3,0,The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.
15686,-3,0,"I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better."
18793,-3,0,"Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support."
28369,-3,0,I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.
15811,-3,0,I think of Dr. Fauci.
28194,-3,0,There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.
8321,-3,0,I think this is the wrong direction.
21794,-3,0,"If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought."
582,-3,0,That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.
12222,-3,0,The horse is up here now.
13007,-3,0,"Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one."
25814,-3,0,I have heard you say this time after time.
8787,-3,0,And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.
1877,-3,0,He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.
7792,-3,0,I think the United States can afford to do these things.
23436,-3,0,He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.
8317,-3,0,I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.
5948,-3,0,"But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength."
32189,-3,0,It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.
28760,-3,0,They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.
23154,-3,0,It would ruin the quality of health care in America.
16256,-3,0,"(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?"
24805,-3,0,That's Washington in a nutshell right there.
1419,-3,0,And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.
15452,-3,0,"And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for."
26571,-3,0,I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress.
20868,-3,0,I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.
22029,-3,0,Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.
21854,-3,0,I think medical care should go with the person.
10979,-3,0,"We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice."
4340,-3,0,That's going to be critical.
22197,-3,0,"But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things."
16239,-3,0,"And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper."
10507,-3,0,The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.
28258,-3,0,"I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond."
1502,-3,0,That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.
8498,-3,0,"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs."
30369,-3,0,You asked me a question.
19556,-3,0,Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.
1175,-3,0,I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.
17374,-3,0,"As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength."
5492,-3,0,"They're hurting, and they're angry."
2086,-3,0,"... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas."
14992,-3,0,"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?"
27675,-3,0,We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.
20070,-3,0,That's what this race is all about.
22459,-3,0,"Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water."
10698,-3,0,And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.
29595,-3,0,You learn a lot from financial disclosure.
15573,-3,0,"Ann, the Vice President made that pledge."
14470,-3,0,"Now, in 1984 they were told."
11824,-3,0,"I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level."
26846,-3,0,"I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility."
20135,-3,0,"It is not midnight in America, Senator."
22470,-3,0,But it's in your hands.
238,-3,0,I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.
10737,-3,0,We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.
9967,-3,0,"You know, I -- I don't look at my pension."
22144,-3,0,"Now, the other superpowers need to do their part."
7985,-3,0,Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.
6099,-3,0,"You won't pay a fine, because..."
16833,-3,0,"The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can."
13119,-3,0,"And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace."
17889,-3,0,That's what the economists tell us.
28640,-3,0,I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.
868,-3,0,"Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years."
6152,-3,0,And don't take my word for it.
16948,-3,0,"But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto."
2222,-3,0,"If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company."
12894,-3,0,I would just like to s- add this one point.
19128,-3,0,And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.
29225,-3,0,"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck."
3894,-3,0,"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer."
8083,-3,0,It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.
13021,-3,0,We're on the side of freedom.
18470,-3,0,"As the politics change, his positions change."
28870,-3,0,You're not going to be targeted in or targeted out.
1843,-3,0,"Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth."
28401,-3,0,"Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me."
24691,-3,0,"Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple."
25420,-3,0,It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.
23038,-3,0,"One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker."
8942,-3,0,"Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance."
19105,-3,0,Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.
29847,-3,0,"Look, one murder is too many."
12566,-3,0,"And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny."
22157,-3,0,And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.
28379,-3,0,He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.
6772,-3,0,"But I disagree with them, as do many."
28186,-3,0,I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.
18935,-3,0,In the hands of a terrorist enemy.
27259,-3,0,"Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind."
3797,-3,0,I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.
5655,-3,0,I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.
5853,-3,0,"And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues."
9422,-3,0,"Candy, it's not going to --"
15528,-3,0,And so I'm proud of my choice.
15987,-3,0,The Congress is doing a better job of it.
29319,-3,0,And I have done a lot...
26943,-3,0,That's not the right course for us.
26633,-3,0,And that's the economic package again.
18725,-3,0,"And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us."
17128,-3,0,What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.
19432,-3,0,This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.
26413,-3,0,"I don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make new promises in an election year."
22191,-3,0,And the schools that are not chosen are improved -- competition does that.
6602,-3,0,And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?
2063,-3,0,And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.
12842,-3,0,"I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be."
21315,-3,0,If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.
12563,-3,0,But all this by itself is not enough.
17099,-3,0,"And when they meet, that is a balanced budget."
2618,-3,0,"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now."
243,-3,0,"And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure."
21010,-3,0,"But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago."
27236,-3,0,"We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more."
2529,-3,0,One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.
22458,-3,0,And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.
14291,-3,0,"I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer."
11090,-3,0,I've been in them all my life.
3690,-3,0,"We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off."
16885,-3,0,"For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like."
6320,-3,0,Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.
27174,-3,0,"When the -- when the president of Iraq -- excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that's a frightening thing."
19642,-3,0,So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.
24541,-3,0,"Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand."
22645,-3,0,He wants you to believe that I can't be president.
18904,-3,0,And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.
9735,-3,0,But the last point I want to make is this.
12612,-3,0,"That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago."
27448,-3,0,"Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America."
10734,-3,0,I believe in the need for increased oil production.
26351,-3,0,"This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government."
33424,-3,0,Ronald Reagan was the last president...
21480,-3,0,And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.
15409,-3,0,I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.
22107,-3,0,And you hear all the bad stuff that's happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind.
19931,-3,0,"You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President."
9718,-3,0,My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.
19059,-3,0,I appreciate your listening tonight.
12060,-3,0,It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.
11429,-3,0,"But our real power comes, I think, from our values."
15990,-3,0,The American working man and woman are not taxed too little.
21590,-3,0,"I'm not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven't seen this, because there's been a lot of hue and cry."
20344,-3,0,"He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble."
7533,-3,0,"Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods."
7415,-3,0,That's not where we are today.
21251,-3,0,I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.
18258,-3,0,You've got to help us over there.
8618,-3,0,And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.
13910,-3,0,"And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it."
23969,-3,0,"Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000."
25145,-3,0,"-- me, or your own eyes?''"
26517,-3,0,"Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world."
7977,-3,0,I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.
23646,-3,0,Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.
14733,-3,0,"And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?"
2060,-3,0,"My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it."
2058,-3,0,Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?
22454,-3,0,Now that will change America.
19492,-3,0,"Well, the President doesn't have it quite right."
8116,-3,0,"The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom."
8856,-3,0,"But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed."
24948,-3,0,What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?
20089,-3,0,I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.
8958,-3,0,We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.
21157,-3,0,It's time for a new look.
12632,-3,0,In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.
14312,-3,0,-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.
28874,-3,0,"You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options."
8592,-3,0,Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.
2569,-3,0,"Well, first, I love great schools."
2798,-3,0,We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy.
13986,-3,0,"And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people."
20687,-3,0,"But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place."
12212,-3,0,We're working hard to sign up children.
2808,-3,0,"The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight."
11837,-3,0,"And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas."
2544,-3,0,"Well, I definitely think there are differences."
23869,-3,0,And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.
6518,-3,0,We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.
34080,-3,0,He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.
18480,-3,0,There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.
7410,-3,0,"Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may."
24863,-3,0,And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job.
2892,-3,0,I've talked to them and I've listened.
11515,-3,0,"But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East."
12705,-3,0,"The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe."
19674,-3,0,"There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered."
6170,-3,0,And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.
16905,-3,0,Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.
32762,-3,0,"I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force."
3359,-3,0,Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?
1944,-3,0,"Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?"
25051,-3,0,We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.
20662,-3,0,"If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world."
2133,-3,0,"You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me."
2367,-3,0,And -- and we've got to deal with cost.
15375,-3,0,It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.
11332,-3,0,The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.
6289,-3,0,So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.
22434,-3,0,"If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider."
6487,-3,0,I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.
19211,-3,0,"How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children."
15670,-3,0,And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.
18969,-3,0,And I will continue working with him over the next four years.
19398,-3,0,"And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President."
19668,-3,0,"Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now."
11082,-3,0,That requires a cool hand at the tiller.
15240,-3,0,"I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that."
7675,-3,0,These are the great questions: equality of education in school.
1331,-3,0,"So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters."
18190,-3,0,I'm going to do it in four years.
29290,-3,0,I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.
432,-3,0,I don't think it's a good thing.
25070,-3,0,I'll tell you where we disagree.
16540,-3,0,I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.
13329,-3,0,"I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes."
11740,-3,0,And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.
17365,-3,0,"And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics."
27068,-3,0,"Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is."
28262,-3,0,I strongly believe in local control of schools.
34053,-3,0,"Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying."
13533,-3,0,Let's look at the other side of the coin.
26703,-3,0,You ought to make more decisions.
2839,-3,0,I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.
5914,-3,0,"Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go."
10935,-3,0,And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.
24859,-3,0,And we need to strengthen the American family.
28879,-3,0,You're going to live in a peaceful world.
610,-3,0,"I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game."
800,-3,0,It's only on yellow here.
26453,-3,0,"Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things."
3829,-3,0,And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.
2641,-3,0,I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.
3035,-3,0,"I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries."
22654,-3,0,I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.
13924,-3,0,"Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs."
21497,-3,0,"When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true."
13489,-3,0,"We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about."
20161,-3,0,"It's important, it's their future."
10088,-3,0,"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?"
405,-3,0,"When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?"
21001,-3,0,"No, there's no difference on that."
23528,-3,0,"Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again."
25903,-3,0,I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.
22122,-3,0,"And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security."
3751,-3,0,"It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close."
14107,-3,0,"I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country."
675,-3,0,"Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not."
11135,-3,0,... just a quick follow-up on this.
3680,-3,0,"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed."
3854,-3,0,"But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war."
3856,-3,0,You talk about the surge.
12016,-3,0,"But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free."
29233,-3,0,"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago."
30407,-3,0,Where did you find this?
25266,-3,0,"One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, ""Deadly Gambits.''"
10133,-3,0,Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.
8061,-3,0,It's what we stand for.
8036,-3,0,But it didn't mean that.
9278,-3,0,"Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables."
20133,-3,0,"Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education."
32855,-3,0,"To go back to the very, very first question."
19122,-3,0,"And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight."
27029,-3,0,Governor -- here -- here's -- here's one thing...
16030,-3,0,And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.
24125,-3,0,"I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do."
18117,-3,0,He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.
3101,-3,0,"They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first."
15372,-3,0,"But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept."
15058,-3,0,"This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly."
21165,-3,0,I want to focus on results.
7291,-3,0,"I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old."
12727,-3,0,"The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power."
33466,-3,0,He said nice things about me.
314,-3,0,My parents came to this country as immigrants.
27156,-3,0,"You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system."
24680,-3,0,"Now, everybody will faint in Washington."
1009,-3,0,"I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people."
13002,-3,0,"It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world."
22462,-3,0,I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.
20419,-3,0,It's an issue I know a lot about.
2499,-3,0,"Now, that also means that you've got more customers."
6510,-3,0,"No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected."
12396,-3,0,"That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case."
13871,-3,0,That's one of the things I want to change.
22924,-3,0,Let me just -- I've got to answer this.
20998,-3,0,My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.
14538,-3,0,Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.
24029,-3,0,"But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace."
15493,-3,0,And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.
28523,-3,0,"We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace."
10957,-3,0,Let's have community health centers.
24864,-3,0,"Thank you very, very much."
28688,-3,0,We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.
16674,-3,0,We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.
13029,-3,0,"It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster."
18705,-3,0,"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test."
641,-3,0,But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.
31961,-3,0,"She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later."
6343,-3,0,"And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism."
25440,-3,0,"Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess."
28224,-3,0,"But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met."
24774,-3,0,"If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done."
6242,-3,0,I think it's always a tragic situation.
7650,-3,0,I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.
22251,-3,0,"If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home -- nothing will ever replace that."
299,-3,0,"You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill."
31947,-3,0,And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.
27072,-3,0,It's their route to the sea.
10738,-3,0,"But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings."
20502,-3,0,Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.
18195,-3,0,"Anyway, that's for another debate."
16027,-3,0,"The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting."
23521,-3,0,"I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously."
26555,-3,0,"Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible."
16882,-3,0,But I think the feeling is misplaced.
8620,-3,0,"And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States."
8390,-3,0,"Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries."
32984,-3,0,I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.
22008,-3,0,It's still the most respected credit.
8241,-3,0,"And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans."
27654,-3,0,And what we've said is let's change those certifications.
396,-3,0,"Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so."
11425,-3,0,So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.
9472,-3,0,Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.
33632,-3,0,"Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are."
4024,-3,0,And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.
9342,-3,0,And so what we did was take away those leases.
19816,-3,0,So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.
28510,-3,0,"It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops."
25497,-3,0,And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.
2992,-3,0,"For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind."
19787,-3,0,"I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge."
117,-3,0,"We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again."
17211,-3,0,"And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue."
10496,-3,0,"He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today."
30320,-3,0,Would he have started a war?
5700,-3,0,"Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget."
5974,-3,0,"Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe."
21171,-3,0,I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.
30064,-3,0,We will take out ISIS.
19379,-3,0,I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.
25769,-3,0,"It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan, Republican, Democrat, left, right, liberal, conservative."
28883,-3,0,"You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood."
25895,-3,0,But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.
24937,-3,0,We'll take the proper action at the proper time.
19585,-3,0,The interests of the American people must be at stake.
8294,-3,0,"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos."
25891,-3,0,Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.
20019,-3,0,And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.
23590,-3,0,So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.
24829,-3,0,"Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again."
20735,-3,0,I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.
3807,-3,0,"And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy."
22028,-3,0,"Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once."
22765,-3,0,I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.
16340,-3,0,I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.
20131,-3,0,I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.
12361,-3,0,"And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place."
24522,-3,0,"Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, we're going to have some blunt talks about this, and we're really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk won't do it, folks."
24955,-3,0,A President must know these things.
6344,-3,0,And we'll care for these young children.
33803,-3,0,"And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria."
1599,-3,0,"I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things."
5790,-3,0,That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.
21797,-3,0,"And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign."
6561,-3,0,"But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it."
7296,-3,0,I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.
1655,-3,0,I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.
7653,-3,0,"Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools."
17173,-3,0,And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.
19215,-3,0,I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.
1052,-3,0,And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.
29469,-3,0,Who gave it that name?
27100,-3,0,And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.
6077,-3,0,We need to have more community health centers.
33769,-3,0,And you do have experience.
32543,-3,0,"See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president."
25516,-3,0,"And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States."
15373,-3,0,"And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today."
4397,-3,0,And they know that I'll take care of them.
28468,-3,0,"I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army."
7156,-3,0,And that's to make sure the education system works.
14672,-3,0,I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.
33093,-3,0,"I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that."
17131,-3,0,"Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession."
24949,-3,0,He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.
2468,-3,0,"Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description."
32129,-3,0,"I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?"
18225,-3,0,"But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again."
17712,-3,0,The interest rates are based on inflation.
3428,-3,0,"And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?"
6764,-3,0,"And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately."
17847,-3,0,"Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again."
8220,-3,0,They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.
14392,-3,0,It's a sick art form.
22367,-3,0,This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.
10443,-3,0,And so now we've got to take some decisive action.
6679,-3,0,"Plus, we need fiscal discipline."
23212,-3,0,Thank you for your question.
24563,-3,0,"See, our differences are our strengths."
709,-3,0,"And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all."
16320,-3,0,So I am one who believes that we can
1598,-3,0,"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."""
32188,-3,0,"And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country."
27245,-3,0,And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.
12542,-3,0,"Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you."
22773,-3,0,And people in Europe didn't like that decision.
18900,-3,0,We have to do this job.
14622,-3,0,What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.
20257,-3,0,It's a difference of opinion.
26472,-3,0,"But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important."
7443,-3,0,And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.
10724,-3,0,"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."""
15016,-3,0,"When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation."
7747,-3,0,Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.
8028,-3,0,But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.
20717,-3,0,"When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father."
20160,-3,0,"And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with."
14836,-3,0,"Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office."
2459,-3,0,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance."
19402,-3,0,"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened."
16148,-3,0,"I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation."
11459,-3,0,"We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people."
2738,-3,0,"And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate."
27966,-3,0,"Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you."
4044,-3,0,"You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman."
31921,-3,0,"We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again."
16773,-3,0,"And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country."
12410,-3,0,I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong.
29942,-3,0,And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.
8526,-3,0,"I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat."
22252,-3,0,"You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that?"
17907,-3,0,I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.
6019,-3,0,But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.
27855,-3,0,"This is a company, this isn't basic research."
22608,-3,0,And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force.
1299,-3,0,And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.
18163,-3,0,But that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden.
26751,-3,0,"I would wind up -- I mean, it's the last question and I would mischaracterize it to try to make you happy."
19633,-3,0,And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.
5565,-3,0,"In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around."
1553,-3,0,I've been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times.
9739,-3,0,He didn't call for self-deportation.
11880,-3,0,We can do better in our public schools.
23931,-3,0,"If you make it as a young man, time passes."
26470,-3,0,"But as far as special rights, I'm opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning in the dark of night."
2393,-3,0,And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.
11172,-3,0,I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.
18805,-3,0,"And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly."
24800,-3,0,Isn't it time to do it?
11013,-3,0,"And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you."
6083,-3,0,"But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit."
22306,-3,0,"Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better."
24308,-3,0,"And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil."
29944,-3,0,And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.
32287,-3,0,"My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community."
18820,-3,0,We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.
15575,-3,0,So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.
28594,-3,0,You know what the bad news is that follows on that.
21973,-3,0,"When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it."
22449,-3,0,I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.
23924,-3,0,I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way.
25496,-3,0,"Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran."
295,-3,0,I don't agree with that.
24087,-3,0,"(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear."
24716,-3,0,I just don't believe we ought to do that.
16313,-3,0,"Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?"
18235,-3,0,Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.
17916,-3,0,The question is our future.
19046,-3,0,We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.
24206,-3,0,Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.
7729,-3,0,"And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks."
26683,-3,0,This is what Ross Perot complains about.

24446,-3,0,"A good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted (sic) from the elders to the children, a place where people turn for refuge, and where they know they're the most important people in the world."
18511,-3,0,That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.
30197,-3,0,I have a winning temperament.
2456,-3,0,Let me make one last point.
8205,-3,0,What has happened to you?
27445,-3,0,"Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel."
6492,-3,0,We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.
14382,-3,0,And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.
23907,-3,0,"They get on me -- Bill's gotten on me about, ""read my lips."""
10686,-3,0,"Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done."
12384,-3,0,I mention the last debate --
34182,-3,0,This is what we have to do.
7948,-3,0,I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.
14029,-3,0,"But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us."
19731,-3,0,"Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?"
24084,-3,0,"We've got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them."
14462,-3,0,And I have proposed that.
27995,-3,0,I'm convinced we'll do it.
23363,-3,0,"But if you're a president, it's not."
12464,-3,0,I'm running to get some things done for America.
17773,-3,0,"I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82."
10952,-3,0,"Well, thank you for the question."
324,-3,0,"I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment."
30279,-3,0,"I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over."
16700,-3,0,I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.
9037,-3,0,"Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening."
13316,-3,0,We cannot have it in our hearts.
16522,-3,0,"And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly."
25823,-3,0,Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.
32557,-3,0,"Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson."
2564,-3,0,"I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help."
8154,-3,0,It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.
17894,-3,0,"I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership."
17024,-3,0,It calls for more of the same.
6694,-3,0,"The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage."
34243,-3,0,But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.
26603,-3,0,You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.
28092,-3,0,And I believe I can.
24850,-3,0,Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.
23679,-3,0,He shouldn't have made that decision.
11986,-3,0,I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to.
1532,-3,0,"I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents."
23926,-3,0,Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.
2914,-3,0,"I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt."
16994,-3,0,"For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to."
16017,-3,0,We do not have to do it.
19690,-3,0,Was it the right thing to do?
17037,-3,0,The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.
2615,-3,0,And it wasn't very detailed.
30222,-3,0,That's working with other nations.
8977,-3,0,"And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state."
11561,-3,0,"Now, there's more work to do."
5549,-3,0,I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.
28308,-3,0,It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.
19820,-3,0,"And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends."
4145,-3,0,The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.
23914,-3,0,And I don't think most Americans could do that.
3300,-3,0,I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.
11173,-3,0,"I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran."
7399,-3,0,And we're struggling with that today.
19590,-3,0,When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.
2132,-3,0,"But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now."
13187,-3,0,What do we do then?
22407,-3,0,May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.
5918,-3,0,"Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin."
20030,-3,0,Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.
8204,-3,0,But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.
12538,-3,0,"But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world."
24677,-3,0,"So I welcome that challenge, and just watch --"
30083,-3,0,"And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that."
21948,-3,0,"It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC."
11530,-3,0,I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.
25919,-3,0,But let's sort of keep this out of politics because it's pretty dicey right now.
22553,-3,0,"Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir."
32905,-3,0,"By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi."
16904,-3,0,"But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might."
6776,-3,0,"It's between a woman, God and her doctor."
32449,-3,0,"But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns."
32104,-3,0,"Oh, you didn't delete them?"
14541,-3,0,And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?
1977,-3,0,"You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise."
6950,-3,0,"Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that."
20429,-3,0,"I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein."
8224,-3,0,"We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time."
19954,-3,0,It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.
434,-3,0,The question is who makes the decision.
8492,-3,0,"We cannot, of course, control the Senate."
2714,-3,0,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it."
24634,-3,0,Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.
7883,-3,0,"Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility."
6039,-3,0,"If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century."
7784,-3,0,This permits them to maintain their self-respect.
22259,-3,0,Everybody told me they were cost-effective.
28233,-3,0,I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.
11700,-3,0,First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.
34296,-3,0,We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.
2905,-3,0,"But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world."
17017,-3,0,"On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision."
5507,-3,0,We ought to put the homeowners first.
25778,-3,0,"When we do that, instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, we're a better country and that's why we're making progress now."
19189,-3,0,But are the American people?
25273,-3,0,"They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress."
30086,-3,0,That's the most important part of this.
21782,-3,0,"I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now."
477,-3,0,"Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have."
31933,-3,0,"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women."
559,-3,0,"And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt."
11790,-3,0,"But take Russia, for example."
6931,-3,0,We have a fundamental difference of opinion.
9963,-3,0,"Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?"
11119,-3,0,Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.
15220,-3,0,"It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy."
21145,-3,0,The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.
25400,-3,0,We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.
27441,-3,0,"They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table."
4025,-3,0,I know what thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like when an army is defeated.
23608,-3,0,I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.
17250,-3,0,"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term."
34246,-3,0,It is so sad when you see what's happened.
1314,-3,0,We - quite often we have a transient problem.
7997,-3,0,And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.
7833,-3,0,So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.
22496,-3,0,We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.
24061,-3,0,Mr. Bush talked about taxes.
20168,-3,0,"I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America."
7597,-3,0,There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.
6277,-3,0,"They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need."
21164,-3,0,You may want to focus on scandal.
27900,-3,0,"No, I am not wrong."
12836,-3,0,We do not help it.
11640,-3,0,And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.
30190,-3,0,You didn't hear what I said.
25459,-3,0,Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.
24610,-3,0,"Call me, let me know."""
28780,-3,0,I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.
149,-3,0,"And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control."
25339,-3,0,"But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration."
17466,-3,0,"So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this."
26758,-3,0,You see it in the church burnings.
8384,-3,0,"In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960."
3890,-3,0,"Jim, Jim, this is a big..."
19031,-3,0,That's the country that I'm going to fight for.
32645,-3,0,"I hate to interrupt you, but at some point..."
894,-3,0,I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.
25199,-3,0,"So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?"
23000,-3,0,I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.
10181,-3,0,"But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts."
18588,-3,0,He is the leader of that country.
21852,-3,0,It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.
11676,-3,0,I don't think we agree on that.
5795,-3,0,"And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college."
5779,-3,0,And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.
23567,-3,0,"Plus, I want them all voting for me."
25776,-3,0,This is an historic time.
6193,-3,0,It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.
34329,-3,0,"We've become very, very sloppy."
21259,-3,0,"Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet."
26601,-3,0,"We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system."
12830,-3,0,"By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved."
3269,-3,0,And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.
9878,-3,0,I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.
3508,-3,0,And I promise you that that will happen.
1033,-3,0,"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""
16175,-3,0,"But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit."
18578,-3,0,We have to start to spend the money now.
26122,-3,0,"So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about."
23364,-3,0,"Let me just say to you, number one, don't throw the labels around."
27584,-3,0,"I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel."
8225,-3,0,"Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims."
2074,-3,0,"Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions."
25583,-3,0,"I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening."
3288,-3,0,"And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving."
19723,-3,0,It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.
13511,-3,0,There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.
16298,-3,0,"An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons."
24075,-3,0,"I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question."
1089,-3,0,I think the matter is settled once and for all.
5493,-3,0,"They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry."
23882,-3,0,I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.
7999,-3,0,"Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost."
27512,-3,0,I think they noticed that as well.
16535,-3,0,"But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president."
11227,-3,0,"Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others."
17393,-3,0,And I think this is something the American people see.
10873,-3,0,It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.
14456,-3,0,"It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was."
15723,-3,0,"Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up."
12009,-3,0,And I'm going to make it a priority.
6472,-3,0,"I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them."
17256,-3,0,"So, it does play a part in my life."
28171,-3,0,"Now, we have a big difference on this."
16284,-3,0,"In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union."
13811,-3,0,And all you hear about is how bad things are.
13973,-3,0,"If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?"
1985,-3,0,"Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education."
15525,-3,0,"You know, the American people are fair."
33659,-3,0,"Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because..."
31891,-3,0,Certainly I'm not proud of it.
1040,-3,0,"But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country."
16228,-3,0,The American people are up to here with debates.
7418,-3,0,I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.
12736,-3,0,So that is my answer to this question.
18715,-3,0,"I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense."
7658,-3,0,I have talked to Negro mothers.
20850,-3,0,"But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to -- the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school."
29960,-3,0,It was very easy to do.
15175,-3,0,"Yes, I'd like to respond very much."
14213,-3,0,"The mistake that was made was making the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was."
26255,-3,0,"We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate."
19768,-3,0,And I don't intend to politicize it.
22802,-3,0,"Sorry, time for diplomacy is over."
20703,-3,0,We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.
15421,-3,0,I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.
24035,-3,0,"But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary."
12270,-3,0,"In other words, there are practical things we can do."
3160,-3,0,This has got to be stopped.
29851,-3,0,"But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods."
26342,-3,0,"So yes, I think it should be expanded."
11362,-3,0,I believe in its future.
6563,-3,0,We're not giving this away for nothing.
1443,-3,0,And that means that there will be more industrial activity.
26754,-3,0,"But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment."
13137,-3,0,"This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where."
26672,-3,0,"If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, ""Wait, that's enough."
28702,-3,0,I was on my peroration.
3231,-3,0,This has not been an ancient history story.
27613,-3,0,You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.
29898,-3,0,"Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country."
29699,-3,0,And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.
26056,-3,0,This is the United States of America.
2661,-3,0,This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.
16577,-3,0,And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.
15929,-3,0,So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.
13913,-3,0,"See, there's a lot I don't understand."
33152,-3,0,"That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans."
1115,-3,0,And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.
19323,-3,0,"Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn."
29395,-3,0,"What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy."
6351,-3,0,I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C.
16238,-3,0,"We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture."
16189,-3,0,"Come on, give me five."
17490,-3,0,Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?
8522,-3,0,"Well, I think they're serious."
22304,-3,0,"School choice -- public, private or religious."
3580,-3,0,"But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time."
3884,-3,0,An election law just in the last few days.
